This framework maps Access Control Lists (ACLs) to elements of the application's functionality; particularly URL's for web apps. In the case that the administrator failed to specify an ACL for a particular element, an attacker may be able to access it with impunity. An attacker with the ability to access functionality not properly constrained by ACLs can obtain sensitive information and possibly compromise the entire application. Such an attacker can access resources that must be available only to users at a higher privilege level, can access management sections of the application, or can run queries for data that they otherwise not supposed to."}],"cvss":4.9,"cvss-time":"2017-12-15T02:29:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:C/A:N","cwe":"CWE-434","id":"CVE-2017-12332","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2017-12-15T02:29:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102160","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039931","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171129-nxos1"],"refmap":{"bid":["102160"],"confirm":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171129-nxos1"],"sectrack":["1039931"]},"summary":"A vulnerability in Cisco NX-OS System Software patch installation could allow an authenticated, local attacker to write a file to arbitrary locations. The vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions in the patch installation process. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by installing a crafted patch image on an affected device. The vulnerable operation occurs prior to patch activation. An exploit could allow the attacker to write arbitrary files on an affected system as root. The attacker would need valid administrator credentials to perform this exploit. This vulnerability affects the following products running Cisco NX-OS System Software: Multilayer Director Switches, Nexus 2000 Series Fabric Extenders, Nexus 5000 Series Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Unified Computing System Manager.
