If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2017-10-11T18:21:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-14759","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2017-10-11T18:21:00","references":["http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Sep/97","https://knowledge.opentext.com/knowledge/llisapi.dll/Open/68982774"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Sep/97","https://knowledge.opentext.com/knowledge/llisapi.dll/Open/68982774"]},"summary":"OpenText Document Sciences xPression (formerly EMC Document Sciences xPression) v4.5SP1 Patch 13 (older versions might be affected as well) is prone to an XML External Entity vulnerability: /xFramework/services/QuickDoc.QuickDocHttpSoap11Endpoint/.
