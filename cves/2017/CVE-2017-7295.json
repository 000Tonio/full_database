A use-after-free vulnerability exists in httpd-simple.c in cc26xx-web-demo httpd, where upon a connection close event, the http_state structure was not deallocated properly, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference in the output processing function. This resulted in a board crash, which can be used to perform denial of service.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:contiki-os:contiki:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:contiki-os:contiki:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:contiki-os:contiki:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
