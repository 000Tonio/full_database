This issue could be triggered prior to authentication. The PSFTPd server did not automatically restart, which enabled attackers to perform a very effective DoS attack against this service. By sending a crafted SSH identification / version string to the server, a NULL pointer dereference could be caused, apparently because of a race condition in the window message handling, performing the cleanup for invalid connections. This incorrect cleanup code has a use-after-free.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:psftp:psftpd:10.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:psftp:psftpd:10.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:psftp:psftpd:10.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
