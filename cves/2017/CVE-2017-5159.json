You can use Sharefuzz to determine if you are exposing an environment variable vulnerable to buffer overflow.","summary":"This attack pattern involves causing a buffer overflow through manipulation of environment variables. Once the attacker finds that they can modify an environment variable, they may try to overflow associated buffers.
