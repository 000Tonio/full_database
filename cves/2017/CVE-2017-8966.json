Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":9,"cvss-time":"2018-02-24T18:53:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2017-8966","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2018-02-24T18:53:00","references":["http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039684","https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-hpesbhf03787en_us"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-hpesbhf03787en_us"],"sectrack":["1039684"]},"summary":"A Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in Hewlett Packard Enterprise Intelligent Management Center (iMC) PLAT version 7.3 E0504P2 was found.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:hp:intelligent_management_center:7.3:e0504p02:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:hp:intelligent_management_center:7.3:e0504p02:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:hp:intelligent_management_center:7.3:e0504p02:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
