Continued attacks by an unauthenticated, local user, can lead to persistent denials of services.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:juniper:northstar_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:juniper:northstar_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:juniper:northstar_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
