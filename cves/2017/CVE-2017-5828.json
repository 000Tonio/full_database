If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5.5,"cvss-time":"2019-03-11T14:29:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-5828","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-03-11T14:29:00","references":["http://www.arubanetworks.com/assets/alert/HPESBHF03730.txt","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98722","https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-hpesbhf03730en_us"],"refmap":{"bid":["98722"],"confirm":["http://www.arubanetworks.com/assets/alert/HPESBHF03730.txt","https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-hpesbhf03730en_us"]},"summary":"An arbitrary command execution vulnerability in HPE Aruba ClearPass Policy Manager version 6.6.x was found.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:hp:aruba_clearpass_policy_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:hp:aruba_clearpass_policy_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:hp:aruba_clearpass_policy_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
