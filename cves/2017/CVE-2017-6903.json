This also affects Quake III Arena, OpenArena, OpenJK, iortcw, and other id Tech 3 (aka Quake 3 engine) forks. A malicious auto-downloaded file can trigger loading of crafted auto-downloaded files as native code DLLs. A malicious auto-downloaded file can contain configuration defaults that override the user's. Executable bytecode in a malicious auto-downloaded file can set configuration variables to values that will result in unwanted native code DLLs being loaded, resulting in sandbox escape.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ioquake3:ioquake3:2017-02-27:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ioquake3:ioquake3:2017-02-27:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:ioquake3:ioquake3:2017-02-27:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
