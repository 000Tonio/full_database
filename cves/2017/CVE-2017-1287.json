By persuading a victim to visit a specially-crafted Web site, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to spoof the URL displayed to redirect a user to a malicious Web site that would appear to be trusted. This could allow the attacker to obtain highly sensitive information or conduct further attacks against the victim.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:5.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:5.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:5.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:5.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:6.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:6.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:6.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:6.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:6.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:6.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:5.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:5.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:6.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:6.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ibm:rhapsody_design_manager:6.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
