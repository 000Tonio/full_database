If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2019-10-31T02:33:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-15725","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-31T02:33:00","references":["https://il.linkedin.com/in/nivlevy"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://il.linkedin.com/in/nivlevy"]},"summary":"An XML External Entity Injection vulnerability exists in Dzone AnswerHub.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:devada:dzone_answerhub:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:devada:dzone_answerhub:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:devada:dzone_answerhub:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
