While the server is hung, print jobs over the network are blocked and the web interface is inaccessible. An attacker can continuously send this malformed request to keep the device inaccessible to legitimate traffic.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:brother:dcp-j132w_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:brother:dcp-j132w_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:brother:dcp-j132w:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:brother:dcp-j132w:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:brother:dcp-j132w_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
