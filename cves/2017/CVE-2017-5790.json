Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":10,"cvss-time":"2018-03-07T16:02:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2017-5790","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2018-03-07T16:02:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96755","https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-hpesbhf03710en_us","https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2017-12"],"refmap":{"bid":["96755"],"confirm":["https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-hpesbhf03710en_us"],"misc":["https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2017-12"]},"summary":"A remote deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability in HPE Intelligent Management Center (IMC) PLAT version 7.2 E0403P06 was found.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:hp:intelligent_management_center:7.2:e0403p06:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:hp:intelligent_management_center:7.2:e0403p06:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:hp:intelligent_management_center:7.2:e0403p06:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
