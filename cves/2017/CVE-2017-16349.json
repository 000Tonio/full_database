If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5.5,"cvss-time":"2023-01-30T19:59:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-16349","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2023-01-30T19:59:00","references":["https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/SAP"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/SAP"]},"summary":"An exploitable XML external entity vulnerability exists in the reporting functionality of SAP BPC.
