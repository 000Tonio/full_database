If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2017-10-10T17:49:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-14527","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2017-10-10T17:49:00","references":["http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Sep/58","https://knowledge.opentext.com/knowledge/llisapi.dll/Open/68982774"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://knowledge.opentext.com/knowledge/llisapi.dll/Open/68982774"],"fulldisc":["20170925 OpenText Documentum Administrator and Webtop - XML External Entity Injection"]},"summary":"Multiple XML external entity (XXE) vulnerabilities in the OpenText Documentum Webtop 6.8.0160.0073 allow remote authenticated users to list the contents of arbitrary directories, read arbitrary files, cause a denial of service, or, on Windows, obtain Documentum user hashes via a (1) crafted DTD, involving unspecified XML structures in a request to xda/com/documentum/ucf/server/transport/impl/GAIRConnector or crafted XML file in a MediaProfile file (2) import or (3) check in.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:opentext:documentum_administrator:7.2.0180.0055:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:opentext:documentum_administrator:7.2.0180.0055:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:opentext:documentum_webtop:6.8.0160.0073:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:opentext:documentum_webtop:6.8.0160.0073:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:opentext:documentum_administrator:7.2.0180.0055:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:opentext:documentum_webtop:6.8.0160.0073:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
