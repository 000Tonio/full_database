If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.4,"cvss-time":"2019-10-03T00:03:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-3548","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-03T00:03:00","references":["http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuapr2017-3236618.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97880","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038301","https://erpscan.io/advisories/erpscan-17-020-xxe-via-doctype-peoplesoft/","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41925/"],"refmap":{"bid":["97880"],"confirm":["http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuapr2017-3236618.html"],"exploit-db":["41925"],"misc":["https://erpscan.io/advisories/erpscan-17-020-xxe-via-doctype-peoplesoft/"],"sectrack":["1038301"]},"summary":"Vulnerability in the PeopleSoft Enterprise PeopleTools component of Oracle PeopleSoft Products (subcomponent: Integration Broker).
