If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2020-07-07T18:22:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-8110","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-07-07T18:22:00","references":["http://jgj212.blogspot.hk/2017/04/modified-ecommerce-shopsoftware-2022.html"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://jgj212.blogspot.hk/2017/04/modified-ecommerce-shopsoftware-2022.html"]},"summary":"www.modified-shop.org modified eCommerce Shopsoftware 2.0.2.2 rev 10690 has XXE in api/it-recht-kanzlei/api-it-recht-kanzlei.php.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:modified-shop:modified_ecommerce_shopsoftware:2.0.2.2:revision10690:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:modified-shop:modified_ecommerce_shopsoftware:2.0.2.2:revision10690:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:modified-shop:modified_ecommerce_shopsoftware:2.0.2.2:revision10690:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
