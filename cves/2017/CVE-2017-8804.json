Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.8,"cvss-time":"2020-08-26T14:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2017-8804","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-08-26T14:15:00","references":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2018-02/msg00026.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2018-02/msg00039.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2018-02/msg00049.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/05/05/2","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98339","https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1037559#c7","https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q2/228","https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21461","https://sourceware.org/legacy-ml/libc-alpha/2017-05/msg00128.html","https://sourceware.org/legacy-ml/libc-alpha/2017-05/msg00129.html","https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2017-05/msg00105.html"],"refmap":{"bid":["98339"],"confirm":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/05/05/2","https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1037559#c7","https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=21461","https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2017-05/msg00105.html"],"misc":["https://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q2/228","https://sourceware.org/legacy-ml/libc-alpha/2017-05/msg00128.html","https://sourceware.org/legacy-ml/libc-alpha/2017-05/msg00129.html"],"suse":["SUSE-SU-2018:0451","SUSE-SU-2018:0565","openSUSE-SU-2018:0494"]},"summary":"** DISPUTED ** The xdr_bytes and xdr_string functions in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.25 mishandle failures of buffer deserialization, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (virtual memory allocation, or memory consumption if an overcommit setting is not used) via a crafted UDP packet to port 111, a related issue to CVE-2017-8779.
