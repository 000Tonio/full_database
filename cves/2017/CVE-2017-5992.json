If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5.8,"cvss-time":"2017-02-17T14:00:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-5992","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2017-02-17T14:00:00","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/02/07/5","https://bitbucket.org/openpyxl/openpyxl/commits/3b4905f428e1","https://bitbucket.org/openpyxl/openpyxl/issues/749","https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=854442"],"refmap":{"confirm":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/02/07/5","https://bitbucket.org/openpyxl/openpyxl/commits/3b4905f428e1","https://bitbucket.org/openpyxl/openpyxl/issues/749","https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=854442"]},"summary":"Openpyxl 2.4.1 resolves external entities by default, which allows remote attackers to conduct XXE attacks via a crafted .xlsx document.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:python:openpyxl:2.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:python:openpyxl:2.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:python:openpyxl:2.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
