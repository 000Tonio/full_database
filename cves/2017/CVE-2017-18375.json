Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2019-05-30T00:28:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2017-18375","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-05-30T00:28:00","references":["https://fenceposterror.github.io/2017/06/16/Hacking-For-Fun-And-Non-Profit.html"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://fenceposterror.github.io/2017/06/16/Hacking-For-Fun-And-Non-Profit.html"]},"summary":"Ampache 3.8.3 allows PHP Object Instantiation via democratic.ajax.php and democratic.class.php.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ampache:ampache:3.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ampache:ampache:3.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:ampache:ampache:3.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
