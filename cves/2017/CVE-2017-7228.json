Use secure functions not vulnerable to buffer overflow. If you have to use dangerous functions, make sure that you do boundary checking. Compiler-based canary mechanisms such as StackGuard, ProPolice and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag. Unless this provides automatic bounds checking, it is not a complete solution. Use OS-level preventative functionality. Not a complete solution. Utilize static source code analysis tools to identify potential buffer overflow weaknesses in the software.","summary":"Buffer Overflow attacks target improper or missing bounds checking on buffer operations, typically triggered by input injected by an adversary. As a consequence, an adversary is able to write past the boundaries of allocated buffer regions in memory, causing a program crash or potentially redirection of execution as per the adversaries' choice."}],"cvss":7.2,"cvss-time":"2019-10-03T00:03:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-129","id":"CVE-2017-7228","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-03T00:03:00","references":["http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/04/04/3","http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3847","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97375","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038223","http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-212.html","https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-secpack/blob/master/QSBs/qsb-029-2017.txt","https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2017/04/pandavirtualization-exploiting-xen.html","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41870/"],"refmap":{"bid":["97375"],"confirm":["http://openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/04/04/3","http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-212.html","https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-secpack/blob/master/QSBs/qsb-029-2017.txt"],"debian":["DSA-3847"],"exploit-db":["41870"],"misc":["https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2017/04/pandavirtualization-exploiting-xen.html"],"sectrack":["1038223"]},"summary":"An issue (known as XSA-212) was discovered in Xen, with fixes available for 4.8.x, 4.7.x, 4.6.x, 4.5.x, and 4.4.x.
