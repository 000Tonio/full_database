In the circumstances of this issue, the capability of exploit is limited by the need to perform multiple file and directory writes to the local filesystem and as such, is not feasible in a standard drive-by type attack.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:symantec:endpoint_protection:*:m9:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:symantec:endpoint_protection:*:m9:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:symantec:endpoint_protection:*:m9:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
