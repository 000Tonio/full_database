When using a code book, application error messages aren't generated in string or stack trace form, but are catalogued and replaced with a unique (often integer-based) value 'coding' for the error. Such a technique will require helpdesk and hosting personnel to use a 'code book' or similar mapping to decode application errors/logs in order to respond to them normally. Design: wrap application functionality (preferably through the underlying framework) in an output encoding scheme that obscures or cleanses error messages to prevent such attacks. Such a technique is often used in conjunction with the above 'code book' suggestion. Implementation: Obfuscate server fields of HTTP response. Implementation: Hide inner ordering of HTTP response header. Implementation: Customizing HTTP error codes such as 404 or 500. Implementation: Hide HTTP response header software information filed. Implementation: Hide cookie's software information filed. Implementation: Obfuscate database type in Database API's error message.","summary":"An attacker sends random, malformed, or otherwise unexpected messages to a target application and observes the application's log or error messages returned. Fuzzing techniques involve sending random or malformed messages to a target and monitoring the target's response. The attacker does not initially know how a target will respond to individual messages but by attempting a large number of message variants they may find a variant that trigger's desired behavior. In this attack, the purpose of the fuzzing is to observe the application's log and error messages, although fuzzing a target can also sometimes cause the target to enter an unstable state, causing a crash. By observing logs and error messages, the attacker can learn details about the configuration of the target application and might be able to cause the target to disclose sensitive information."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2019-10-03T00:03:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-532","id":"CVE-2017-9615","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-03T00:03:00","references":["http://cognito.co.nz/mwcommunity/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=3542","https://gist.github.com/ari/e0dd74c12d84f102e3bcb365118e8c30"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://cognito.co.nz/mwcommunity/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=3542","https://gist.github.com/ari/e0dd74c12d84f102e3bcb365118e8c30"]},"summary":"Password exposure in Cognito Software Moneyworks 8.0.3 and earlier allows attackers to gain administrator access to all data, because verbose logging writes the administrator password to a world-readable file.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cognito:moneyworks:8.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cognito:moneyworks:8.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:cognito:moneyworks:8.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
