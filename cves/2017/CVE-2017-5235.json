The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2017-03-07T16:24:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2017-5235","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2017-03-07T16:24:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96548","https://community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2017/03/01/multiple-vulnerabilities-affecting-four-rapid7-products"],"refmap":{"bid":["96548"],"confirm":["https://community.rapid7.com/community/infosec/blog/2017/03/01/multiple-vulnerabilities-affecting-four-rapid7-products"]},"summary":"Rapid7 Metasploit Pro installers prior to version 4.13.0-2017022101 contain a DLL preloading vulnerability, wherein it is possible for the installer to load a malicious DLL located in the current working directory of the installer.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:metasploit:4.11.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:metasploit:4.11.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:metasploit:4.12.40:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:metasploit:4.12.40:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:metasploit:4.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:metasploit:4.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:metasploit:4.11.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:metasploit:4.12.40:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:metasploit:4.13.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
