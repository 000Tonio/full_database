If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2018-01-12T16:35:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-14101","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2018-01-12T16:35:00","references":["https://technical.nttsecurity.com/post/102emjg/conserus-image-repository-xml-external-entity-vulnerability"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://technical.nttsecurity.com/post/102emjg/conserus-image-repository-xml-external-entity-vulnerability"]},"summary":"A security researcher found an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability on the Conserus Image Repository archive solution version 2.1.1.105 by McKesson Medical Imaging Company, which is now a Change Healthcare company.
