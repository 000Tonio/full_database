Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.2,"cvss-time":"2017-11-08T16:29:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2017-12628","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2017-11-08T16:29:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101532","https://www.mail-archive.com/server-user@james.apache.org/msg15633.html"],"refmap":{"bid":["101532"],"mlist":["[server-user] 20171019 Announce: Apache James 3.0.1 security release"]},"summary":"The JMX server embedded in Apache James, also used by the command line client is exposed to a java de-serialization issue, and thus can be used to execute arbitrary commands.
