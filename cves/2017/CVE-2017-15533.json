All affected SSLV versions act as weak oracles according the oracle classification used in the ROBOT research paper. A remote attacker, who has captured a pre-recorded SSL session inspected by SSLV, can establish multiple millions of crafted SSL connections to the target and obtain the session keys required to decrypt the pre-recorded SSL session.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:ssl_visibility_appliance:3.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:ssl_visibility_appliance:3.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:ssl_visibility_appliance:3.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:ssl_visibility_appliance:3.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:ssl_visibility_appliance:3.8.4fc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:ssl_visibility_appliance:3.8.4fc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:ssl_visibility_appliance:3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:ssl_visibility_appliance:3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:ssl_visibility_appliance:3.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:ssl_visibility_appliance:3.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:ssl_visibility_appliance:3.8.4fc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:ssl_visibility_appliance:3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
