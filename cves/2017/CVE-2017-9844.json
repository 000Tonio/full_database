Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2018-12-10T19:29:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2017-9844","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-12-10T19:29:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96865","https://erpscan.io/advisories/erpscan-17-014-sap-netweaver-java-deserialization-untrusted-user-value-metadatauploader/"],"refmap":{"bid":["96865"],"misc":["https://erpscan.io/advisories/erpscan-17-014-sap-netweaver-java-deserialization-untrusted-user-value-metadatauploader/"]},"summary":"SAP NetWeaver 7400.12.21.30308 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted serialized Java object in a request to metadatauploader, aka SAP Security Note 2399804.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver:7400.12.21.30308:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver:7400.12.21.30308:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver:7400.12.21.30308:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
