However, if the same brute force attempt is performed using the ONVIF specification (which is supported by the same binary) then there is no account lockout or timeout executed. This can allow an attacker to circumvent the account protection mechanism and brute force the credentials. If the firmware version V2.420.AC00.16.R 9/9/2016 is dissected using binwalk tool, one obtains a _user-x.squashfs.img.extracted archive which contains the filesystem set up on the device that many of the binaries in the /usr folder. The binary \"sonia\" is the one that has the vulnerable function that performs the credential check in the binary for the ONVIF specification. If one opens this binary in IDA-pro one will notice that this follows a ARM little endian format. The function at address 00671618 in IDA pro is parses the WSSE security token header. The sub_ 603D8 then performs the authentication check and if it is incorrect passes to the function sub_59F4C which prints the value \"Sender not authorized.\"","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:amcrest:ipm-721s_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:amcrest:ipm-721s_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:amcrest:ipm-721s:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:amcrest:ipm-721s:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:amcrest:ipm-721s_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
