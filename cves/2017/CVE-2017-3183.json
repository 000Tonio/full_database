Sage XRT Treasury is a business finance management application. Database user access privileges are determined by the USER_CODE field associated with the querying user. By modifying the USER_CODE value to match that of a privileged user, a low-privileged, authenticated user may gain privileged access to the SQL database. A remote, authenticated user can submit specially crafted SQL queries to gain privileged access to the application database.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sage:xrt_treasury:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sage:xrt_treasury:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sage:xrt_treasury:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
