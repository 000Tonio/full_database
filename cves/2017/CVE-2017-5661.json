If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.9,"cvss-time":"2021-07-22T18:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:N/A:C","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-5661","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-07-22T18:15:00","references":["https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/security.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97947","http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3864"],"refmap":{"bid":["97947"],"confirm":["https://xmlgraphics.apache.org/security.html"],"debian":["DSA-3864"]},"summary":"In Apache FOP before 2.2, files lying on the filesystem of the server which uses FOP can be revealed to arbitrary users who send maliciously formed SVG files. The file types that can be shown depend on the user context in which the exploitable application is running. If the user is root a full compromise of the server - including confidential or sensitive files - would be possible. XXE can also be used to attack the availability of the server via denial of service as the references within a xml document can trivially trigger an amplification attack.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:formatting_objects_processor:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:formatting_objects_processor:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:formatting_objects_processor:1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:formatting_objects_processor:1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:formatting_objects_processor:2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:formatting_objects_processor:2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:formatting_objects_processor:2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:formatting_objects_processor:2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:apache:formatting_objects_processor:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:apache:formatting_objects_processor:1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:apache:formatting_objects_processor:2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:apache:formatting_objects_processor:2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
