The adversary must have access to the target, albeit with an account that is less privileged than would be appropriate for the targeted resources.","related_weakness":["269","732"],"solutions":"","summary":"An adversary is able to exploit features of the target that should be reserved for privileged users or administrators but are exposed to use by lower or non-privileged accounts. Access to sensitive information and functionality must be controlled to ensure that only authorized users are able to access these resources. If access control mechanisms are absent or misconfigured, a user may be able to access resources that are intended only for higher level users. An adversary may be able to exploit this to utilize a less trusted account to gain information and perform activities reserved for more trusted accounts. This attack differs from privilege escalation and other privilege stealing attacks in that the adversary never actually escalates their privileges but instead is able to use a lesser degree of privilege to access resources that should be (but are not) reserved for higher privilege accounts. Likewise, the adversary does not exploit trust or subvert systems - all control functionality is working as configured but the configuration does not adequately protect sensitive resources at an appropriate level."},{"id":"58","name":"Restful Privilege Elevation","prerequisites":"The attacker needs to be able to identify HTTP Get URLs. The Get methods must be set to call applications that perform operations other than get such as update and delete.","related_weakness":["264","267","269"],"solutions":"Design: Enforce principle of least privilege Implementation: Ensure that HTTP Get methods only retrieve state and do not alter state on the server side Implementation: Ensure that HTTP methods have proper ACLs based on what the functionality they expose","summary":"Rest uses standard HTTP (Get, Put, Delete) style permissions methods, but these are not necessarily correlated generally with back end programs. Strict interpretation of HTTP get methods means that these HTTP Get services should not be used to delete information on the server, but there is no access control mechanism to back up this logic. This means that unless the services are properly ACL'd and the application's service implementation are following these guidelines then an HTTP request can easily execute a delete or update on the server side. The attacker identifies a HTTP Get URL such as http://victimsite/updateOrder, which calls out to a program to update orders on a database or other resource. The URL is not idempotent so the request can be submitted multiple times by the attacker, additionally, the attacker may be able to exploit the URL published as a Get method that actually performs updates (instead of merely retrieving data). This may result in malicious or inadvertent altering of data on the server."}],"cvss":7.2,"cvss-time":"2019-10-03T00:03:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-269","id":"CVE-2017-5671","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-03T00:03:00","references":["http://apps.intermec.com/downloads/eps_download/Firmware%20Release%20Notes%20x10_11_013310.pdf","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97236","https://akerva.com/blog/intermec-industrial-printers-local-root-with-busybox-jailbreak/","https://github.com/kmkz/exploit/blob/master/CVE-2017-5671-Credits.pdf","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41754/"],"refmap":{"bid":["97236"],"confirm":["http://apps.intermec.com/downloads/eps_download/Firmware%20Release%20Notes%20x10_11_013310.pdf","https://github.com/kmkz/exploit/blob/master/CVE-2017-5671-Credits.pdf"],"exploit-db":["41754"],"misc":["https://akerva.com/blog/intermec-industrial-printers-local-root-with-busybox-jailbreak/"]},"summary":"Honeywell Intermec PM23, PM42, PM43, PC23, PC43, PD43, and PC42 industrial printers before 10.11.013310 and 10.12.x before 10.12.013309 have /usr/bin/lua installed setuid to the itadmin account, which allows local users to conduct a BusyBox jailbreak attack and obtain root privileges by overwriting the /etc/shadow file.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:intermec_pc23_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:intermec_pc23_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:intermec_pc42_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:intermec_pc42_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:intermec_pc43_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:intermec_pc43_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:intermec_pd43_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:intermec_pd43_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:intermec_pm23_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:intermec_pm23_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:intermec_pm42_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:intermec_pm42_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:intermec_pm43_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:intermec_pm43_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:honeywell:intermec_pc23:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:honeywell:intermec_pc23:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:honeywell:intermec_pc42:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:honeywell:intermec_pc42:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:honeywell:intermec_pc43:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:honeywell:intermec_pc43:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:honeywell:intermec_pd43:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:honeywell:intermec_pd43:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:honeywell:intermec_pm23:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:honeywell:intermec_pm23:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:honeywell:intermec_pm42:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:honeywell:intermec_pm42:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:honeywell:intermec_pm43:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:honeywell:intermec_pm43:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:intermec_pc23_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:intermec_pc42_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:intermec_pc43_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:intermec_pd43_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:intermec_pm23_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:intermec_pm42_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:honeywell:intermec_pm43_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
