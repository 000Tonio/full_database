If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2017-03-16T19:04:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-6055","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2017-03-16T19:04:00","references":["https://cert.lv/lv/2017/02/iznakusas-nedelas-zinas-par-drosibas-incidentiem-nr-4-2017","https://www.eparaksts.lv/en/Assistance/downloads/eparakstitajs-3-0/previous-versions-of-eparakstitajs-3-0/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://cert.lv/lv/2017/02/iznakusas-nedelas-zinas-par-drosibas-incidentiem-nr-4-2017","https://www.eparaksts.lv/en/Assistance/downloads/eparakstitajs-3-0/previous-versions-of-eparakstitajs-3-0/"]},"summary":"XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in eParakstitajs 3 before 1.3.9 and eParaksts Java lib before 2.5.13 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted edoc file.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:eparaksts:eparakstitajs_3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:eparaksts:eparakstitajs_3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:eparaksts:eparakstitajs_3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
