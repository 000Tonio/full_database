Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2020-07-29T16:36:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2017-14702","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-07-29T16:36:00","references":["https://github.com/wshepherd0010/advisories/blob/master/CVE-2017-14702.md","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42952/"],"refmap":{"exploit-db":["42952"],"misc":["https://github.com/wshepherd0010/advisories/blob/master/CVE-2017-14702.md"]},"summary":"ERS Data System 1.8.1.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, related to \"com.branaghgroup.ecers.update.UpdateRequest\" object deserialization.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:branaghgroup:ers_data_system:1.8.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:branaghgroup:ers_data_system:1.8.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:branaghgroup:ers_data_system:1.8.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
