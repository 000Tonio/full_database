Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2018-02-24T16:37:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2017-5792","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-02-24T16:37:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96769","https://h20566.www2.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docLocale=en_US&docId=emr_na-hpesbhf03713en_us","https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-hpesbhf03815en_us","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43927/","https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2017-18","https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2018-01"],"refmap":{"bid":["96769"],"confirm":["https://h20566.www2.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docLocale=en_US&docId=emr_na-hpesbhf03713en_us","https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-hpesbhf03815en_us"],"exploit-db":["43927"],"misc":["https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2017-18","https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2018-01"]},"summary":"A Remote Code Execution vulnerability in HPE Intelligent Management Center (iMC) PLAT version 7.3 E0504P2 was found.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:hp:intelligent_management_center:7.3:e0504p02:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:hp:intelligent_management_center:7.3:e0504p02:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:hp:intelligent_management_center:7.3:e0504p02:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
