This denial of service attack requires substantially fewer packets to be sent which makes DoS harder to detect. This is an equivalent of SYN flood in HTTP. The idea is to keep the HTTP session alive indefinitely and then repeat that hundreds of times. This attack targets resource depletion weaknesses in web server software. The web server will wait to attacker's responses on the initiated HTTP sessions while the connection threads are being exhausted."}],"cvss":3.3,"cvss-time":"2019-10-03T00:03:00","cvss-vector":"AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-772","id":"CVE-2017-3803","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-03T00:03:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95632","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1037657","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170118-catalyst"],"refmap":{"bid":["95632"],"confirm":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170118-catalyst"],"sectrack":["1037657"]},"summary":"A vulnerability in the Cisco IOS Software forwarding queue of Cisco 2960X and 3750X switches could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a memory leak in the software forwarding queue that would eventually lead to a partial denial of service (DoS) condition.
