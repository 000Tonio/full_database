If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5.5,"cvss-time":"2022-04-19T19:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-2815","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-04-19T19:15:00","references":["https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2017-0316"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2017-0316"]},"summary":"An exploitable XML entity injection vulnerability exists in OpenFire User Import Export Plugin 2.6.0.
