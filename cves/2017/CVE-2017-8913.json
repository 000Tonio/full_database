If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2021-04-20T19:37:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-8913","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-04-20T19:37:00","references":["https://erpscan.io/press-center/blog/sap-cyber-threat-intelligence-report-february-2017/","https://erpscan.io/advisories/erpscan-17-007-sap-netweaver-java-7-5-xxe-visual-composer-vc70runtime/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://erpscan.io/advisories/erpscan-17-007-sap-netweaver-java-7-5-xxe-visual-composer-vc70runtime/","https://erpscan.io/press-center/blog/sap-cyber-threat-intelligence-report-february-2017/"]},"summary":"The Visual Composer VC70RUNTIME component in SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA 7.5 allows remote authenticated users to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks via a crafted XML document in a request to irj/servlet/prt/portal/prtroot/com.sap.visualcomposer.BIKit.default, aka SAP Security Note 2386873.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver_application_server_java:7.50:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver_application_server_java:7.50:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver_application_server_java:7.50:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
