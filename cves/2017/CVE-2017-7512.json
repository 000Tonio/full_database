An attacker could use this flaw to circumvent authentication controls and gain access to restricted APIs. NOTE: some sources have a typo in which CVE-2017-7512 maps to an OpenVPN vulnerability. The proper CVE ID for that OpenVPN vulnerability is CVE-2017-7521. Specifically, CVE-2017-7521 is the correct CVE ID for TWO closely related findings in OpenVPN. Any source that lists BOTH CVE-2017-7512 and CVE-2017-7521 for OpenVPN should have listed ONLY CVE-2017-7521.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:redhat:3scale_api_management_platform:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:redhat:3scale_api_management_platform:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:redhat:3scale_api_management_platform:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
