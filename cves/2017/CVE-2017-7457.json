If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":1.9,"cvss-time":"2017-08-16T01:29:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-7457","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2017-08-16T01:29:00","references":["http://hyp3rlinx.altervista.org/advisories/MOXA-MX-AOPC-SERVER-v1.5-XML-EXTERNAL-ENTITY.txt","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Apr/51","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41852/"],"refmap":{"exploit-db":["41852"],"fulldisc":["20170411 Moxa MX AOPC-Server v1.5 XML External Entity"],"misc":["http://hyp3rlinx.altervista.org/advisories/MOXA-MX-AOPC-SERVER-v1.5-XML-EXTERNAL-ENTITY.txt"]},"summary":"XML External Entity via \".AOP\" files used by Moxa MX-AOPC Server 1.5 result in remote file disclosure.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:moxa:mx-aopc_server:1.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:moxa:mx-aopc_server:1.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:moxa:mx-aopc_server:1.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
