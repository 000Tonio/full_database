If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2017-03-02T15:34:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-6344","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2017-03-02T15:34:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96446","https://www.ambionics.io/blog/grails-pdf-plugin-xxe"],"refmap":{"bid":["96446"],"misc":["https://www.ambionics.io/blog/grails-pdf-plugin-xxe"]},"summary":"XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in Grails PDF Plugin 0.6 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a crafted XML document.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:grails:pdf_plugin:0.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:grails:pdf_plugin:0.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:grails:pdf_plugin:0.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
