Due to the user-specific configuration being loaded from \"~/.confire.yaml\" using the yaml.load function, a YAML parser can execute arbitrary Python commands resulting in command execution. An attacker can insert Python into loaded YAML to trigger this vulnerability.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:confire_project:confire:0.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:confire_project:confire:0.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:confire_project:confire:0.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
