Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2017-09-01T20:45:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2017-14035","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2017-09-01T20:45:00","references":["https://crushftp.com/version8.html"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://crushftp.com/version8.html"]},"summary":"CrushFTP 8.x before 8.2.0 has a serialization vulnerability.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crushftp:crushftp:8.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crushftp:crushftp:8.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crushftp:crushftp:8.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crushftp:crushftp:8.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crushftp:crushftp:8.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crushftp:crushftp:8.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crushftp:crushftp:8.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crushftp:crushftp:8.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:crushftp:crushftp:8.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crushftp:crushftp:8.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crushftp:crushftp:8.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crushftp:crushftp:8.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
