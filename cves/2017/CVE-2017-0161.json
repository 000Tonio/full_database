A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2017-09-21T17:10:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2017-0161","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2017-09-21T17:10:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100728","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039318","https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0161"],"refmap":{"bid":["100728"],"confirm":["https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2017-0161"],"sectrack":["1039318"]},"summary":"The Windows NetBT Session Services component on Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2, Windows RT 8.1, Windows 10 Gold, 1511, 1607, and 1703, and Windows Server 2016 allows a remote code execution vulnerability when it fails to maintain certain sequencing requirements, aka \"NetBIOS Remote Code Execution Vulnerability\".","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:1511:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:1511:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:1607:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:1607:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:1703:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:1703:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_7:*:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_7:*:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_rt_8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_rt_8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2008:*:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2008:*:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2008:r2:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2008:r2:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2012:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2012:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2012:r2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2012:r2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2016:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2016:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:1511:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:1607:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_10:1703:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_7:*:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_rt_8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2008:*:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2008:r2:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2012:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2012:r2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2016:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
