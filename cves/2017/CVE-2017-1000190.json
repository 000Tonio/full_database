If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.4,"cvss-time":"2019-07-23T20:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-1000190","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-07-23T20:15:00","references":["https://github.com/ngallagher/simplexml/issues/18","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/708d94141126eac03011144a971a6411fcac16d9c248d1d535a39451@%3Csolr-user.lucene.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/8c4ef27e2c0218f29e785990dc919266855aea137c958f10d242cb36@%3Cdev.lucene.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r204ba2a9ea750f38d789d2bb429cc0925ad6133deea7cbc3001d96b5@%3Csolr-user.lucene.apache.org%3E"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://github.com/ngallagher/simplexml/issues/18"],"mlist":["[lucene-dev] 20190723 [jira] [Updated] (SOLR-13648) vulnerable simple-xml-2.7.1.jar","[lucene-solr-user] 20190104 Re: SOLR v7 Security Issues Caused Denial of Use - Sonatype Application Composition Report","[lucene-solr-user] 20200320 CVEs (vulnerabilities) that apply to Solr 8.4.1","[lucene-solr-user] 20200320 Re: CVEs (vulnerabilities) that apply to Solr 8.4.1"]},"summary":"SimpleXML (latest version 2.7.1) is vulnerable to an XXE vulnerability resulting SSRF, information disclosure, DoS and so on.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:simplexml_project:simplexml:2.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:simplexml_project:simplexml:2.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:simplexml_project:simplexml:2.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
