Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":10,"cvss-time":"2023-06-27T15:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2017-4947","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2023-06-27T15:15:00","references":["https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2018-0006.html","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040290","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040289","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102852"],"refmap":{"bid":["102852"],"confirm":["https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2018-0006.html"],"sectrack":["1040289","1040290"]},"summary":"VMware vRealize Automation (7.3 and 7.2) and vSphere Integrated Containers (1.x before 1.3) contain a deserialization vulnerability via Xenon.
