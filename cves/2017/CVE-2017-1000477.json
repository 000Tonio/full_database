If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2018-01-17T17:51:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-1000477","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2018-01-17T17:51:00","references":["https://github.com/pravednik/xmlBundle","https://github.com/pravednik/xmlBundle/issues/2"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/pravednik/xmlBundle","https://github.com/pravednik/xmlBundle/issues/2"]},"summary":"XMLBundle version 0.1.7 is vulnerable to XXE attacks which can result in denial of service attacks.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:xmlbundle_project:xmlbundle:0.1.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:xmlbundle_project:xmlbundle:0.1.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:xmlbundle_project:xmlbundle:0.1.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
