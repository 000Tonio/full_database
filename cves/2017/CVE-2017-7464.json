If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2023-02-12T23:29:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-7464","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2023-02-12T23:29:00","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2017-7464","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98450"],"refmap":{"bid":["98450"],"confirm":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2017-7464"]},"summary":"It was found that the JAXP implementation used in JBoss EAP 7.0 for SAX and DOM parsing is vulnerable to certain XXE flaws.
