Implement a password throttling mechanism. This mechanism should take into account both the IP address and the log in name of the user. Put together a strong password policy and make sure that all user created passwords comply with it. Alternatively automatically generate strong passwords for users. Passwords need to be recycled to prevent aging, that is every once in a while a new password must be chosen.","summary":"An adversary may try certain common or default usernames and passwords to gain access into the system and perform unauthorized actions. An adversary may try an intelligent brute force using empty passwords, known vendor default credentials, as well as a dictionary of common usernames and passwords. Many vendor products come preconfigured with default (and thus well-known) usernames and passwords that should be deleted prior to usage in a production environment. It is a common mistake to forget to remove these default login credentials. Another problem is that users would pick very simple (common) passwords (e.g. \"secret\" or \"password\") that make it easier for the attacker to gain access to the system compared to using a brute force attack or even a dictionary attack using a full dictionary."},{"id":"191","name":"Read Sensitive Strings Within an Executable","prerequisites":"Access to a binary or executable such that it can be analyzed by various utilities.","related_weakness":["798"],"solutions":"","summary":"An adversary engages in activities to discover any sensitive strings are present within the compiled code of an executable, such as literal ASCII strings within the file itself, or possibly strings hard-coded into particular routines that can be revealed by code refactoring methods including static and dynamic analysis. One specific example of a sensitive string is a hard-coded password. Typical examples of software with hard-coded passwords include server-side executables which may check for a hard-coded password or key during a user's authentication with the server. Hard-coded passwords can also be present in client-side executables which utilize the password or key when connecting to either a remote component, such as a database server, licensing server, or otherwise, or a processes on the same host that expects a key or password. When analyzing an executable the adversary may search for the presence of such strings by analyzing the byte-code of the file itself. Example utilities for revealing strings within a file include 'strings,' 'grep,' or other variants of these programs depending upon the type of operating system used. These programs can be used to dump any ASCII or UNICODE strings contained within a program. Strings can also be searched for using a hex editors by loading the binary or object code file and utilizing native search functions such as regular expressions."}],"cvss":10,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:26:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-798","id":"CVE-2017-2343","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:26:00","references":["http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038904","https://kb.juniper.net/JSA10791"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://kb.juniper.net/JSA10791"],"sectrack":["1038904"]},"summary":"The Integrated User Firewall (UserFW) feature was introduced in Junos OS version 12.1X47-D10 on the Juniper SRX Series devices to provide simple integration of user profiles on top of the existing firewall polices. As part of an internal security review of the UserFW services authentication API, hardcoded credentials were identified and removed which can impact both the SRX Series device, and potentially LDAP and Active Directory integrated points. An attacker may be able to completely compromise SRX Series devices, as well as Active Directory servers and services. When Active Directory is compromised, it may allow access to user credentials, workstations, servers performing other functions such as email, database, etc. Inter-Forest Active Directory deployments may also be at risk as the attacker may gain full administrative control over one or more Active Directories depending on the credentials supplied by the administrator of the AD domains and SRX devices performing integrated authentication of users, groups and devices. To identify if your device is potentially vulnerable to exploitation, check to see if the service is operating; from CLI review the following output: root@SRX-Firewall# run show services user-identification active-directory-access domain-controller status extensive A result of \"Status: Connected\" will indicate that the service is active on the device. To evaluate if user authentication is occurring through the device: root@SRX-Firewall# run show services user-identification active-directory-access active-directory-authentication-table all Next review the results to see if valid users and groups are returned. e.g. Domain: juniperlab.com Total entries: 3 Source IP Username groups state 172.16.26.1 administrator Valid 192.168.26.2 engg01 engineers Valid 192.168.26.3 guest01 guests Valid Domain: NULL Total entries: 8 Source IP Username groups state 192.168.26.4 Invalid 192.168.26.5 Invalid This will also indicate that Valid users and groups are authenticating through the device. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3X48 from 12.3X48-D30 and prior to 12.3X48-D35 on SRX series; 15.1X49 from 15.1X49-D40 and prior to 15.1X49-D50 on SRX series. Devices on any version of Junos OS 12.1X46, or 12.1X47 are unaffected by this issue.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:12.3x48:d10:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:12.3x48:d10:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:12.3x48:d15:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:12.3x48:d15:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:12.3x48:d20:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:12.3x48:d20:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:12.3x48:d25:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:12.3x48:d25:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:12.3x48:d30:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:12.3x48:d30:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:12.3x48:d35:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:12.3x48:d35:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:15.1x49:d40:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:15.1x49:d40:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:15.1x49:d45:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:15.1x49:d45:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx100:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx100:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx110:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx110:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx1400:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx1400:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx210:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx210:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx220:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx220:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx240:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx240:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx3400:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx3400:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx3600:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx3600:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx5400:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx5400:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx550:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx550:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx5600:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx5600:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx5800:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx5800:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx650:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:juniper:srx650:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:12.3x48:d10:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:12.3x48:d15:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:12.3x48:d20:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:12.3x48:d25:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:12.3x48:d30:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:12.3x48:d35:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:15.1x49:d40:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos:15.1x49:d45:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
