This denial of service attack requires substantially fewer packets to be sent which makes DoS harder to detect. This is an equivalent of SYN flood in HTTP. The idea is to keep the HTTP session alive indefinitely and then repeat that hundreds of times. This attack targets resource depletion weaknesses in web server software. The web server will wait to attacker's responses on the initiated HTTP sessions while the connection threads are being exhausted."}],"cvss":4.9,"cvss-time":"2020-05-20T16:08:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C","cwe":"CWE-772","id":"CVE-2017-6414","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-05-20T16:08:00","redhat":{"advisories":[{"rhsa":{"id":"RHSA-2017:2408"}}],"rpms":["qemu-img-rhev-10:2.9.0-10.el7","qemu-kvm-common-rhev-10:2.9.0-10.el7","qemu-kvm-rhev-10:2.9.0-10.el7","qemu-kvm-rhev-debuginfo-10:2.9.0-10.el7","qemu-kvm-tools-rhev-10:2.9.0-10.el7"]},"references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/03/01/11","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96541","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:2408","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1427833","https://cgit.freedesktop.org/spice/libcacard/commit/?id=9113dc6a303604a2d9812ac70c17d076ef11886c","https://cgit.freedesktop.org/spice/libcacard/tree/NEWS?id=aaa5251791bf0b1640afcba77a7d79ea23c42d53"],"refmap":{"bid":["96541"],"confirm":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1427833","https://cgit.freedesktop.org/spice/libcacard/commit/?id=9113dc6a303604a2d9812ac70c17d076ef11886c","https://cgit.freedesktop.org/spice/libcacard/tree/NEWS?id=aaa5251791bf0b1640afcba77a7d79ea23c42d53"],"mlist":["[oss-security] 20170301 CVE-2017-6414 Qemu: libcacard: host memory leakage while creating new APDU"]},"summary":"Memory leak in the vcard_apdu_new function in card_7816.c in libcacard before 2.5.3 allows local guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host memory consumption) via vectors related to allocating a new APDU object.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:libcacard_project:libcacard:2.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:libcacard_project:libcacard:2.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:libcacard_project:libcacard:2.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:libcacard_project:libcacard:2.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:libcacard_project:libcacard:2.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:libcacard_project:libcacard:2.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:libcacard_project:libcacard:2.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libcacard_project:libcacard:2.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:libcacard_project:libcacard:2.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
