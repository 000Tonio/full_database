Additionally, writing malicious data to log files may target jobs, filters, reports, and other agents that process the logs in an asynchronous attack pattern.

The system that uses a filter or a blacklist input validation, as opposed to whitelist validation is vulnerable to an attacker who predicts delimiters (or combinations of delimiters) not present in the filter or blacklist. As with other injection attacks, the attacker uses the command delimiter payload as an entry point to tunnel through the application and activate additional attacks through SQL queries, shell commands, network scanning, and so on."}],"cvss":3.3,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:29:00","cvss-vector":"AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N","cwe":"CWE-93","id":"CVE-2017-7528","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:29:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105143","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2017-7528"],"refmap":{"bid":["105143"],"confirm":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2017-7528"]},"summary":"Ansible Tower as shipped with Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine 5 is vulnerable to CRLF Injection.
