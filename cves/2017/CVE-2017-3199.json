Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2020-02-06T15:02:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2017-3199","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-02-06T15:02:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97382","http://www.securityweek.com/flaws-java-amf-libraries-allow-remote-code-execution","https://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2017/04/amf.html","https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/307983"],"refmap":{"bid":["97382"],"cert-vn":["VU#307983"],"misc":["http://www.securityweek.com/flaws-java-amf-libraries-allow-remote-code-execution","https://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2017/04/amf.html"]},"summary":"The Java implementation of GraniteDS, version 3.1.1.GA, AMF3 deserializers derives class instances from java.io.Externalizable rather than the AMF3 specification's recommendation of flash.utils.IExternalizable.
