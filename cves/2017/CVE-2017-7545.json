If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:29:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-7545","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:29:00","redhat":{"advisories":[{"rhsa":{"id":"RHSA-2017:3354"}},{"rhsa":{"id":"RHSA-2017:3355"}}]},"references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102179","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3354","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2017:3355","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2017-7545","https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm-designer/commit/a143f3b92a6a5a527d929d68c02a0c5d914ab81d"],"refmap":{"bid":["102179"],"confirm":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2017-7545","https://github.com/kiegroup/jbpm-designer/commit/a143f3b92a6a5a527d929d68c02a0c5d914ab81d"]},"summary":"It was discovered that the XmlUtils class in jbpmmigration 6.5 performed expansion of external parameter entities while parsing XML files.
