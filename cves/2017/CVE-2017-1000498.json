If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2020-01-30T18:04:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-1000498","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-01-30T18:04:00","references":["https://github.com/BigBadaboom/androidsvg/issues/122"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://github.com/BigBadaboom/androidsvg/issues/122"]},"summary":"AndroidSVG version 1.2.2 is vulnerable to XXE attacks in the SVG parsing component resulting in denial of service and possibly remote code execution","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:androidsvg_project:androidsvg:1.2.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:androidsvg_project:androidsvg:1.2.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:androidsvg_project:androidsvg:1.2.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
