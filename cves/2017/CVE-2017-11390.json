If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2017-08-04T01:29:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-11390","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2017-08-04T01:29:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100078","http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-17-501","https://success.trendmicro.com/solution/1117722"],"refmap":{"bid":["100078"],"misc":["http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-17-501","https://success.trendmicro.com/solution/1117722"]},"summary":"XML external entity (XXE) processing vulnerability in Trend Micro Control Manager 6.0, if exploited, could lead to information disclosure.
