The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":4.6,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:22:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2017-12252","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:22:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/100923","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170920-findit"],"refmap":{"bid":["100923"],"confirm":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170920-findit"]},"summary":"A vulnerability in the Cisco FindIT Network Discovery Utility could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform a DLL preloading attack, potentially causing a partial impact to device availability, confidentiality, and integrity. The vulnerability is due to the application loading a malicious copy of a specific, nondefined DLL file instead of the DLL file it was expecting. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing an affected DLL within the search path of the host system. An exploit could allow the attacker to load a malicious DLL file into the system, thus partially compromising confidentiality, integrity, and availability on the device.
