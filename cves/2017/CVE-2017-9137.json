This account can be accessed via both the web interface and SSH. In the web interface, this simply grants an attacker read-only access to the device's settings. However, when using SSH, this gives an attacker access to a Linux shell. NOTE: the vendor has commented \"The mateidu user is a known user, which is mentioned in the FibeAir IP-10 User Guide. Customers are instructed to change the mateidu user password. Changing the user password fully solves the vulnerability.\"","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:ceragon:fiberair_ip-10_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:ceragon:fiberair_ip-10_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:ceragon:fiberair_ip-10_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
