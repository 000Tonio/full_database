If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":3.3,"cvss-time":"2017-07-08T01:29:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-7907","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2017-07-08T01:29:00","references":["http://software.schneider-electric.com/pdf/security-bulletin/lfsec00000120/","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98254","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038542","https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-17-122-01"],"refmap":{"bid":["98254"],"misc":["http://software.schneider-electric.com/pdf/security-bulletin/lfsec00000120/","https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-17-122-01"],"sectrack":["1038542"]},"summary":"An Improper XML Parser Configuration issue was discovered in Schneider Electric Wonderware Historian Client 2014 R2 SP1 and prior.
