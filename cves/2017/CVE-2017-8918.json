If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2017-09-21T18:46:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-8918","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2017-09-21T18:46:00","references":["https://thenopsled.com/Exploit-DB%20Writeup.txt"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://thenopsled.com/Exploit-DB%20Writeup.txt"]},"summary":"XXE in Dive Assistant - Template Builder in Blackwave Dive Assistant - Desktop Edition 8.0 allows attackers to remotely view local files via a crafted template.xml file.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blackwave:dive_assistant:8.0:*:*:*:desktop:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blackwave:dive_assistant:8.0:*:*:*:desktop:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:blackwave:dive_assistant:8.0:*:*:*:desktop:*:*:*"]}
