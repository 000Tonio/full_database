If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2017-11-08T13:50:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-15639","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2017-11-08T13:50:00","references":["http://www.getmura.com/blog/critical-security-update-for-mura-cms-version-6-1-and-earlier/","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101603","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43045/"],"refmap":{"bid":["101603"],"confirm":["http://www.getmura.com/blog/critical-security-update-for-mura-cms-version-6-1-and-earlier/"],"exploit-db":["43045"]},"summary":"tasks/feed/readRSS.cfm in Mura CMS before 6.2 allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the \"draggable feeds\" feature.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:getmura:mura_cms:6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:getmura:mura_cms:6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:getmura:mura_cms:6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
