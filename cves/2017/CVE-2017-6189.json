The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":4.4,"cvss-time":"2017-03-24T14:07:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2017-6189","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2017-03-24T14:07:00","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/141366/Amazon-Kindle-DLL-Hijacking.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Feb/71","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96476"],"refmap":{"bid":["96476"],"fulldisc":["20170228 CVE-2017-6189-Amazon Kindle for Windows"],"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/141366/Amazon-Kindle-DLL-Hijacking.html"]},"summary":"Untrusted search path vulnerability in Amazon Kindle for PC before 1.19 allows local users to execute arbitrary code and conduct DLL hijacking attacks via a Trojan horse DLL in the current working directory of the Kindle Setup installer.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:amazon:kindle_for_pc:1.3.0.30884:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:amazon:kindle_for_pc:1.3.0.30884:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:amazon:kindle_for_pc:1.3.0.30884:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
