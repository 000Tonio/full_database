This denial of service attack requires substantially fewer packets to be sent which makes DoS harder to detect. This is an equivalent of SYN flood in HTTP. The idea is to keep the HTTP session alive indefinitely and then repeat that hundreds of times. This attack targets resource depletion weaknesses in web server software. The web server will wait to attacker's responses on the initiated HTTP sessions while the connection threads are being exhausted."}],"cvss":5.2,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:22:00","cvss-vector":"AV:A/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:C","cwe":"CWE-772","id":"CVE-2017-12278","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:22:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101642","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039712","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171101-wlc1"],"refmap":{"bid":["101642"],"confirm":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20171101-wlc1"],"sectrack":["1039712"]},"summary":"A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) subsystem of Cisco Wireless LAN Controllers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to restart, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a memory leak that occurs on an affected device after the device fails to deallocate a buffer that is used when certain MIBs are polled. An attacker who knows the SNMP Version 2 SNMP Read string or has valid SNMP Version 3 credentials for an affected device could repeatedly poll the affected MIB object IDs (OIDs) and consume available memory on the device. When memory is sufficiently depleted on the device, the device will restart, resulting in a DoS condition.
