If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2017-04-27T19:45:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-8056","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2017-04-27T19:45:00","references":["http://watchguardsupport.force.com/publicKB?type=KBSecurityIssues&SFDCID=kA62A0000000KlBSAU","https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/142177/watchguardfbxtm-xxeinject.txt","https://www.sidertia.com/Home/Community/Blog/2017/04/17/Fixed-the-Fireware-Vulnerabilities-discovered-by-Sidertia","https://www.watchguard.com/support/release-notes/fireware/11/en-US/EN_ReleaseNotes_Fireware_11_12_2/index.html"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://watchguardsupport.force.com/publicKB?type=KBSecurityIssues&SFDCID=kA62A0000000KlBSAU","https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/142177/watchguardfbxtm-xxeinject.txt","https://www.sidertia.com/Home/Community/Blog/2017/04/17/Fixed-the-Fireware-Vulnerabilities-discovered-by-Sidertia","https://www.watchguard.com/support/release-notes/fireware/11/en-US/EN_ReleaseNotes_Fireware_11_12_2/index.html"]},"summary":"WatchGuard Fireware v11.12.1 and earlier mishandles requests referring to an XML External Entity (XXE), in the XML-RPC agent. This causes the Firebox wgagent process to crash. This process crash ends all authenticated sessions to the Firebox, including management connections, and prevents new authenticated sessions until the process has recovered. The Firebox may also experience an overall degradation in performance while the wgagent process recovers. An attacker could continuously send XML-RPC requests that contain references to external entities to perform a limited Denial of Service (DoS) attack against an affected Firebox.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:watchguard:fireware:11.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:watchguard:fireware:11.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:watchguard:fireware:11.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:watchguard:fireware:11.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:watchguard:fireware:11.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:watchguard:fireware:11.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
