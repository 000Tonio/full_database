Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2018-10-02T14:28:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2017-10934","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-10-02T14:28:00","references":["http://support.zte.com.cn/support/news/LoopholeInfoDetail.aspx?newsId=1008682"],"refmap":{"confirm":["http://support.zte.com.cn/support/news/LoopholeInfoDetail.aspx?newsId=1008682"]},"summary":"All versions prior to V5.09.02.02T4 of the ZTE ZXIPTV-EPG product use the Java RMI service in which the servers use the Apache Commons Collections (ACC) library that may result in Java deserialization vulnerabilities.
