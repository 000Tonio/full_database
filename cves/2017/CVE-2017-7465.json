If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2023-02-12T23:30:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-7465","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2023-02-12T23:30:00","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2017-7465","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97605"],"refmap":{"bid":["97605"],"confirm":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2017-7465"]},"summary":"It was found that the JAXP implementation used in JBoss EAP 7.0 for XSLT processing is vulnerable to code injection. An attacker could use this flaw to cause remote code execution if they are able to provide XSLT content for parsing. Doing a transform in JAXP requires the use of a 'javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory'.
