If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2023-02-09T16:14:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-12621","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2023-02-09T16:14:00","references":["https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/f1fc3f2c45264af44ce782d54b5908ac95f02bf7ad88bb57bfb04b73@%3Cdev.commons.apache.org%3E","https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JELLY-293","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1039444","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/101052"],"refmap":{"bid":["101052"],"confirm":["https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JELLY-293"],"mlist":["[dev] 20170927 [SECURITY] CVE-2017-12621 Apache Commons Jelly connects to URL with custom doctype definitions."],"sectrack":["1039444"]},"summary":"During Jelly (xml) file parsing with Apache Xerces, if a custom doctype entity is declared with a \"SYSTEM\" entity with a URL and that entity is used in the body of the Jelly file, during parser instantiation the parser will attempt to connect to said URL.
