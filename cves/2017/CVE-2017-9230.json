This violates the security assumptions of (1) the choice of input, outside of the dedicated nonce area, fed into the Proof-of-Work function should not change its difficulty to evaluate and (2) every Proof-of-Work function execution should be independent. NOTE: a number of persons feel that this methodology is a benign mining optimization, not a vulnerability.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:bitcoin:bitcoin:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:bitcoin:bitcoin:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:bitcoin:bitcoin:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
