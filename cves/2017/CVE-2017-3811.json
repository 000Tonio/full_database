If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2017-07-12T01:29:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-3811","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2017-07-12T01:29:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96912","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1038042","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170315-wms"],"refmap":{"bid":["96912"],"confirm":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20170315-wms"],"sectrack":["1038042"]},"summary":"An XML External Entity vulnerability in Cisco WebEx Meetings Server could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to have read access to part of the information stored in the affected system.
