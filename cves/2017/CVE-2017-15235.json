The adversary must be able to control the path that is requested of the target. The administrator must have failed to properly configure an ACL or has associated an overly permissive ACL with a particular directory.

One common method of triggering directory contents as output is to construct a request containing a path that terminates in a directory name rather than a file name since many applications are configured to provide a list of the directory's contents when such a request is received. An adversary can use this to explore the directory tree on a target as well as learn the names of files. This can often end up revealing test files, backup files, temporary files, hidden files, configuration files, user accounts, script contents, as well as naming conventions, all of which can be used by an attacker to mount additional attacks."},{"id":"87","name":"Forceful Browsing","prerequisites":"The forcibly browseable pages or accessible resources must be discoverable and improperly protected.","related_weakness":["285","425","693"],"solutions":"Authenticate request to every resource. In addition, every page or resource must ensure that the request it is handling has been made in an authorized context. Forceful browsing can also be made difficult to a large extent by not hard-coding names of application pages or resources. This way, the attacker cannot figure out, from the application alone, the resources available from the present context.","summary":"An attacker employs forceful browsing to access portions of a website that are otherwise unreachable through direct URL entry. Usually, a front controller or similar design pattern is employed to protect access to portions of a web application. Forceful browsing enables an attacker to access information, perform privileged operations and otherwise reach sections of the web application that have been improperly protected."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2020-08-29T22:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-425","id":"CVE-2017-15235","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-08-29T22:15:00","references":["https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3454","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/08/msg00050.html"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://blogs.securiteam.com/index.php/archives/3454"],"mlist":["[debian-lts-announce] 20200829 [SECURITY] [DLA 2352-1] php-horde-gollem security update"]},"summary":"The File Manager (gollem) module 3.0.11 in Horde Groupware 5.2.21 allows remote attackers to bypass Horde authentication for file downloads via a crafted fn parameter that corresponds to the exact filename.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:horde:groupware:5.2.21:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:horde:groupware:5.2.21:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:horde:groupware:5.2.21:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
