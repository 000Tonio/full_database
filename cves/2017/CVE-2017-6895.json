If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2017-03-28T14:47:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-6895","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2017-03-28T14:47:00","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/141652/USB-Pratirodh-XXE-Injection.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Mar/42","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96936","https://secur1tyadvisory.wordpress.com/2017/03/15/usb-pratirodh-xml-external-entity-injection-vulnerability/"],"refmap":{"bid":["96936"],"fulldisc":["20170316 USB Pratirodh XML External Entity Injection Vulnerability"],"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/141652/USB-Pratirodh-XXE-Injection.html","https://secur1tyadvisory.wordpress.com/2017/03/15/usb-pratirodh-xml-external-entity-injection-vulnerability/"]},"summary":"USB Pratirodh allows remote attackers to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks via XML data in usb.xml.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:usb_pratirodh_project:usb_pratirodh:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:usb_pratirodh_project:usb_pratirodh:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:usb_pratirodh_project:usb_pratirodh:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
