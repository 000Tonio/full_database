If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2021-04-20T19:36:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-11457","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-04-20T19:36:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97572","https://erpscan.io/advisories/erpscan-17-018-sap-netweaver-java-7-5-xxe-com-sap-km-cm-ice/"],"refmap":{"bid":["97572"],"misc":["https://erpscan.io/advisories/erpscan-17-018-sap-netweaver-java-7-5-xxe-com-sap-km-cm-ice/"]},"summary":"XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in com.sap.km.cm.ice in SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA 7.5 allows remote authenticated users to read arbitrary files or conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks via a crafted DTD in an XML request, aka SAP Security Note 2387249.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver_application_server_java:7.50:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver_application_server_java:7.50:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver_application_server_java:7.50:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
