If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-20151","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-01-09T17:50:00","references":["https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.217054","https://vuldb.com/?id.217054","https://github.com/itext/rups/commit/ac5590925874ef810018a6b60fec216eee54fb32"],"summary":"A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in iText RUPS.
