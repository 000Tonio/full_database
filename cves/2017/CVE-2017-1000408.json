This denial of service attack requires substantially fewer packets to be sent which makes DoS harder to detect. This is an equivalent of SYN flood in HTTP. The idea is to keep the HTTP session alive indefinitely and then repeat that hundreds of times. This attack targets resource depletion weaknesses in web server software. The web server will wait to attacker's responses on the initiated HTTP sessions while the connection threads are being exhausted."}],"cvss":7.2,"cvss-time":"2019-10-03T00:03:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-772","id":"CVE-2017-1000408","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-03T00:03:00","references":["http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2017/q4/385","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/06/27/7","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/06/28/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/06/28/2","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190404-0003/","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43331/"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20190404-0003/"],"exploit-db":["43331"],"mlist":["[oss-security] 20171211 Qualys Security Advisory - Buffer overflow in glibc's ld.so","[oss-security] 20190627 Re: linux-distros membership application - Microsoft","[oss-security] 20190628 Re: linux-distros membership application - Microsoft"]},"summary":"A memory leak in glibc 2.1.1 (released on May 24, 1999) can be reached and amplified through the LD_HWCAP_MASK environment variable.
