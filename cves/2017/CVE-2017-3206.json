If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:27:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-3206","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:27:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97380","http://www.securityweek.com/flaws-java-amf-libraries-allow-remote-code-execution","https://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2017/04/amf.html","https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/307983"],"refmap":{"bid":["97380"],"cert-vn":["VU#307983"],"misc":["http://www.securityweek.com/flaws-java-amf-libraries-allow-remote-code-execution","https://codewhitesec.blogspot.com/2017/04/amf.html"]},"summary":"The Java implementation of AMF3 deserializers used by Flamingo amf-serializer by Exadel, version 2.2.0, allows external entity references (XXEs) from XML documents embedded within AMF3 messages.
