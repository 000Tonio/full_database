This denial of service attack requires substantially fewer packets to be sent which makes DoS harder to detect. This is an equivalent of SYN flood in HTTP. The idea is to keep the HTTP session alive indefinitely and then repeat that hundreds of times. This attack targets resource depletion weaknesses in web server software. The web server will wait to attacker's responses on the initiated HTTP sessions while the connection threads are being exhausted."}],"cvss":2.1,"cvss-time":"2019-10-03T00:03:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-772","id":"CVE-2017-15824","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-03T00:03:00","references":["https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/pixel/2018-06-01#qualcomm-components"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/pixel/2018-06-01#qualcomm-components"]},"summary":"In Android releases from CAF using the linux kernel (Android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, QRD Android) before security patch level 2018-06-05, the function UpdateDeviceStatus() writes a local stack buffer without initialization to flash memory using WriteToPartition() which may potentially leak memory.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:google:android:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:google:android:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:google:android:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
