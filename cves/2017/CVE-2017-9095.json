If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2017-12-02T02:29:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-9095","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2017-12-02T02:29:00","references":["https://thenopsled.com/divinglog.txt","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43187/"],"refmap":{"exploit-db":["43187"],"misc":["https://thenopsled.com/divinglog.txt"]},"summary":"XXE in Diving Log 6.0 allows attackers to remotely view local files through a crafted dive.xml file that is mishandled during a Subsurface import.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:divinglog:diving_log:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:divinglog:diving_log:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:divinglog:diving_log:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
