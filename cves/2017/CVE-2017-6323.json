If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5.2,"cvss-time":"2018-05-23T14:38:00","cvss-vector":"AV:A/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-6323","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-05-23T14:38:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98621","https://www.symantec.com/security_response/securityupdates/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=&suid=20170628_00"],"refmap":{"bid":["98621"],"confirm":["https://www.symantec.com/security_response/securityupdates/detail.jsp?fid=security_advisory&pvid=security_advisory&year=&suid=20170628_00"]},"summary":"The Symantec Management Console prior to ITMS 8.1 RU1, ITMS 8.0_POST_HF6, and ITMS 7.6_POST_HF7 has an issue whereby XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser.
