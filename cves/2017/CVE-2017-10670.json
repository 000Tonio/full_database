If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2017-07-06T17:59:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2017-10670","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2017-07-06T17:59:00","references":["http://blog.sec-consult.com/2017/06/german-e-government-details-vulnerabilities.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Jun/44"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Jun/44"]},"summary":"An XML External Entity (XXE) issue exists in OSCI-Transport 1.2 as used in OSCI Transport Library 1.6.1 (Java) and OSCI Transport Library 1.6 (.NET), exploitable by sending a crafted standard-conforming OSCI message from within the infrastructure.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:xoev:osci_transport_library:1.6:*:*:*:.net:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:xoev:osci_transport_library:1.6:*:*:*:.net:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:xoev:osci_transport_library:1.6.1:*:*:*:java:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:xoev:osci_transport_library:1.6.1:*:*:*:java:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:xoev:osci_transport_library:1.6:*:*:*:.net:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:xoev:osci_transport_library:1.6.1:*:*:*:java:*:*:*"]}
