The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute.

Exploitation of this preferential search order can allow an attacker to make the loading process load the adversary's rogue library rather than the legitimate library. This attack can be leveraged with many different libraries and with many different loading processes.

One perspective on this issue is that (1) these products do not use the Protected Processes feature, and therefore an attacker can enter an arbitrary Application Verifier Provider DLL under Image File Execution Options in the registry; (2) the self-protection mechanism is intended to block all local processes (regardless of privileges) from modifying Image File Execution Options for these products; and (3) this mechanism can be bypassed by an attacker who temporarily renames Image File Execution Options during the attack.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:avira:free_security_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:avira:free_security_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:avira:internet_security_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:avira:internet_security_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:avira:optimization_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:avira:optimization_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:avira:total_security_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:avira:total_security_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:avira:free_security_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:avira:internet_security_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:avira:optimization_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:avira:total_security_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
