If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2018-10-18T17:46:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-13415","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-10-18T17:46:00","references":["http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/Aug/1","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45146/"],"refmap":{"exploit-db":["45146"],"fulldisc":["20180802 (CVE-2018-13415) Out-of-Band XXE in Plex Media Server"]},"summary":"In Plex Media Server 1.13.2.5154, the XML parsing engine for SSDP/UPnP functionality is vulnerable to an XML External Entity Processing (XXE) attack.
