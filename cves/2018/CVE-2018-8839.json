This can cause the buffer to be overwritten, which may allow arbitrary code execution or cause the application to crash. CVSS v3 base score: 7.1; CVSS vector string: AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H. Delta Electronics recommends affected users update to at least PMSoft v2.11, which was made available as of March 22, 2018, or the latest available version.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:deltaww:pmsoft:2.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:deltaww:pmsoft:2.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:deltaww:pmsoft:2.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
