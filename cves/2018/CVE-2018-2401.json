If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:40:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-2401","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:40:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103374","https://blogs.sap.com/2018/03/13/sap-security-patch-day-march-2018/","https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2596766"],"refmap":{"bid":["103374"],"confirm":["https://blogs.sap.com/2018/03/13/sap-security-patch-day-march-2018/","https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2596766"]},"summary":"SAP Business Process Automation (BPA) By Redwood does not sufficiently validate an XML document accepted from an untrusted source resulting in an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:redwood:sap_business_process_automation:9.00:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:redwood:sap_business_process_automation:9.00:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:redwood:sap_business_process_automation:9.00:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
