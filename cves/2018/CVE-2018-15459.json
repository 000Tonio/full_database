The vulnerability is due to improper controls on certain pages in the web interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device with an administrator account and sending a crafted HTTP request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create additional Admin accounts with different user roles. An attacker could then use these accounts to perform actions within their scope. The attacker would need valid Admin credentials for the device. This vulnerability cannot be exploited to add a Super Admin account.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.3\\(0.298\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.3\\(0.298\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.5\\(0.1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.5\\(0.1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.3\\(0.298\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.5\\(0.1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
