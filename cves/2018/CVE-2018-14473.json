If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.4,"cvss-time":"2018-10-01T01:54:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-14473","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2018-10-01T01:54:00","references":["https://www.tarlogic.com/en/blog/vulnerabilities-in-ocs-inventory-2-4-1/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.tarlogic.com/en/blog/vulnerabilities-in-ocs-inventory-2-4-1/"]},"summary":"OCS Inventory 2.4.1 lacks a proper XML parsing configuration, allowing the use of external entities.
