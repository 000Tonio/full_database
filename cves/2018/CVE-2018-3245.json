Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2019-10-03T00:03:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2018-3245","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-10-03T00:03:00","references":["http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2018-4428296.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105613","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041896","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46513/"],"refmap":{"bid":["105613"],"confirm":["http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2018-4428296.html"],"exploit-db":["46513"],"sectrack":["1041896"]},"summary":"Vulnerability in the Oracle WebLogic Server component of Oracle Fusion Middleware (subcomponent: WLS Core Components).
