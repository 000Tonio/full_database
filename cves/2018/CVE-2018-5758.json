If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2018-04-10T18:49:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-5758","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2018-04-10T18:49:00","references":["https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/research/xml-external-entity-injection-xxe-cve-2018-5758/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://rhinosecuritylabs.com/research/xml-external-entity-injection-xxe-cve-2018-5758/"]},"summary":"The Upload File functionality in upload.jspa in Aurea Jive Jive-n 9.0.2.1 On-Premises allows for an XML External Entity attack through a crafted file, allowing attackers to read arbitrary files.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:aurea:jive-n:9.0.2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:aurea:jive-n:9.0.2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:aurea:jive-n:9.0.2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
