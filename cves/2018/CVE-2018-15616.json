Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:35:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2018-15616","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:35:00","references":["https://downloads.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/101052865"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://downloads.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/101052865"]},"summary":"A vulnerability in the Web UI component of Avaya Aura System Platform could allow a remote, unauthenticated user to perform a targeted deserialization attack that could result in remote code execution.
