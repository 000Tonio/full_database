An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the SMB_IOC_SVCENUM IOCTL. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length, heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code under the context of the host OS. Was ZDI-CAN-4983.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:joyent:smartos:20170803:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:joyent:smartos:20170803:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:oracle:solaris:11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:oracle:solaris:11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:oracle:zfs_storage_appliance:8.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:oracle:zfs_storage_appliance:8.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:joyent:smartos:20170803:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:oracle:solaris:11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:oracle:zfs_storage_appliance:8.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
