It potentially causes an outage of third-party services that were not designed to recover from exceptions. On the client, ID token handling can cause an unhandled exception because of misinterpretation of an integer as a string, resulting in denial-of-service and then other users can no longer login/sign-in to the affected third-party service. Once this third-party service uses Google Sign-In with google-api-cpp-client, a malicious user can trigger this client/auth/oauth2_authorization.cc vulnerability by requesting the client to receive the ID token from a Google authentication server.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:google:api_c\\+\\+_client:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:google:api_c\\+\\+_client:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:google:api_c\\+\\+_client:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
