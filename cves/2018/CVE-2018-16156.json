The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":7.2,"cvss-time":"2021-03-04T20:43:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2018-16156","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2021-03-04T20:43:00","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/160832/PaperStream-IP-TWAIN-1.42.0.5685-Local-Privilege-Escalation.html","https://www.securifera.com/advisories/cve-2018-16156/"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/160832/PaperStream-IP-TWAIN-1.42.0.5685-Local-Privilege-Escalation.html","https://www.securifera.com/advisories/cve-2018-16156/"]},"summary":"In PaperStream IP (TWAIN) 1.42.0.5685 (Service Update 7), the FJTWSVIC service running with SYSTEM privilege processes unauthenticated messages received over the FjtwMkic_Fjicube_32 named pipe.

The default install does not contain this library and therefore if any DLL with that name exists in any directory listed in the PATH variable, it can be used to escalate to SYSTEM level privilege.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:fujitsu:paperstream_ip_\\(twain\\):1.42.0.5685:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:fujitsu:paperstream_ip_\\(twain\\):1.42.0.5685:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:fujitsu:paperstream_ip_\\(twain\\):1.42.0.5685:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
