If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2019-06-24T12:29:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-18406","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-06-24T12:29:00","references":["https://forum.tufin.com/support/kc/latest/","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45808","https://www.tufin.com/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://forum.tufin.com/support/kc/latest/","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45808","https://www.tufin.com/"]},"summary":"An issue was discovered in Tufin SecureTrack 18.1 with TufinOS 2.16 build 1179(Final). The Audit Report module is affected by a blind XXE vulnerability when a new Best Practices Report is saved using a special payload inside the xml input field. The XXE vulnerability is blind since the response doesn't directly display a requested file, but rather returns it inside the name data field when the report is saved. An attacker is able to view restricted operating system files. This issue affects all types of users: administrators or normal users.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:tufin:securetrack:18.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:tufin:securetrack:18.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:tufin:tufinos:2.16:build_1179:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:tufin:tufinos:2.16:build_1179:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:tufin:securetrack:18.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
