With a debug host processor A running in non-secure EL1 and a debug target processor B running in any privilege level, the debugging feature allows A to halt B and promote B to any privilege level. As a debug host, A has full control of B even if B owns a higher privilege level than A. Accordingly, A can read/write any EL3 memory/register via B. Also, with this memory access, A can execute arbitrary code in EL3.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:raspberrypi:raspberry_pi_3_model_b\\+_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:raspberrypi:raspberry_pi_3_model_b\\+_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:raspberrypi:raspberry_pi_3_model_b\\+:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:raspberrypi:raspberry_pi_3_model_b\\+:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:raspberrypi:raspberry_pi_3_model_b\\+_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
