If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:33:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-12408","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:33:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105043","http://www.tibco.com/services/support/advisories","https://www.tibco.com/support/advisories/2018/08/tibco-security-advisory-august-7-2018-tibco-activematrix-businessworks"],"refmap":{"bid":["105043"],"confirm":["https://www.tibco.com/support/advisories/2018/08/tibco-security-advisory-august-7-2018-tibco-activematrix-businessworks"],"misc":["http://www.tibco.com/services/support/advisories"]},"summary":"The BusinessWorks engine component of TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks, TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks for z/Linux, and TIBCO ActiveMatrix BusinessWorks Distribution for TIBCO Silver Fabric contains a vulnerability that may allow XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks via incoming network messages, and may disclose the contents of files accessible to a running BusinessWorks engine Affected releases are TIBCO Software Inc.
