The vulnerability is due to insufficient server-side authorization checks. An attacker who is logged in to the web-based management interface as a low-privileged user could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use the low-privileged user account to reboot or shut down the affected system.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:network_functions_virtualization_infrastructure:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:network_functions_virtualization_infrastructure:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:cisco:network_functions_virtualization_infrastructure:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
