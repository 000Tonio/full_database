Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2018-10-12T18:21:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2018-7889","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-10-12T18:21:00","references":["https://bugs.launchpad.net/calibre/+bug/1753870","https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre/commit/aeb5b036a0bf657951756688b3c72bd68b6e4a7d"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://bugs.launchpad.net/calibre/+bug/1753870","https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre/commit/aeb5b036a0bf657951756688b3c72bd68b6e4a7d"]},"summary":"gui2/viewer/bookmarkmanager.py in Calibre 3.18 calls cPickle.load on imported bookmark data, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted .pickle file, as demonstrated by Python code that contains an os.system call.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:calibre-ebook:calibre:3.18.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:calibre-ebook:calibre:3.18.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:calibre-ebook:calibre:3.18.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
