If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2018-04-04T13:25:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-6225","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2018-04-04T13:25:00","references":["https://success.trendmicro.com/solution/1119349","https://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/trend-micro-email-encryption-gateway-multiple-vulnerabilities","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44166/"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://success.trendmicro.com/solution/1119349"],"exploit-db":["44166"],"misc":["https://www.coresecurity.com/advisories/trend-micro-email-encryption-gateway-multiple-vulnerabilities"]},"summary":"An XML external entity injection (XXE) vulnerability in Trend Micro Email Encryption Gateway 5.5 could allow an authenticated user to expose a normally protected configuration script.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:trendmicro:email_encryption_gateway:5.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:trendmicro:email_encryption_gateway:5.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:trendmicro:email_encryption_gateway:5.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
