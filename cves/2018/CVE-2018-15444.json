If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4.9,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:35:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-15444","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:35:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105860","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181107-ems-xml-xxe","https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2018-36"],"refmap":{"bid":["105860"],"cisco":["20181107 Cisco Energy Management Suite XML External Entity Vulnerability"],"misc":["https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2018-36"]},"summary":"A vulnerability in the web-based user interface of Cisco Energy Management Suite Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain read and write access to information that is stored on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user of an affected system to import a crafted XML file with malicious entries, which could allow the attacker to read and write files within the affected application.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:energy_management_suite_software:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:energy_management_suite_software:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:cisco:energy_management_suite_software:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
