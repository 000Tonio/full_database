The vulnerability is present in the parsing of a network packet without proper validation of the packet. The data read by the application is not validated, and its use can lead to a null pointer dereference. The IT application is opened by a user and then listens for a connection on port 4001. An attacker can deliver an attack once the application has been opened.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:pixar:renderman:21.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:pixar:renderman:21.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:pixar:renderman:21.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
