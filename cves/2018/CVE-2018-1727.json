If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.4,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:38:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-1727","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:38:00","references":["https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/147630","https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ibm10718887"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ibm10718887"],"xf":["ibm-infosphere-cve20181727-xxe(147630)"]},"summary":"IBM InfoSphere Information Server 9.1, 11.3, 11.5, and 11.7 is vulnerable to a XML External Entity Injection (XXE) attack when processing XML data.
