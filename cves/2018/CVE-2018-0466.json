The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of specific OSPFv3 packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted OSPFv3 Link-State Advertisements (LSA) to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause an affected device to reload, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:16.2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:16.2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:16.2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
