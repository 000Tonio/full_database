Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":10,"cvss-time":"2019-06-20T18:34:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2018-15890","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2019-06-20T18:34:00","references":["https://github.com/ethereum/ethereumj","https://github.com/ethereum/ethereumj/issues/1161","https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/ethereum/ethereumj","https://github.com/ethereum/ethereumj/issues/1161","https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/"]},"summary":"An issue was discovered in EthereumJ 1.8.2.
