An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the processing of IOCTL 0x80002000 by the IRPFile.sys Antiy-AVL ATool kernel driver. The bug is caused by failure to properly validate the length of the user-supplied data, which results in a kernel stack buffer overflow. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in the context of the kernel, which could lead to privilege escalation and a failed exploit could lead to denial of service.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:antiy:anti_virus_lab_atool:1.0.0.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:antiy:anti_virus_lab_atool:1.0.0.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:antiy:anti_virus_lab_atool:1.0.0.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
