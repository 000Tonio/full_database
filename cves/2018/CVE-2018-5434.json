If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:41:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-5434","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:41:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/104454","https://www.tibco.com/support/advisories/2018/06/security-advisory-june-12-2018-tibco-runtime-agent-2018-5434"],"refmap":{"bid":["104454"],"confirm":["https://www.tibco.com/support/advisories/2018/06/security-advisory-june-12-2018-tibco-runtime-agent-2018-5434"]},"summary":"The TIBCO Designer component of TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Runtime Agent, and TIBCO Runtime Agent for z/Linux contains vulnerabilities wherein a malicious user could perform XML external entity expansion (XXE) attacks to disclose host machine information.
