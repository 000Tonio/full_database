This denial of service attack requires substantially fewer packets to be sent which makes DoS harder to detect. This is an equivalent of SYN flood in HTTP. The idea is to keep the HTTP session alive indefinitely and then repeat that hundreds of times. This attack targets resource depletion weaknesses in web server software. The web server will wait to attacker's responses on the initiated HTTP sessions while the connection threads are being exhausted."}],"cvss":6.1,"cvss-time":"2020-12-07T21:05:00","cvss-vector":"AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C","cwe":"CWE-772","id":"CVE-2018-0471","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-12-07T21:05:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105398","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041737","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180926-cdp-memleak"],"refmap":{"bid":["105398"],"cisco":["20180926 Cisco IOS XE Software Cisco Discovery Protocol Memory Leak Vulnerability"],"sectrack":["1041737"]},"summary":"A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) module of Cisco IOS XE Software Releases 16.6.1 and 16.6.2 could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a memory leak that may lead to a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect processing of certain CDP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending certain CDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause an affected device to continuously consume memory and eventually result in a memory allocation failure that leads to a crash, triggering a reload of the affected device.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
