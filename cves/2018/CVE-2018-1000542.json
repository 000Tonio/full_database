If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2018-08-20T12:28:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-1000542","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-08-20T12:28:00","references":["https://0dd.zone/2018/06/02/Netbeans-MMD-Plugin-XXE/","https://github.com/raydac/netbeans-mmd-plugin/issues/45"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://0dd.zone/2018/06/02/Netbeans-MMD-Plugin-XXE/","https://github.com/raydac/netbeans-mmd-plugin/issues/45"]},"summary":"netbeans-mmd-plugin version <= 1.4.3 contains a XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in MMD file import that can result in Possible information disclosure, server-side request forgery, or remote code execution.
