In the worst case, all available resources are consumed while processing the data, resulting in unavailability of the service to legitimate users. This occurs because non-editable parameters can be modified by manually editing a disabled form field within the developer options.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:newgensoft:omniflow_intelligent_business_process_suite:7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:newgensoft:omniflow_intelligent_business_process_suite:7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:newgensoft:omniflow_intelligent_business_process_suite:7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
