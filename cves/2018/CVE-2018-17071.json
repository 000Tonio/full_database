This variable is private, yet it is readable by eth.getStorageAt function. Also, attackers can purchase a ticket at a low price by directly calling the fallback function with small msg.value, because the developer set the currency unit incorrectly. Therefore, it allows attackers to always win and get rewards.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:lucky9:lucky9io:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:lucky9:lucky9io:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:lucky9:lucky9io:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
