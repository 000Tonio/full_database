Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2018-11-08T20:49:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2018-15503","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2018-11-08T20:49:00","references":["https://github.com/swoole/swoole-src/commit/4cdbce5d9bf2fe596bb6acd7d6611f9e8c253a76","https://github.com/swoole/swoole-src/issues/1882","https://x-c3ll.github.io/posts/swoole-deserialization-cve-2018-15503/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/swoole/swoole-src/commit/4cdbce5d9bf2fe596bb6acd7d6611f9e8c253a76","https://github.com/swoole/swoole-src/issues/1882","https://x-c3ll.github.io/posts/swoole-deserialization-cve-2018-15503/"]},"summary":"The unpack implementation in Swoole version 4.0.4 lacks correct size checks in the deserialization process.
