When using a code book, application error messages aren't generated in string or stack trace form, but are catalogued and replaced with a unique (often integer-based) value 'coding' for the error. Such a technique will require helpdesk and hosting personnel to use a 'code book' or similar mapping to decode application errors/logs in order to respond to them normally. Design: wrap application functionality (preferably through the underlying framework) in an output encoding scheme that obscures or cleanses error messages to prevent such attacks. Such a technique is often used in conjunction with the above 'code book' suggestion. Implementation: Obfuscate server fields of HTTP response. Implementation: Hide inner ordering of HTTP response header. Implementation: Customizing HTTP error codes such as 404 or 500. Implementation: Hide HTTP response header software information filed. Implementation: Hide cookie's software information filed. Implementation: Obfuscate database type in Database API's error message.","summary":"An attacker sends random, malformed, or otherwise unexpected messages to a target application and observes the application's log or error messages returned. Fuzzing techniques involve sending random or malformed messages to a target and monitoring the target's response. The attacker does not initially know how a target will respond to individual messages but by attempting a large number of message variants they may find a variant that trigger's desired behavior. In this attack, the purpose of the fuzzing is to observe the application's log and error messages, although fuzzing a target can also sometimes cause the target to enter an unstable state, causing a crash. By observing logs and error messages, the attacker can learn details about the configuration of the target application and might be able to cause the target to disclose sensitive information."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2019-02-07T17:34:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-532","id":"CVE-2018-15004","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-02-07T17:34:00","references":["https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/android-firmware-defcon-2018/","https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/DEFCON-26-Johnson-and-Stavrou-Vulnerable-Out-of-the-Box-An-Eval-of-Android-Carrier-Devices-WP-Updated.pdf"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/android-firmware-defcon-2018/","https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/DEFCON-26-Johnson-and-Stavrou-Vulnerable-Out-of-the-Box-An-Eval-of-Android-Carrier-Devices-WP-Updated.pdf"]},"summary":"The Coolpad Canvas device with a build fingerprint of Coolpad/cp3636a/cp3636a:7.0/NRD90M/093031423:user/release-keys contains a platform app with a package name of com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode (versionCode=24, versionName=7.0) that contains an exported service app component named com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode.MbnTestService that allows any app on the device to set certain system properties as the com.android.phone user. When an app sets the persist.service.logr.enable system property to a value of 1, an app with a package name of com.yulong.logredirect (versionCode=20160622, versionName=5.25_20160622_01) will start writing the system-wide logcat log, kernel log, and a tcpdump network traffic capture to external storage. Furthermore, on the Coolpad Canvas device, the com.android.phone app writes the destination phone number and body of the text message for outgoing text messages. A notification when logging can be avoided if the log is enabled after device startup and disabled prior to device shutdown by setting the system properties using the exported interface of the com.qualcomm.qti.modemtestmode app. Any app with the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission can access the log files.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:coolpad:canvas_firmware:7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:coolpad:canvas_firmware:7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:coolpad:canvas:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:coolpad:canvas:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:coolpad:canvas_firmware:7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
