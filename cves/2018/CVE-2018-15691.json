Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2021-04-12T14:17:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2018-15691","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-04-12T14:17:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105197","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041591","https://support.ca.com/us/product-content/recommended-reading/security-notices/ca20180829-03--security-notice-for-ca-release-automation.html","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45425/"],"refmap":{"bid":["105197"],"confirm":["https://support.ca.com/us/product-content/recommended-reading/security-notices/ca20180829-03--security-notice-for-ca-release-automation.html"],"exploit-db":["45425"],"sectrack":["1041591"]},"summary":"Insecure deserialization of a specially crafted serialized object, in CA Release Automation 6.5 and earlier, allows attackers to potentially execute arbitrary code.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:release_automation:6.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:release_automation:6.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:release_automation:6.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:release_automation:6.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:release_automation:6.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:release_automation:6.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:release_automation:6.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:release_automation:6.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:release_automation:6.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
