The emulator is used infrequently for application logic testing. It is susceptible to an attack only while running in off-line mode. This vulnerability does not exist in Triconex hardware products and therefore has no effect on the operating safety functions in a plant.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:schneider-electric:triconex_tristation_emulator:1.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:schneider-electric:triconex_tristation_emulator:1.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:schneider-electric:triconex_tristation_emulator:1.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
