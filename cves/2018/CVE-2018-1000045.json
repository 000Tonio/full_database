Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2018-03-01T19:25:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2018-1000045","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-03-01T19:25:00","references":["https://github.com/nasa/SingleDop/pull/19"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://github.com/nasa/SingleDop/pull/19"]},"summary":"NASA Singledop version v1.0 contains a CWE-502 vulnerability in NASA Singledop library (Weather data) that can result in remote code execution.
