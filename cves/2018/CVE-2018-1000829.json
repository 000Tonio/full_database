If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2019-02-07T17:06:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-1000829","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-02-07T17:06:00","references":["https://0dd.zone/2018/10/28/anyplace-XXE-MitM/","https://github.com/dmsl/anyplace/issues/263"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://0dd.zone/2018/10/28/anyplace-XXE-MitM/","https://github.com/dmsl/anyplace/issues/263"]},"summary":"Anyplace version before commit 80359b4 contains a XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in Man in the middle on map API call that can result in Disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, SSRF, port scanning.
