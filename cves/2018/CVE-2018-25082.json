If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-25082","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-03-21T20:07:00","references":["https://github.com/zwczou/weixin-python/releases/tag/v0.5.5","https://github.com/zwczou/weixin-python/commit/e54abadc777715b6dcb545c13214d1dea63df6c9","https://vuldb.com/?id.223403","https://github.com/zwczou/weixin-python/pull/30","https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.223403"],"summary":"A vulnerability was found in zwczou WeChat SDK Python 0.3.0 and classified as critical.
