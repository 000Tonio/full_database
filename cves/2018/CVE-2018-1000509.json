Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2019-10-03T00:03:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2018-1000509","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-10-03T00:03:00","references":["https://advisories.dxw.com/advisories/unserialization-redirection/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://advisories.dxw.com/advisories/unserialization-redirection/"]},"summary":"Redirection version 2.7.1 contains a Serialisation vulnerability possibly allowing ACE vulnerability in Settings page AJAX that can result in could allow admin to execute arbitrary code in some circumstances.
