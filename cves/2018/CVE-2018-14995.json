When using a code book, application error messages aren't generated in string or stack trace form, but are catalogued and replaced with a unique (often integer-based) value 'coding' for the error. Such a technique will require helpdesk and hosting personnel to use a 'code book' or similar mapping to decode application errors/logs in order to respond to them normally. Design: wrap application functionality (preferably through the underlying framework) in an output encoding scheme that obscures or cleanses error messages to prevent such attacks. Such a technique is often used in conjunction with the above 'code book' suggestion. Implementation: Obfuscate server fields of HTTP response. Implementation: Hide inner ordering of HTTP response header. Implementation: Customizing HTTP error codes such as 404 or 500. Implementation: Hide HTTP response header software information filed. Implementation: Hide cookie's software information filed. Implementation: Obfuscate database type in Database API's error message.","summary":"An attacker sends random, malformed, or otherwise unexpected messages to a target application and observes the application's log or error messages returned. Fuzzing techniques involve sending random or malformed messages to a target and monitoring the target's response. The attacker does not initially know how a target will respond to individual messages but by attempting a large number of message variants they may find a variant that trigger's desired behavior. In this attack, the purpose of the fuzzing is to observe the application's log and error messages, although fuzzing a target can also sometimes cause the target to enter an unstable state, causing a crash. By observing logs and error messages, the attacker can learn details about the configuration of the target application and might be able to cause the target to disclose sensitive information."}],"cvss":1.9,"cvss-time":"2019-02-07T17:36:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-532","id":"CVE-2018-14995","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-02-07T17:36:00","references":["https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/android-firmware-defcon-2018/","https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/DEFCON-26-Johnson-and-Stavrou-Vulnerable-Out-of-the-Box-An-Eval-of-Android-Carrier-Devices-WP-Updated.pdf"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/android-firmware-defcon-2018/","https://www.kryptowire.com/portal/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/DEFCON-26-Johnson-and-Stavrou-Vulnerable-Out-of-the-Box-An-Eval-of-Android-Carrier-Devices-WP-Updated.pdf"]},"summary":"The ZTE Blade Vantage Android device with a build fingerprint of ZTE/Z839/sweet:7.1.1/NMF26V/20180120.095344:user/release-keys, the ZTE Blade Spark Android device with a build fingerprint of ZTE/Z971/peony:7.1.1/NMF26V/20171129.143111:user/release-keys, the ZTE ZMAX Pro Android device with a build fingerprint of ZTE/P895T20/urd:6.0.1/MMB29M/20170418.114928:user/release-keys, and the ZTE ZMAX Champ Android device with a build fingerprint of ZTE/Z917VL/fortune:6.0.1/MMB29M/20170327.120922:user/release-keys contain a pre-installed platform app with a package name of com.android.modem.service (versionCode=25, versionName=7.1.1; versionCode=23, versionName=6.0.1) that exports an interface to any app on co-located on the device. Using the exported interface of the com.android.modem.service app, any app can enable and obtain certain log files (modem and logcat) without the appropriate corresponding access permissions. The modem logs contain the phone number and full text body of incoming and outgoing text messages in binary format. In addition, the modem log contains the phone numbers for both incoming and outgoing phone calls. The system-wide logcat logs (those obtained via the logcat binary) tend to contain sensitive user data. Third-party apps are prevented from directly reading the system-wide logcat logs. The capability to read from the system-wide logcat logs is only available to pre-installed system apps and platform apps. The modem log and/or logcat log, once activated, get written to external storage (SD card). An app aware of this vulnerability can enable the logs, parse them for relevant data, and exfiltrate them from the device. The modem log and logcat log are inactive by default, but a third-party app with no permissions can activate them, although the app will need to be granted the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission to access them.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:zteusa:zte_blade_vantage_firmware:7.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:zteusa:zte_blade_vantage_firmware:7.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:zteusa:zte_blade_vantage:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:zteusa:zte_blade_vantage:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:zteusa:zte_blade_spark_firmware:7.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:zteusa:zte_blade_spark_firmware:7.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:zteusa:zte_blade_spark:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:zteusa:zte_blade_spark:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:zteusa:zte_zmax_pro_firmware:6.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:zteusa:zte_zmax_pro_firmware:6.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:zteusa:zte_zmax_pro:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:zteusa:zte_zmax_pro:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:zteusa:zte_zmax_champ_firmware:6.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:zteusa:zte_zmax_champ_firmware:6.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:zteusa:zte_zmax_champ:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:zteusa:zte_zmax_champ:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:zteusa:zte_blade_vantage_firmware:7.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:zteusa:zte_blade_spark_firmware:7.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:zteusa:zte_zmax_pro_firmware:6.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:zteusa:zte_zmax_champ_firmware:6.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
