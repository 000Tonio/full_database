Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2018-1000525","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","references":["https://0dd.zone/2018/05/31/OpenPSA-Object-Injection/","https://github.com/flack/openpsa/issues/191"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://0dd.zone/2018/05/31/OpenPSA-Object-Injection/","https://github.com/flack/openpsa/issues/191"]},"summary":"openpsa contains a PHP Object Injection vulnerability in Form data passed as GET request variables that can result in Possible information disclosure and remote code execution.
