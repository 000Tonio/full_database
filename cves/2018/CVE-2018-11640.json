If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.4,"cvss-time":"2018-09-07T14:21:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-11640","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2018-09-07T14:21:00","references":["https://d3adend.org/blog/?p=1398"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://d3adend.org/blog/?p=1398"]},"summary":"XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in the web service in Dialogic PowerMedia XMS before 3.5 SU2 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files or cause a denial of service (resource consumption).","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:dialogic:powermedia_xms:3.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:dialogic:powermedia_xms:3.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:dialogic:powermedia_xms:3.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
