If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":2.1,"cvss-time":"2018-12-04T19:05:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-16252","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2018-12-04T19:05:00","references":["http://hyp3rlinx.altervista.org/advisories/FSPRO-LABS-EVENT-LOG-EXPLORER-XML-INJECTION-INFO-DISCLOSURE.txt","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/149195/FsPro-Labs-Event-Log-Explorer-4.6.1.2115-XML-Injection.html","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45319/"],"refmap":{"exploit-db":["45319"],"misc":["http://hyp3rlinx.altervista.org/advisories/FSPRO-LABS-EVENT-LOG-EXPLORER-XML-INJECTION-INFO-DISCLOSURE.txt","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/149195/FsPro-Labs-Event-Log-Explorer-4.6.1.2115-XML-Injection.html"]},"summary":"FsPro Labs Event Log Explorer 4.6.1.2115 has \".elx\" FileType XML External Entity Injection.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:fspro:event_log_explorer:4.6.1.2115:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:fspro:event_log_explorer:4.6.1.2115:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:fspro:event_log_explorer:4.6.1.2115:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
