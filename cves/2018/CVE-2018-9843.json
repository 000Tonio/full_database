Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2019-02-27T20:26:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2018-9843","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-02-27T20:26:00","references":["http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2018/Apr/18","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/541932/100/0/threaded","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040675","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44429/","https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/rt-sa-2017-014/-cyberark-password-vault-web-access-remote-code-execution"],"refmap":{"bugtraq":["20180409 [RT-SA-2017-014] CyberArk Password Vault Web Access Remote Code Execution"],"exploit-db":["44429"],"fulldisc":["20180409 [RT-SA-2017-014] CyberArk Password Vault Web Access Remote Code Execution"],"misc":["https://www.redteam-pentesting.de/en/advisories/rt-sa-2017-014/-cyberark-password-vault-web-access-remote-code-execution"],"sectrack":["1040675"]},"summary":"The REST API in CyberArk Password Vault Web Access before 9.9.5 and 10.x before 10.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a serialized .NET object in an Authorization HTTP header.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cyberark:password_vault:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cyberark:password_vault:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cyberark:password_vault:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cyberark:password_vault:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:cyberark:password_vault:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cyberark:password_vault:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
