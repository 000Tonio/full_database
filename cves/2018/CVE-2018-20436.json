There are also GET requests to other URLs on the same web server. This also affects one or more other Telegram products, such as Telegram Web-version 0.7.0. In addition, it can be interpreted as an SSRF issue. NOTE: a third party has reported that potentially unwanted behavior is caused by misconfiguration of the \"Secret chats > Preview links\" setting.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:telegram:telegram:4.9.1:*:*:*:*:android:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:telegram:telegram:4.9.1:*:*:*:*:android:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:telegram:web:0.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:telegram:web:0.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:telegram:telegram:4.9.1:*:*:*:*:android:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:telegram:web:0.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
