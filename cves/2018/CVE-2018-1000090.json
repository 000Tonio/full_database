If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.8,"cvss-time":"2018-04-13T14:37:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-1000090","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2018-04-13T14:37:00","references":["https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern/issues/1141"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/textpattern/textpattern/issues/1141"]},"summary":"textpattern version version 4.6.2 contains a XML Injection vulnerability in Import XML feature that can result in Denial of service in context to the web server by exhausting server memory resources.
