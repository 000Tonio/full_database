A specially crafted image embedded within a document can cause a length to be miscalculated and underflow. This length is then treated as unsigned and then used in a copying operation. Due to the length underflow, the application will then write outside the bounds of a stack buffer, resulting in a buffer overflow. An attacker must convince a victim to open a document in order to trigger this vulnerability.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:atlantiswordprocessor:atlantis_word_processor:3.2.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:atlantiswordprocessor:atlantis_word_processor:3.2.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:atlantiswordprocessor:atlantis_word_processor:3.2.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
