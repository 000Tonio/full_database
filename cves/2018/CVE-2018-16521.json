If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2018-12-07T19:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-16521","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-12-07T19:15:00","references":["https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-htmlformentry/pull/137","https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-htmlformentry/pull/138"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-htmlformentry/pull/137","https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-htmlformentry/pull/138"]},"summary":"An XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability exists in HTML Form Entry 3.7.0, as distributed in OpenMRS Reference Application 2.8.0.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:openmrs:html_form_entry:3.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:openmrs:html_form_entry:3.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:openmrs:reference_application:2.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:openmrs:reference_application:2.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:openmrs:html_form_entry:3.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openmrs:reference_application:2.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
