The vulnerability is due to a logic error in the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to and passing traffic through a Layer 3 interface of an affected device, if the interface is configured for MACsec MKA using EAP-TLS and is running in access-session closed mode. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass 802.1x network access controls and gain access to the network.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.9.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.9.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.9.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
