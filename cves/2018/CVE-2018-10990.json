NOTE: there is no documentation stating that the web UI's logout feature was supposed to do anything beyond removing the cookie from one instance of a web browser; a client-side logout action is often not intended to address cases where a person has made a copy of a cookie outside of a browser.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:commscope:arris_tg1682g_firmware:9.1.103j6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:commscope:arris_tg1682g_firmware:9.1.103j6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:commscope:arris_tg1682g:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:commscope:arris_tg1682g:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:commscope:arris_tg1682g_firmware:9.1.103j6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
