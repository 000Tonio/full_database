If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:36:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-17247","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:36:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106294","https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elastic-stack-6-5-2-security-update/159594","https://www.elastic.co/community/security"],"refmap":{"bid":["106294"],"confirm":["https://www.elastic.co/community/security"],"misc":["https://discuss.elastic.co/t/elastic-stack-6-5-2-security-update/159594"]},"summary":"Elasticsearch Security versions 6.5.0 and 6.5.1 contain an XXE flaw in Machine Learning's find_file_structure API.
