Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2018-12-27T17:46:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2018-18987","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-12-27T17:46:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106071","https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-18-333-01"],"refmap":{"bid":["106071"],"misc":["https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-18-333-01"]},"summary":"VT-Designer Version 2.1.7.31 is vulnerable by the program populating objects with user supplied input via a file without first checking for validity, allowing attacker supplied input to be written to known memory locations.
