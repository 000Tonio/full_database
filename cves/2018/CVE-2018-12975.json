Therefore, attackers can precompute the random number and manipulate the game (e.g., get powerful characters or get critical damages).","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cryptosaga:cryptosaga:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cryptosaga:cryptosaga:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:cryptosaga:cryptosaga:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
