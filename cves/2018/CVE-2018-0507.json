The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":9.3,"cvss-time":"2018-02-13T17:54:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2018-0507","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2018-02-13T17:54:00","references":["https://jvn.jp/en/jp/JVN26255241/index.html"],"refmap":{"jvn":["JVN#26255241"]},"summary":"Untrusted search path vulnerability in FLET'S VIRUS CLEAR Easy Setup & Application Tool ver.11 and earlier versions, FLET'S VIRUS CLEAR v6 Easy Setup & Application Tool ver.11 and earlier versions allow an attacker to gain privileges via a Trojan horse DLL in an unspecified directory.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ntt-east:flet\\'s_virus_clear_easy_setup_\\&_application_tool:11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ntt-east:flet\\'s_virus_clear_easy_setup_\\&_application_tool:11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ntt-east:flet\\'s_virus_clear_v6_easy_setup_\\&_application_tool:11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ntt-east:flet\\'s_virus_clear_v6_easy_setup_\\&_application_tool:11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:ntt-east:flet\\'s_virus_clear_easy_setup_\\&_application_tool:11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ntt-east:flet\\'s_virus_clear_v6_easy_setup_\\&_application_tool:11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
