If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:41:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-6670","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:41:00","references":["https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10236"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10236"]},"summary":"External Entity Attack vulnerability in the ePO extension in McAfee Common UI (CUI) 2.0.2 allows remote authenticated users to view confidential information via a crafted HTTP request parameter.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:common_catalog:2.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:common_catalog:2.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:common_catalog:2.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
