A successful exploit could cause the filtering process to unexpectedly reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on the device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation of S/MIME-signed emails. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious S/MIME-signed email through a targeted device. If Decryption and Verification or Public Key Harvesting is configured, the filtering process could crash due to memory corruption and restart, resulting in a DoS condition. The software could then resume processing the same S/MIME-signed email, causing the filtering process to crash and restart again. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a permanent DoS condition. This vulnerability may require manual intervention to recover the ESA.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:email_security_appliance_firmware:11.0.1-401:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:email_security_appliance_firmware:11.0.1-401:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:email_security_appliance_firmware:11.1.0-131:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:email_security_appliance_firmware:11.1.0-131:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:cisco:email_security_appliance_firmware:11.0.1-401:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:cisco:email_security_appliance_firmware:11.1.0-131:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
