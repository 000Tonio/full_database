The default security setting must be to deny access and then grant access only to those resources intended by business logic.","summary":"In applications, particularly web applications, access to functionality is mitigated by an authorization framework. This framework maps Access Control Lists (ACLs) to elements of the application's functionality; particularly URL's for web apps. In the case that the administrator failed to specify an ACL for a particular element, an attacker may be able to access it with impunity. An attacker with the ability to access functionality not properly constrained by ACLs can obtain sensitive information and possibly compromise the entire application. Such an attacker can access resources that must be available only to users at a higher privilege level, can access management sections of the application, or can run queries for data that they otherwise not supposed to."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2019-11-05T18:01:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-434","id":"CVE-2018-18930","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-11-05T18:01:00","references":["https://www.drewgreen.net/vulnerabilities-in-tightrope-media-systems-carousel/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.drewgreen.net/vulnerabilities-in-tightrope-media-systems-carousel/"]},"summary":"The Tightrope Media Carousel digital signage product 7.0.4.104 contains an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the Manage Bulletins/Upload feature, which can be leveraged to gain remote code execution. An authenticated attacker can upload a crafted ZIP file (based on an exported backup of existing \"Bulletins\") containing a malicious file. When uploaded, the system only checks for the presence of the needed files within the ZIP and, as long as the malicious file is named properly, will extract all contained files to a new directory on the system, named with a random GUID. The attacker can determine this GUID by previewing an image from the uploaded Bulletin within the web UI. Once the GUID is determined, the attacker can navigate to the malicious file and execute it. In testing, an ASPX web shell was uploaded, allowing for remote-code execution in the context of a restricted IIS user.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:trms:carousel_digital_signage:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:trms:carousel_digital_signage:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:trms:carousel_digital_signage:7.0.4.104:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:trms:carousel_digital_signage:7.0.4.104:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:trms:carousel_digital_signage:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:trms:carousel_digital_signage:7.0.4.104:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
