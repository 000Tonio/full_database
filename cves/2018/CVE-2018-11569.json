Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2019-09-06T18:03:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2018-11569","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-09-06T18:03:00","references":["https://github.com/eventum/eventum/releases/tag/v3.5.2"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/eventum/eventum/releases/tag/v3.5.2"]},"summary":"Controller/ListController.php in Eventum 3.5.0 is vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data.
