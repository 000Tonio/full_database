If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2021-03-27T02:36:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-10077","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-03-27T02:36:00","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/147253/Geist-WatchDog-Console-3.2.2-XSS-XML-Injection-Insecure-Permissions.html","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44493/"],"refmap":{"exploit-db":["44493"],"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/147253/Geist-WatchDog-Console-3.2.2-XSS-XML-Injection-Insecure-Permissions.html"]},"summary":"XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in Geist WatchDog Console 3.2.2 allows remote authenticated administrators to read arbitrary files via crafted XML data.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:vertiv:watchdog_console:3.2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:vertiv:watchdog_console:3.2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:vertiv:watchdog_console:3.2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
