If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2019-05-29T05:29:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-20433","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-05-29T05:29:00","references":["https://github.com/zhutougg/c3p0/commit/2eb0ea97f745740b18dd45e4a909112d4685f87b","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/12/msg00021.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BFIVX6HOVNLAM7W3SUAMHYRNLCVQSAWR/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MQ47OFV57Y2DAHMGA5H3JOL4WHRWRFN4/"],"refmap":{"fedora":["FEDORA-2019-063672154a","FEDORA-2019-cb14e234fc"],"misc":["https://github.com/zhutougg/c3p0/commit/2eb0ea97f745740b18dd45e4a909112d4685f87b"],"mlist":["[debian-lts-announce] 20181228 [SECURITY] [DLA 1621-1] c3p0 security update"]},"summary":"c3p0 0.9.5.2 allows XXE in extractXmlConfigFromInputStream in com/mchange/v2/c3p0/cfg/C3P0ConfigXmlUtils.java during initialization.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mchange:c3p0:0.9.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mchange:c3p0:0.9.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:mchange:c3p0:0.9.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
