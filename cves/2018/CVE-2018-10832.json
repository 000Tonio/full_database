If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2018-06-13T13:16:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-10832","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2018-06-13T13:16:00","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/147573/ModbusPal-1.6b-XML-External-Entity-Injection.html","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44607/"],"refmap":{"exploit-db":["44607"],"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/147573/ModbusPal-1.6b-XML-External-Entity-Injection.html"]},"summary":"ModbusPal 1.6b is vulnerable to an XML External Entity (XXE) attack.
