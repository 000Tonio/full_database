If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2019-01-24T19:09:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-19371","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-01-24T19:09:00","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/150826/SDL-Web-Content-Manager-8.5.0-XML-Injection.html","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46000/"],"refmap":{"exploit-db":["46000"],"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/150826/SDL-Web-Content-Manager-8.5.0-XML-Injection.html"]},"summary":"The SaveUserSettings service in Content Manager in SDL Web 8.5.0 has an XXE Vulnerability that allows reading sensitive files from the system.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sdl:web_content_manager:8.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sdl:web_content_manager:8.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sdl:web_content_manager:8.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
