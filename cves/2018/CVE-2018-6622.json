An abnormal case is not handled properly by this firmware while S3 sleep and can clear TPM 2.0. It allows local users to overwrite static PCRs of TPM and neutralize the security features of it, such as seal/unseal and remote attestation.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:trustedcomputinggroup:trusted_platform_module:2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:trustedcomputinggroup:trusted_platform_module:2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:trustedcomputinggroup:trusted_platform_module:2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
