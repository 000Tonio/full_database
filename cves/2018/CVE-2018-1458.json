The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:38:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2018-1458","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:38:00","references":["http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1041230","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/140209","https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22016624"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22016624"],"sectrack":["1041230"],"xf":["ibm-db2-cve20181458-priv-escalation(140209)"]},"summary":"IBM DB2 for Linux, UNIX and Windows (includes DB2 Connect Server) 9.7, 10,1, 10.5 and 11.1 could allow a local user to execute arbitrary code and conduct DLL hijacking attacks.
