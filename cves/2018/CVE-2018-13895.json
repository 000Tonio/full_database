Deletion of data should be completed promptly when requested.","summary":"An adversary obtains unauthorized information due to insecure or incomplete data deletion in a multi-tenant environment. If a cloud provider fails to completely delete storage and data from former cloud tenants' systems/resources, once these resources are allocated to new, potentially malicious tenants, the latter can probe the provided resources for sensitive information still there."},{"id":"502","name":"Intent Spoof","prerequisites":"An adversary must be able install a purpose built malicious application onto the Android device and convince the user to execute it. The malicious application will be used to issue spoofed intents.","related_weakness":["284"],"solutions":"To limit one's exposure to this type of attack, developers should avoid exporting components unless the component is specifically designed to handle requests from untrusted applications. Developers should be aware that declaring an intent filter will automatically export the component, exposing it to public access. Critical, state-changing actions should not be placed in exported components. If a single component handles both inter- and intra-application requests, the developer should consider dividing that component into separate components. If a component must be exported (e.g., to receive system broadcasts), then the component should dynamically check the caller's identity prior to performing any operations. Requiring Signature or SignatureOrSystem permissions is an effective way of limiting a component's exposure to a set of trusted applications. Finally, the return values of exported components can also leak private data, so developers should check the caller's identity prior to returning sensitive values.","summary":"An adversary, through a previously installed malicious application, issues an intent directed toward a specific trusted application's component in an attempt to achieve a variety of different objectives including modification of data, information disclosure, and data injection. Components that have been unintentionally exported and made public are subject to this type of an attack. If the component blindly trusts the intent's action, then the target application performs the functionality at the adversary's request, helping the adversary achieve the desired negative technical impact."},{"id":"552","name":"Install Rootkit ","prerequisites":"","related_weakness":["284"],"solutions":"Prevent adversary access to privileged accounts necessary to install rootkits.","summary":"An adversary exploits a weakness in authentication to install malware that alters the functionality and information provide by targeted operating system API calls.

Protect shared folders by minimizing users that have write access. Use utilities that mitigate exploitation like the Microsoft Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) to prevent exploits from being run.","summary":"An adversary manipulates the files in a shared location by adding malicious programs, scripts, or exploit code to valid content. Once a user opens the shared content, the tainted content is executed."},{"id":"558","name":"Replace Trusted Executable","prerequisites":"","related_weakness":["284"],"solutions":"","summary":"An adversary exploits weaknesses in privilege management or access control to replace a trusted executable with a malicious version and enable the execution of malware when that trusted executable is called."},{"id":"550","name":"Install New Service","prerequisites":"","related_weakness":["284"],"solutions":"Limit privileges of user accounts so new service creation can only be performed by authorized administrators.","summary":"When an operating system starts, it also starts programs called services or daemons. Adversaries may install a new service which will be executed at startup (on a Windows system, by modifying the registry). The service name may be disguised by using a name from a related operating system or benign software. Services are usually run with elevated privileges."},{"id":"19","name":"Embedding Scripts within Scripts","prerequisites":"Target software must be able to execute scripts, and also grant the adversary privilege to write/upload scripts.","related_weakness":["284"],"solutions":"Use browser technologies that do not allow client side scripting. Utilize strict type, character, and encoding enforcement. Server side developers should not proxy content via XHR or other means. If a HTTP proxy for remote content is setup on the server side, the client's browser has no way of discerning where the data is originating from. Ensure all content that is delivered to client is sanitized against an acceptable content specification. Perform input validation for all remote content. Perform output validation for all remote content. Disable scripting languages such as JavaScript in browser Session tokens for specific host Patching software. There are many attack vectors for XSS on the client side and the server side. Many vulnerabilities are fixed in service packs for browser, web servers, and plug in technologies, staying current on patch release that deal with XSS countermeasures mitigates this. Privileges are constrained, if a script is loaded, ensure system runs in chroot jail or other limited authority mode","summary":"An attack of this type exploits a programs' vulnerabilities that are brought on by allowing remote hosts to execute scripts. The adversary leverages this capability to execute his/her own script by embedding it within other scripts that the target software is likely to execute. The adversary must have the ability to inject their script into a script that is likely to be executed. If this is done, then the adversary can potentially launch a variety of probes and attacks against the web server's local environment, in many cases the so-called DMZ, back end resources the web server can communicate with, and other hosts. With the proliferation of intermediaries, such as Web App Firewalls, network devices, and even printers having JVMs and Web servers, there are many locales where an attacker can inject malicious scripts. Since this attack pattern defines scripts within scripts, there are likely privileges to execute said attack on the host. These attacks are not solely limited to the server side, client side scripts like Ajax and client side JavaScript can contain malicious scripts as well."},{"id":"441","name":"Malicious Logic Insertion","prerequisites":"Access to the component currently deployed at a victim location.","related_weakness":["284"],"solutions":"","summary":"An adversary installs or adds malicious logic (also known as malware) into a seemingly benign component of a fielded system. This logic is often hidden from the user of the system and works behind the scenes to achieve negative impacts. With the proliferation of mass digital storage and inexpensive multimedia devices, Bluetooth and 802.11 support, new attack vectors for spreading malware are emerging for things we once thought of as innocuous greeting cards, picture frames, or digital projectors. This pattern of attack focuses on systems already fielded and used in operation as opposed to systems and their components that are still under development and part of the supply chain."},{"id":"551","name":"Modify Existing Service","prerequisites":"","related_weakness":["284","522"],"solutions":"Limit privileges of user accounts so service changes can only be performed by authorized administrators.

If adversaries can access these scripts, they may insert additional code into the logon script. This code can allow them to maintain persistence or move laterally within an enclave because it is executed every time the affected user or users logon to a computer. Modifying logon scripts can effectively bypass workstation and enclave firewalls. Depending on the access configuration of the logon scripts, either local credentials or a remote administrative account may be necessary."},{"id":"578","name":"Disable Security Software","prerequisites":"The adversary must have the capability to interact with the configuration of the targeted system.","related_weakness":["284"],"solutions":"Ensure proper permissions are in place to prevent adversaries from altering the execution status of security tools.","summary":"An adversary exploits a weakness in access control to disable security tools so that detection does not occur. This can take the form of killing processes, deleting registry keys so that tools do not start at run time, deleting log files, or other methods."},{"id":"563","name":"Add Malicious File to Shared Webroot","prerequisites":"","related_weakness":["284"],"solutions":"Ensure proper permissions on directories that are accessible through a web server. Disallow remote access to the web root. Disable execution on directories within the web root. Ensure that permissions of the web server process are only what is required by not using built-in accounts and instead create specific accounts to limit unnecessary access or permissions overlap across multiple systems.","summary":"An adversaries may add malicious content to a website through the open file share and then browse to that content with a web browser to cause the server to execute the content. The malicious content will typically run under the context and permissions of the web server process, often resulting in local system or administrative privileges depending on how the web server is configured."},{"id":"479","name":"Malicious Root Certificate","prerequisites":"The adversary must have the ability to create a new root certificate.","related_weakness":["284"],"solutions":"","summary":"An adversary exploits a weakness in authorization and installs a new root certificate on a compromised system. Certificates are commonly used for establishing secure TLS/SSL communications within a web browser. When a user attempts to browse a website that presents a certificate that is not trusted an error message will be displayed to warn the user of the security risk. Depending on the security settings, the browser may not allow the user to establish a connection to the website. Adversaries have used this technique to avoid security warnings prompting users when compromised systems connect over HTTPS to adversary controlled web servers that spoof legitimate websites in order to collect login credentials."},{"id":"503","name":"WebView Exposure","prerequisites":"This type of an attack requires the adversary to convince the user to load the malicious web page inside the target application. Once loaded, the malicious web page will have the same permissions as the target application and will have access to all registered interfaces. Both the permission and the interface must be in place for the functionality to be exposed.","related_weakness":["284"],"solutions":"To mitigate this type of an attack, an application should limit permissions to only those required and should verify the origin of all web content it loads.","summary":"An adversary, through a malicious web page, accesses application specific functionality by leveraging interfaces registered through WebView's addJavascriptInterface API.
