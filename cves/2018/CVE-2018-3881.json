If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2023-02-03T13:56:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-3881","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2023-02-03T13:56:00","references":["https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0559"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0559"]},"summary":"An exploitable unauthenticated XML external injection vulnerability was identified in FocalScope v2416.
