The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":9.3,"cvss-time":"2018-02-15T15:41:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2018-6318","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2018-02-15T15:41:00","references":["https://29wspy.ru/exploits/CVE-2018-6318.pdf"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://29wspy.ru/exploits/CVE-2018-6318.pdf"]},"summary":"In Sophos Tester Tool 3.2.0.7 Beta, the driver loads (in the context of the application used to test an exploit or ransomware) the DLL using a payload that runs from NTDLL.DLL (so, it's run in userland), but the driver doesn't perform any validation of this DLL (not its signature, not its hash, etc.).
