This framework maps Access Control Lists (ACLs) to elements of the application's functionality; particularly URL's for web apps. In the case that the administrator failed to specify an ACL for a particular element, an attacker may be able to access it with impunity. An attacker with the ability to access functionality not properly constrained by ACLs can obtain sensitive information and possibly compromise the entire application. Such an attacker can access resources that must be available only to users at a higher privilege level, can access management sections of the application, or can run queries for data that they otherwise not supposed to."}],"cvss":7.6,"cvss-time":"2018-05-15T13:10:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-434","id":"CVE-2018-9156","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2018-05-15T13:10:00","references":["https://www.slideshare.net/secret/aewA1dZwZ9FQ8g"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.slideshare.net/secret/aewA1dZwZ9FQ8g"]},"summary":"** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered on AXIS P1354 (IP camera) Firmware version 5.90.1.1 devices. The upload web page doesn't verify the file type, and an attacker can upload a webshell by making a fileUpload.shtml request for a custom .shtml file, which is interpreted by the Apache HTTP Server mod_include module with \"<!--#exec cmd=\" support. The file needs to include a specific string to meet the internal system architecture. After the webshell upload, an attacker can use the webshell to perform remote code execution such as running a system command (ls, ping, cat /etc/passwd, etc.). NOTE: the vendor reportedly indicates that this is an intended feature or functionality.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:axis:p1354_firmware:5.90.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:axis:p1354_firmware:5.90.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:axis:p1354:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:axis:p1354:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:axis:p1354_firmware:5.90.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
