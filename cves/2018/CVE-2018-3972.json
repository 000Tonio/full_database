Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2023-02-02T13:39:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2018-3972","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2023-02-02T13:39:00","references":["https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0637","https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/09/epee-levin-vuln.html"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/09/epee-levin-vuln.html","https://www.talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2018-0637"]},"summary":"An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the Levin deserialization functionality of the Epee library, as used in Monero 'Lithium Luna' (v0.12.2.0-master-ffab6700) and other cryptocurrencies.
