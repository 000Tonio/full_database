If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2020-09-04T17:57:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-0207","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-09-04T17:57:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103343","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040470","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180307-acs"],"refmap":{"bid":["103343"],"confirm":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180307-acs"],"sectrack":["1040470"]},"summary":"A vulnerability in the web-based user interface of the Cisco Secure Access Control Server prior to 5.8 patch 9 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain read access to certain information in the affected system. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entities (XXEs) when parsing an XML file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing the administrator of an affected system to import a crafted XML file.
