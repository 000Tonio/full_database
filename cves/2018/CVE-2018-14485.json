If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2019-05-08T19:10:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-14485","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-05-08T19:10:00","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/151063/BlogEngine-3.3-XML-External-Entity-Injection.html","https://github.com/rxtur/BlogEngine.NET/commits/master","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46106/"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/151063/BlogEngine-3.3-XML-External-Entity-Injection.html","https://github.com/rxtur/BlogEngine.NET/commits/master","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46106/"]},"summary":"BlogEngine.NET 3.3 allows XXE attacks via the POST body to metaweblog.axd.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blogengine:blogengine.net:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blogengine:blogengine.net:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:blogengine:blogengine.net:3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
