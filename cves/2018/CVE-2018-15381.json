Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":10,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:35:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2018-15381","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:35:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105876","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1042130","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20181107-cue"],"refmap":{"bid":["105876"],"cisco":["20181107 Cisco Unity Express Arbitrary Command Execution Vulnerability"],"sectrack":["1042130"]},"summary":"A Java deserialization vulnerability in Cisco Unity Express (CUE) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the root user. The vulnerability is due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied content by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious serialized Java object to the listening Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) service.
