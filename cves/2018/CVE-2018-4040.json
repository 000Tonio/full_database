A specially crafted document can cause certain RTF tokens to dereference a pointer that has been uninitialized and then write to it. An attacker must convince a victim to open a specially crafted document in order to trigger this vulnerability.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:atlantiswordprocessor:atlantis_word_processor:3.2.7.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:atlantiswordprocessor:atlantis_word_processor:3.2.7.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:atlantiswordprocessor:atlantis_word_processor:3.2.7.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
