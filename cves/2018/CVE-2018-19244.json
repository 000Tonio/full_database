If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2019-02-01T02:19:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-19244","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-02-01T02:19:00","references":["https://whitehatck01.blogspot.com/2018/11/charles-427-xml-external-entity.html"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://whitehatck01.blogspot.com/2018/11/charles-427-xml-external-entity.html"]},"summary":"An XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability exists in the Charles 4.2.7 import/export setup option.
