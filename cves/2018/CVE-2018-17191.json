Using the nashorn script engine the environment of the javascript execution for the Proxy Auto-Configuration leaks privileged objects, that can be used to circumvent the execution limits. If a different script engine was used, no execution limits were in place. Both vectors allow remote code execution.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:netbeans:9.0:incubating:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:netbeans:9.0:incubating:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:apache:netbeans:9.0:incubating:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
