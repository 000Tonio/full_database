A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":8.5,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:37:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2018-18808","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:37:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107350","http://www.tibco.com/services/support/advisories","https://www.tibco.com/support/advisories/2019/03/tibco-security-advisory-march-6-2019-tibco-jasperreports-server-2018-18808"],"refmap":{"bid":["107350"],"confirm":["https://www.tibco.com/support/advisories/2019/03/tibco-security-advisory-march-6-2019-tibco-jasperreports-server-2018-18808"],"misc":["http://www.tibco.com/services/support/advisories"]},"summary":"The domain management component of TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO JasperReports Server, TIBCO JasperReports Server Community Edition, TIBCO JasperReports Server for ActiveMatrix BPM, TIBCO Jaspersoft for AWS with Multi-Tenancy, and TIBCO Jaspersoft Reporting and Analytics for AWS contains a race-condition vulnerability that may allow any users with domain save privileges to gain superuser privileges.
