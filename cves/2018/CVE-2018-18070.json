Defining or receiving a specific navigation route might cause the system to freeze and reboot after a few transmissions. When the system next starts, it tries to re-calculate the route, which will cause a boot loop. (Under certain circumstances, it is possible to quickly overwrite the malicious route to regain the stability of the system.)","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:mercedes-benz:comand:17\\/13.0_50.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:mercedes-benz:comand:17\\/13.0_50.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:mercedes-benz:c-class:2018:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:mercedes-benz:c-class:2018:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:mercedes-benz:comand:17\\/13.0_50.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
