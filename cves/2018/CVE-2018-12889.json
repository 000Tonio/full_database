There is a heap-based buffer overflow in mkAddToRelayCacheRequest and in ccnl_populate_cache for an array lacking '\\0' termination when reading a binary CCNx or NDN file. This can result in Heap Corruption. This was addressed by fixing the memory management in mkAddToRelayCacheRequest in ccn-lite-ctrl.c.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ccn-lite:ccn-lite:2.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ccn-lite:ccn-lite:2.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:ccn-lite:ccn-lite:2.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
