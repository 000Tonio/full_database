However, if the type is in fact struct ccnl_pktdetail_ccntlv_s or struct ccnl_pktdetail_iottlv_s, the memory at that point is either uninitialised or points to data that is not a nonce, which renders the code using the local variable nonce pointless. A later nonce check is insufficient.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ccn-lite:ccn-lite:2.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ccn-lite:ccn-lite:2.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:ccn-lite:ccn-lite:2.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
