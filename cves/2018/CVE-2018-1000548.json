If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2018-08-20T12:55:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-1000548","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-08-20T12:55:00","references":["http://0dd.zone/2018/04/23/UMLet-XXE/","https://github.com/umlet/umlet/issues/500"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://0dd.zone/2018/04/23/UMLet-XXE/","https://github.com/umlet/umlet/issues/500"]},"summary":"Umlet version < 14.3 contains a XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in File parsing that can result in disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, server side request forgery.
