This framework maps Access Control Lists (ACLs) to elements of the application's functionality; particularly URL's for web apps. In the case that the administrator failed to specify an ACL for a particular element, an attacker may be able to access it with impunity. An attacker with the ability to access functionality not properly constrained by ACLs can obtain sensitive information and possibly compromise the entire application. Such an attacker can access resources that must be available only to users at a higher privilege level, can access management sections of the application, or can run queries for data that they otherwise not supposed to."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2018-10-10T13:06:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-434","id":"CVE-2018-14028","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-10-10T13:06:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105060","https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44710","https://github.com/rastating/wordpress-exploit-framework/pull/52","https://rastating.github.io/unrestricted-file-upload-via-plugin-uploader-in-wordpress/"],"refmap":{"bid":["105060"],"misc":["https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44710","https://github.com/rastating/wordpress-exploit-framework/pull/52","https://rastating.github.io/unrestricted-file-upload-via-plugin-uploader-in-wordpress/"]},"summary":"In WordPress 4.9.7, plugins uploaded via the admin area are not verified as being ZIP files. This allows for PHP files to be uploaded. Once a PHP file is uploaded, the plugin extraction fails, but the PHP file remains in a predictable wp-content/uploads location, allowing for an attacker to then execute the file. This represents a security risk in limited scenarios where an attacker (who does have the required capabilities for plugin uploads) cannot simply place arbitrary PHP code into a valid plugin ZIP file and upload that plugin, because a machine's wp-content/plugins directory permissions were set up to block all new plugins.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:wordpress:wordpress:4.9.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:wordpress:wordpress:4.9.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:wordpress:wordpress:4.9.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
