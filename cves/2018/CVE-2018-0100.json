If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":3.6,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:31:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-0100","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:31:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102738","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040246","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180117-acpe"],"refmap":{"bid":["102738"],"confirm":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180117-acpe"],"sectrack":["1040246"]},"summary":"A vulnerability in the Profile Editor of the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to have read and write access to information stored in the affected system. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of the XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing an XML file. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting a crafted XML file with malicious entries, which could allow the attacker to read and write files.
