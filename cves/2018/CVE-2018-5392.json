ASLR is an exploit mitigation technique used by modern Windows platforms. For ASLR to function, Windows executables must contain a relocations table. Despite containing the \"Dynamic base\" PE header, which indicates ASLR compatibility, Windows executables produced by mingw-w64 have the relocations table stripped from them by default. This means that executables produced by mingw-w64 are vulnerable to return-oriented programming (ROP) attacks. Windows executables generated by mingw-w64 claim to be ASLR compatible, but are not. Vulnerabilities in such executables are more easily exploitable as a result.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mingw:mingw-w64:5.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mingw:mingw-w64:5.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:mingw:mingw-w64:5.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
