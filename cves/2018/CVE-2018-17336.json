Most applications assume that users will provide static text and may respond unpredictably to the presence of formatting character. For example, in certain functions of the C programming languages such as printf, the formatting character %s will print the contents of a memory location expecting this location to identify a string and the formatting character %n prints the number of DWORD written in the memory. An adversary can use this to read or write to memory locations or files, or simply to manipulate the value of the resulting text in unexpected ways. Reading or writing memory may result in program crashes and writing memory could result in the execution of arbitrary code if the adversary can write to the program stack."}],"cvss":4.6,"cvss-time":"2019-08-06T17:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-134","id":"CVE-2018-17336","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-08-06T17:15:00","redhat":{"advisories":[{"bugzilla":{"id":"1672664","title":"Package udisks2-lsm (libstoragemgmt modules for udisks2)"},"oval":{"OR":[{"comment":"Red Hat Enterprise Linux must be installed","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhba:tst:20070304026"},{"AND":[{"comment":"Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is installed","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhba:tst:20150364027"},{"OR":[{"AND":[{"comment":"libudisks2 is earlier than 0:2.7.3-9.el7","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20192178001"},{"comment":"libudisks2 is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease2 key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20192178002"}]},{"AND":[{"comment":"libudisks2-devel is earlier than 0:2.7.3-9.el7","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20192178003"},{"comment":"libudisks2-devel is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease2 key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20192178004"}]},{"AND":[{"comment":"udisks2 is earlier than 0:2.7.3-9.el7","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20192178005"},{"comment":"udisks2 is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease2 key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20192178006"}]},{"AND":[{"comment":"udisks2-iscsi is earlier than 0:2.7.3-9.el7","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20192178007"},{"comment":"udisks2-iscsi is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease2 key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20192178008"}]},{"AND":[{"comment":"udisks2-lsm is earlier than 0:2.7.3-9.el7","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20192178009"},{"comment":"udisks2-lsm is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease2 key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20192178010"}]},{"AND":[{"comment":"udisks2-lvm2 is earlier than 0:2.7.3-9.el7","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20192178011"},{"comment":"udisks2-lvm2 is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease2 key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20192178012"}]}]}]}]},"rhsa":{"id":"RHSA-2019:2178","released":"2019-08-06","severity":"Moderate","title":"RHSA-2019:2178: udisks2 security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Moderate)"}}],"rpms":["libudisks2-0:2.7.3-9.el7","libudisks2-devel-0:2.7.3-9.el7","udisks2-0:2.7.3-9.el7","udisks2-debuginfo-0:2.7.3-9.el7","udisks2-iscsi-0:2.7.3-9.el7","udisks2-lsm-0:2.7.3-9.el7","udisks2-lvm2-0:2.7.3-9.el7"]},"references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2019:2178","https://github.com/storaged-project/udisks/issues/578","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3772-1/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/storaged-project/udisks/issues/578"],"ubuntu":["USN-3772-1"]},"summary":"UDisks 2.8.0 has a format string vulnerability in udisks_log in udiskslogging.c, allowing attackers to obtain sensitive information (stack contents), cause a denial of service (memory corruption), or possibly have unspecified other impact via a malformed filesystem label, as demonstrated by %d or %n substrings.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:freedesktop:udisks:2.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:freedesktop:udisks:2.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:18.04:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:18.04:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:freedesktop:udisks:2.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:canonical:ubuntu_linux:18.04:*:*:*:lts:*:*:*"]}
