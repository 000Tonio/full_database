Modifying the read-only properties by an app as the system user creates a UNIX domain socket named factory_test that will execute commands as the root user by processes that have privilege to access it (as per the SELinux rules that the vendor controls).","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:alcatel:a30_firmware:7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:alcatel:a30_firmware:7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:alcatel:a30:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:alcatel:a30:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:alcatel:a30_firmware:7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
