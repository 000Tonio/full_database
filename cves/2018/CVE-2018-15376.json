The vulnerability is due to the presence of certain test commands that were intended to be available only in internal development builds of the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using these commands on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to write arbitrary values to arbitrary locations in the memory space of the affected device.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.5\\(2.21\\)t:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.5\\(2.21\\)t:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.6\\(3\\)m:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.6\\(3\\)m:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.5\\(2.21\\)t:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.6\\(3\\)m:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
