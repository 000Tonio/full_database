Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":9.3,"cvss-time":"2018-05-22T16:01:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2018-1000167","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2018-05-22T16:01:00","references":["https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/2359","https://tech.feedyourhead.at/content/remote-code-execution-in-suricata-update"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://redmine.openinfosecfoundation.org/issues/2359","https://tech.feedyourhead.at/content/remote-code-execution-in-suricata-update"]},"summary":"OISF suricata-update version 1.0.0a1 contains an Insecure Deserialization vulnerability in the insecure yaml.load-Function as used in the following files: config.py:136, config.py:142, sources.py:99 and sources.py:131.
