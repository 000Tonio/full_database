If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":10,"cvss-time":"2018-12-17T16:33:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-17411","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2018-12-17T16:33:00","references":["https://github.com/MrR3boot/CVE-Hunting/blob/master/iWay%20DQS%20XXE.pdf"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/MrR3boot/CVE-Hunting/blob/master/iWay%20DQS%20XXE.pdf"]},"summary":"An XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability exists in iWay Data Quality Suite Web Console 10.6.1.ga-2016-11-20.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:informationbuilders:data_quality_suite:10.6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:informationbuilders:data_quality_suite:10.6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:informationbuilders:data_quality_suite:10.6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
