The vulnerability is due to the presence of a hidden command in the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to an affected device via the console, forcing the device into ROMMON mode, and writing a malicious pattern to a specific memory address on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass signature validation checks by Cisco Secure Boot technology and load a compromised software image on the affected device. A compromised software image is any software image that has not been digitally signed by Cisco.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_rom_monitor:15.1\\(2\\)sy3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_rom_monitor:15.1\\(2\\)sy3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_rom_monitor:15.1\\(2\\)sy3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
