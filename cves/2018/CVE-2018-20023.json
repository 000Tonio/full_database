The adversary can leverage a race condition by \"running the race\", modifying the resource and modifying the normal execution flow. For instance, a race condition can occur while accessing a file: the adversary can trick the system by replacing the original file with his version and cause the system to read the malicious file."},{"id":"29","name":"Leveraging Time-of-Check and Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Conditions","prerequisites":"A resource is access/modified concurrently by multiple processes.

A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2020-10-23T13:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-665","id":"CVE-2018-20023","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-10-23T13:15:00","references":["https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/advisories/klcert-advisories/2018/12/19/klcert-18-033-libvnc-memory-leak/","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/12/msg00017.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/10/msg00042.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201908-05","https://usn.ubuntu.com/3877-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4547-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4587-1/","https://www.debian.org/security/2019/dsa-4383"],"refmap":{"debian":["DSA-4383"],"gentoo":["GLSA-201908-05"],"misc":["https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/advisories/klcert-advisories/2018/12/19/klcert-18-033-libvnc-memory-leak/"],"mlist":["[debian-lts-announce] 20181227 [SECURITY] [DLA 1617-1] libvncserver security update","[debian-lts-announce] 20191030 [SECURITY] [DLA 1979-1] italc security update"],"ubuntu":["USN-3877-1","USN-4547-1","USN-4587-1"]},"summary":"LibVNC before 8b06f835e259652b0ff026898014fc7297ade858 contains CWE-665: Improper Initialization vulnerability in VNC Repeater client code that allows attacker to read stack memory and can be abuse for information disclosure.
