Ensure that sufficient input validation is performed for any potentially untrusted data before it is used in any privileged context or zone Limit the flow of untrusted data into the privileged areas of the system that run in the higher trust zone Limit the sites that are being added to the local machine zone and restrict the privileges of the code running in that zone to the bare minimum Ensure proper HTML output encoding before writing user supplied data to the page","summary":"An attacker is able to cause a victim to load content into their web-browser that bypasses security zone controls and gain access to increased privileges to execute scripting code or other web objects such as unsigned ActiveX controls or applets. This is a privilege elevation attack targeted at zone-based web-browser security. In a zone-based model, pages belong to one of a set of zones corresponding to the level of privilege assigned to that page. Pages in an untrusted zone would have a lesser level of access to the system and/or be restricted in the types of executable content it was allowed to invoke. In a cross-zone scripting attack, a page that should be assigned to a less privileged zone is granted the privileges of a more trusted zone. This can be accomplished by exploiting bugs in the browser, exploiting incorrect configuration in the zone controls, through a cross-site scripting attack that causes the attackers' content to be treated as coming from a more trusted page, or by leveraging some piece of system functionality that is accessible from both the trusted and less trusted zone. This attack differs from \"Restful Privilege Escalation\" in that the latter correlates to the inadequate securing of RESTful access methods (such as HTTP DELETE) on the server, while cross-zone scripting attacks the concept of security zones as implemented by a browser."},{"id":"69","name":"Target Programs with Elevated Privileges","prerequisites":"The targeted program runs with elevated OS privileges. The targeted program accepts input data from the user or from another program. The targeted program does not perform input validation properly. The targeted program does not fail safely. For instance when a program fails it may authorize restricted access to anyone. The targeted program has a vulnerability such as buffer overflow which may be exploited if a malicious user can inject unvalidated data. For instance a buffer overflow interrupts the program as it executes, and makes it run additional code supplied by the attacker. If the program under attack has elevated privileges to the OS, the attacker can elevate its privileges (such as having root level access). The targeted program is giving away information about itself. Before performing such attack, an eventual attacker may need to gather information about the services running on the host target. The more the host target is verbose about the services that are running (version number of application, etc.) the more information can be gather by an attacker. This attack often requires communicating with the host target services directly. For instance Telnet may be enough to communicate with the host target.","related_weakness":["15","250","264"],"solutions":"Apply the principle of least privilege. Validate all untrusted data. Apply the latest patches. Scan your services and disable the ones which are not needed and are exposed unnecessarily. Exposing programs increases the attack surface. Only expose the services which are needed and have security mechanisms such as authentication built around them. Avoid revealing information about your system (e.g., version of the program) to anonymous users. Make sure that your program or service fail safely. What happen if the communication protocol is interrupted suddenly? What happen if a parameter is missing? Does your system have resistance and resilience to attack? Fail safely when a resource exhaustion occurs. If possible use a sandbox model which limits the actions that programs can take. A sandbox restricts a program to a set of privileges and commands that make it difficult or impossible for the program to cause any damage. Check your program for buffer overflow and format String vulnerabilities which can lead to execution of malicious code. Monitor traffic and resource usage and pay attention if resource exhaustion occurs. Protect your log file from unauthorized modification and log forging.","summary":"This attack targets programs running with elevated privileges. The attacker would try to leverage a bug in the running program and get arbitrary code to execute with elevated privileges. For instance an attacker would look for programs that write to the system directories or registry keys (such as HKLM, which stores a number of critical Windows environment variables). These programs are typically running with elevated privileges and have usually not been designed with security in mind. Such programs are excellent exploit targets because they yield lots of power when they break. The malicious user try to execute its code at the same level as a privileged system call."},{"id":"470","name":"Expanding Control over the Operating System from the Database","prerequisites":"A vulnerable DBMS is usedA SQL injection exists that gives an attacker access to the database or an attacker has access to the DBMS via other means","related_weakness":["250","89"],"solutions":"Implementation: Remove / disable all unneeded / unused functions of the DBMS system that may allow an attacker to elevate privileges if compromised","summary":"An attacker is able to leverage access gained to the database to read / write data to the file system, compromise the operating system, create a tunnel for accessing the host machine, and use this access to potentially attack other machines on the same network as the database machine. Traditionally SQL injections attacks are viewed as a way to gain unauthorized read access to the data stored in the database, modify the data in the database, delete the data, etc. However, almost every data base management system (DBMS) system includes facilities that if compromised allow an attacker complete access to the file system, operating system, and full access to the host running the database. The attacker can then use this privileged access to launch subsequent attacks. These facilities include dropping into a command shell, creating user defined functions that can call system level libraries present on the host machine, stored procedures, etc."}],"cvss":4.9,"cvss-time":"2023-02-12T23:31:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C","cwe":"CWE-250","id":"CVE-2018-10872","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2023-02-12T23:31:00","redhat":{"advisories":[{"rhsa":{"id":"RHSA-2018:2164"}}],"rpms":["kernel-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6","kernel-abi-whitelists-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6","kernel-bootwrapper-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6","kernel-debug-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6","kernel-debug-debuginfo-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6","kernel-debug-devel-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6","kernel-debuginfo-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6","kernel-debuginfo-common-i686-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6","kernel-debuginfo-common-ppc64-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6","kernel-debuginfo-common-s390x-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6","kernel-debuginfo-common-x86_64-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6","kernel-devel-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6","kernel-doc-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6","kernel-firmware-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6","kernel-headers-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6","kernel-kdump-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6","kernel-kdump-debuginfo-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6","kernel-kdump-devel-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6","perf-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6","perf-debuginfo-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6","python-perf-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6","python-perf-debuginfo-0:2.6.32-754.2.1.el6"]},"references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2018-10872","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:2164","https://help.ecostruxureit.com/display/public/UADCE725/Security+fixes+in+StruxureWare+Data+Center+Expert+v7.6.0","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2018-10872","https://help.ecostruxureit.com/display/public/UADCE725/Security+fixes+in+StruxureWare+Data+Center+Expert+v7.6.0"],"misc":["https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html"]},"summary":"A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel handled exceptions delivered after a stack switch operation via Mov SS or Pop SS instructions.
