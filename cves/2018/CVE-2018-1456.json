If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5.5,"cvss-time":"2018-07-24T14:42:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-1456","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2018-07-24T14:42:00","references":["http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22016795","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/140091"],"refmap":{"confirm":["http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22016795"],"xf":["ibm-rhapsody-cve20181456-info-disc(140091)"]},"summary":"IBM Rhapsody DM 5.0 through 5.0.2 and 6.0 through 6.0.5 is vulnerable to a XML External Entity Injection (XXE) attack when processing XML data.
