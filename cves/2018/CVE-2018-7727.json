This denial of service attack requires substantially fewer packets to be sent which makes DoS harder to detect. This is an equivalent of SYN flood in HTTP. The idea is to keep the HTTP session alive indefinitely and then repeat that hundreds of times. This attack targets resource depletion weaknesses in web server software. The web server will wait to attacker's responses on the initiated HTTP sessions while the connection threads are being exhausted."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2019-10-03T00:03:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-772","id":"CVE-2018-7727","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-03T00:03:00","redhat":{"advisories":[{"bugzilla":{"id":"1554676","title":"CVE-2018-7727 zziplib: Memory leak in memdisk.c:zzip_mem_disk_new() can lead to denial of service via crafted zip"},"oval":{"OR":[{"comment":"Red Hat Enterprise Linux must be installed","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhba:tst:20070304026"},{"AND":[{"comment":"Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is installed","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhba:tst:20150364027"},{"OR":[{"AND":[{"comment":"zziplib is earlier than 0:0.13.62-9.el7","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20183229001"},{"comment":"zziplib is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease2 key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20183229002"}]},{"AND":[{"comment":"zziplib-devel is earlier than 0:0.13.62-9.el7","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20183229003"},{"comment":"zziplib-devel is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease2 key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20183229004"}]},{"AND":[{"comment":"zziplib-utils is earlier than 0:0.13.62-9.el7","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20183229005"},{"comment":"zziplib-utils is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease2 key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20183229006"}]}]}]}]},"rhsa":{"id":"RHSA-2018:3229","released":"2018-10-30","severity":"Low","title":"RHSA-2018:3229: zziplib security update (Low)"}}],"rpms":["zziplib-0:0.13.62-9.el7","zziplib-debuginfo-0:0.13.62-9.el7","zziplib-devel-0:0.13.62-9.el7","zziplib-utils-0:0.13.62-9.el7"]},"references":["https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3229","https://github.com/gdraheim/zziplib/issues/40"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/gdraheim/zziplib/issues/40"]},"summary":"An issue was discovered in ZZIPlib 0.13.68.
