If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2019-05-15T13:48:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-8940","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-05-15T13:48:00","references":["https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/May/9"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/May/9"]},"summary":"ClientServiceConfigController.cs in Enghouse Cloud Contact Center Platform 7.2.5 has functionality for loading external XML files and parsing them, allowing an attacker to upload a malicious XML file and reference it in the URL of the application, forcing the application to load and parse the malicious XML file, aka an XXE issue.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:enghouse:contact_center\\:_service_provider:7.2.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:enghouse:contact_center\\:_service_provider:7.2.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:enghouse:contact_center\\:_service_provider:7.2.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
