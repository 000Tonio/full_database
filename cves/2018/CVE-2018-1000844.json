If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.4,"cvss-time":"2019-07-01T12:44:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-1000844","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-07-01T12:44:00","references":["https://github.com/square/retrofit/pull/2735"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/square/retrofit/pull/2735"]},"summary":"Square Open Source Retrofit version Prior to commit 4a693c5aeeef2be6c7ecf80e7b5ec79f6ab59437 contains a XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in JAXB that can result in An attacker could use this to remotely read files from the file system or to perform SSRF..
