If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:31:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2018-0108","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:31:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102720","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1040238","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180117-wms"],"refmap":{"bid":["102720"],"confirm":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20180117-wms"],"sectrack":["1040238"]},"summary":"A vulnerability in Cisco WebEx Meetings Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to collect customer files via an out-of-band XML External Entity (XXE) injection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to gain information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks. The vulnerability is due to the ability of an attacker to perform an out-of-band XXE injection on the system, which could allow an attacker to capture customer files and redirect them to another destination address. An exploit could allow the attacker to discover sensitive customer data.
