The vulnerability is due to a double-free-in-memory handling by the affected software when specific HTTP requests are processed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific HTTP requests to the web user interface of the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have access to the management interface of the affected software, which is typically connected to a restricted management network.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
