Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.8,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:42:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2018-7529","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:42:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/103399","https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-18-072-02"],"refmap":{"bid":["103399"],"misc":["https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-18-072-02"]},"summary":"A Deserialization of Untrusted Data issue was discovered in OSIsoft PI Data Archive versions 2017 and prior.
