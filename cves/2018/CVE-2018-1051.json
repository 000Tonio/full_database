Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:38:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2018-1051","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:38:00","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1535411"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1535411"]},"summary":"It was found that the fix for CVE-2016-9606 in versions 3.0.22 and 3.1.2 was incomplete and Yaml unmarshalling in Resteasy is still possible via `Yaml.load()` in YamlProvider.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:redhat:resteasy:3.0.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:redhat:resteasy:3.0.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:redhat:resteasy:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:redhat:resteasy:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:redhat:resteasy:3.0.22:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:resteasy:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
