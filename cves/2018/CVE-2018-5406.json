An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform sensitive actions such as adding a new administrator account or changing the appliance’s settings. A malicious internal user could also gain administrator privileges of this appliance and use it to visit a malicious link that exploits this vulnerability. This could cause the application to perform sensitive actions such as adding a new administrator account or changing the appliance’s settings. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could add an administrator-level account or change the appliance's settings.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:quest:kace_systems_management_appliance_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:quest:kace_systems_management_appliance_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:quest:kace_systems_management_appliance:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:quest:kace_systems_management_appliance:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:quest:kace_systems_management_appliance_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
