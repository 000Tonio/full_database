NOTE: on 20060227, the vendor disputed the accuracy of this report, saying that the p_news_id, news_and_events_new.asp, and news.asp are not specifically part of their product, although they could be dynamically generated through use of the product.  Some investigation by CVE suggests evidence that the news_and_events_new.asp page has at least a forced invalid SQL syntax error, but this could not be repeated for news.asp.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:quantum_art:qp7_enterprise:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:quantum_art:qp7_enterprise:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:quantum_art:qp7_enterprise:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
