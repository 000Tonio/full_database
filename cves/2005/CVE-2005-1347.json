Adobe Acrobat reader (AcroRd32.exe) 6.0 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (\"Invalid-ID-Handle-Error\" error) and modify memory beginning at a particular address, possibly allowing the execution of arbitrary code, via a crafted PDF file.  NOTE: the vendor has stated that the reporter refused to provide sufficient details to confirm the issue.  In addition, due to the lack of details in the original advisory, an independent verification is not possible.  Finally, the reliability of the original reporter is unknown.  This item has only been assigned a CVE identifier for tracking purposes, and to serve as a concrete example of the newly defined UNVERIFIABLE and PRERELEASE content decisions in CVE, which must be discussed by the Editorial Board. Without additional details or independent verification by reliable sources, it is highly likely that this item will be REJECTED.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader:5.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader:5.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader:5.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:adobe:acrobat_reader:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
