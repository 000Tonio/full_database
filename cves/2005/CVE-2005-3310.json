NOTE: it could be argued that this vulnerability is due to a design flaw in Internet Explorer (CVE-2005-3312) and the proper fix should be in that browser; if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in phpBB.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:phpbb_group:phpbb:2.0.17:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:phpbb_group:phpbb:2.0.17:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:phpbb_group:phpbb:2.0.17:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
