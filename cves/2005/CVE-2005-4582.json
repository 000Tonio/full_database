NOTE: the same attack vectors apply to common web browsers that are able to communicate with untrusted web servers, and other problems related to DNS design issues.  Therefore this may not be a specific vulnerability.  However, a client would reasonably expect to receive content only from the server.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:scott_draves:electric_sheep:2.6.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:scott_draves:electric_sheep:2.6.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:scott_draves:electric_sheep:2.6.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
