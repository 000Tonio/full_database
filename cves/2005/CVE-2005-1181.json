PHP remote code injection vulnerability in loader.php for Ariadne CMS 2.4 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by modifying the ariadne parameter to reference a URL on a remote web server that contains the code.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, saying that loader.php first requires the \"ariadne.inc\" file, which defines the $ariadne variable, and thus it cannot be modified by an attacker. In addition, CVE personnel have partially verified the dispute via source code inspection of Ariadne 2.4 as available on July 5, 2005.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ariadne:ariadne_cms:2.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ariadne:ariadne_cms:2.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:ariadne:ariadne_cms:2.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
