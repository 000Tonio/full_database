The adversary can leverage a race condition by \"running the race\", modifying the resource and modifying the normal execution flow. For instance, a race condition can occur while accessing a file: the adversary can trick the system by replacing the original file with his version and cause the system to read the malicious file."},{"id":"29","name":"Leveraging Time-of-Check and Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Conditions","prerequisites":"A resource is access/modified concurrently by multiple processes.

A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":5.1,"cvss-time":"2021-07-23T12:55:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2005-3240","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-07-23T12:55:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/424863/100/0/threaded","http://www.securiteam.com/windowsntfocus/5MP0B0UHPA.html","http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/archive/2006/02/13/419439.aspx","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/16352","http://www.osvdb.org/2707","http://securitytracker.com/id?1015049","http://secunia.com/advisories/18787","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2006/0553","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/24648","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/424940/100/0/threaded"],"refmap":{"bid":["16352"],"bugtraq":["20060213 Internet Explorer drag&drop 0day","20060214 Advisory: Internet Explorer Drag and Drop Redeux [CVE-2005-3240] (fwd)"],"misc":["http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/archive/2006/02/13/419439.aspx","http://www.securiteam.com/windowsntfocus/5MP0B0UHPA.html"],"osvdb":["2707"],"sectrack":["1015049"],"secunia":["18787"],"vulnwatch":["20060213 Advisory: Internet Explorer Drag and Drop Redeux [CVE-2005-3240] (fwd)"],"vupen":["ADV-2006-0553"],"xf":["ie-dragdrop-variant(24648)"]},"summary":"Race condition in Microsoft Internet Explorer allows user-assisted attackers to overwrite arbitrary files and possibly execute code by tricking a user into performing a drag-and-drop action from certain objects, such as file objects within a folder view, then predicting the drag action, and re-focusing to a malicious window.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.01:sp3:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.01:sp3:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.01:sp4:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.01:sp4:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.01:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.01:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.5:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.5:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.01:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.01:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.01:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.01:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:ie:6.0:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:ie:6.0:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.5:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.5:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.01:sp3:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.01:sp4:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.01:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.5:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.01:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.01:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:ie:6.0:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:5.5:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
