Most applications assume that users will provide static text and may respond unpredictably to the presence of formatting character. For example, in certain functions of the C programming languages such as printf, the formatting character %s will print the contents of a memory location expecting this location to identify a string and the formatting character %n prints the number of DWORD written in the memory. An adversary can use this to read or write to memory locations or files, or simply to manipulate the value of the resulting text in unexpected ways. Reading or writing memory may result in program crashes and writing memory could result in the execution of arbitrary code if the adversary can write to the program stack."}],"cvss":10,"cvss-time":"2018-10-03T21:33:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-134","id":"CVE-2005-3656","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2018-10-03T21:33:00","oval":[{"accepted":"2013-04-29T04:07:00.009-04:00","class":"vulnerability","contributors":[{"name":"Aharon Chernin","organization":"SCAP.com, LLC"},{"name":"Dragos Prisaca","organization":"G2, Inc."}],"definition_extensions":[{"comment":"The operating system installed on the system is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:11782"},{"comment":"CentOS Linux 3.x","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:16651"},{"comment":"The operating system installed on the system is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:11831"},{"comment":"CentOS Linux 4.x","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:16636"},{"comment":"Oracle Linux 4.x","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:15990"}],"description":"Multiple format string vulnerabilities in logging functions in mod_auth_pgsql before 2.0.3, when used for user authentication against a PostgreSQL database, allows remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code, as demonstrated via the username.","family":"unix","id":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:10600","status":"accepted","submitted":"2010-07-09T03:56:16-04:00","title":"Multiple format string vulnerabilities in logging functions in mod_auth_pgsql before 2.0.3, when used for user authentication against a PostgreSQL database, allows remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code, as demonstrated via the username.","version":"28"}],"redhat":{"advisories":[{"bugzilla":{"id":"1617835","title":"CVE-2005-3656 security flaw"},"oval":{"OR":[{"comment":"Red Hat Enterprise Linux must be installed","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhba:tst:20070304026"},{"AND":[{"comment":"Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 is installed","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhba:tst:20070304025"},{"comment":"mod_auth_pgsql is earlier than 0:2.0.1-7.1","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20060164001"},{"comment":"mod_auth_pgsql is signed with Red Hat master key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20060164002"}]}]},"rhsa":{"id":"RHSA-2006:0164","released":"2006-01-06","severity":"Critical","title":"RHSA-2006:0164: mod_auth_pgsql security update (Critical)"}}],"rpms":["mod_auth_pgsql-0:2.0.1-4.ent.1","mod_auth_pgsql-0:2.0.1-7.1","mod_auth_pgsql-debuginfo-0:2.0.1-4.ent.1","mod_auth_pgsql-debuginfo-0:2.0.1-7.1"]},"references":["ftp://patches.sgi.com/support/free/security/advisories/20060101-01-U","http://secunia.com/advisories/18304","http://secunia.com/advisories/18321","http://secunia.com/advisories/18347","http://secunia.com/advisories/18348","http://secunia.com/advisories/18350","http://secunia.com/advisories/18397","http://secunia.com/advisories/18403","http://secunia.com/advisories/18463","http://secunia.com/advisories/18517","http://securitytracker.com/id?1015446","http://www.debian.de/security/2006/dsa-935","http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-200601-05.xml","http://www.giuseppetanzilli.it/mod%5Fauth%5Fpgsql2/","http://www.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=367","http://www.mandriva.com/security/advisories?name=MDKSA-2006:009","http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2006-January/msg00015.html","http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2006-January/msg00016.html","http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2006-0164.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/16153","http://www.trustix.org/errata/2006/0002/","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2006/0070","https://oval.cisecurity.org/repository/search/definition/oval%3Aorg.mitre.oval%3Adef%3A10600","https://usn.ubuntu.com/239-1/"],"refmap":{"bid":["16153"],"confirm":["http://www.giuseppetanzilli.it/mod%5Fauth%5Fpgsql2/","http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2006-January/msg00015.html","http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2006-January/msg00016.html"],"debian":["DSA-935"],"gentoo":["GLSA-200601-05"],"idefense":["20060109 Multiple Vendor mod_auth_pgsql Format String Vulnerability"],"mandriva":["MDKSA-2006:009"],"sectrack":["1015446"],"secunia":["18304","18321","18347","18348","18350","18397","18403","18463","18517"],"sgi":["20060101-01-U"],"trustix":["2006-0002"],"ubuntu":["USN-239-1"],"vupen":["ADV-2006-0070"]},"summary":"Multiple format string vulnerabilities in logging functions in mod_auth_pgsql before 2.0.3, when used for user authentication against a PostgreSQL database, allows remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code, as demonstrated via the username.
