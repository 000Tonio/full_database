NOTE: this issue might be the same as the .m3u vulnerability in CVE-2004-1569, but if so, then CD:SF-LOC suggests creating a different identifier since the .m3u issue would affect different versions than the .pls issue.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:illustrate:dbpoweramp_music_converter:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:illustrate:dbpoweramp_music_converter:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:illustrate:dbpoweramp_music_converter:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
