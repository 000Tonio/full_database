NOTE: it is not clear whether this problem can be exploited for code execution. If not, then perhaps the user-assisted nature of the attack should exclude the issue from inclusion in CVE.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:rarlab:winrar:3.51:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:rarlab:winrar:3.51:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:rarlab:winrar:3.51:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
