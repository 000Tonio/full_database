NOTE: the normal operation of InfoPath appears to involve a local user without any privilege boundaries, so this might not be a vulnerability in InfoPath.  If no realistic scenarios exist for this problem in other products, then perhaps it should be excluded from CVE.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:ie:6.0:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:ie:6.0:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_2003_server:r2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_2003_server:r2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_xp:*:gold:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_xp:*:gold:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:ie:6.0:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_2003_server:r2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_xp:*:gold:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
