Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2020-05-15T13:43:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2019-16112","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-05-15T13:43:00","references":["https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48462"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48462"]},"summary":"TylerTech Eagle 2018.3.11 deserializes untrusted user input, resulting in remote code execution via a crafted Java object to the recorder/ServiceManager?service=tyler.empire.settings.SettingManager URI.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:tylertech:eagle:2018.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:tylertech:eagle:2018.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:tylertech:eagle:2018.3.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
