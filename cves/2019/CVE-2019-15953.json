An authenticated user with limited privileges can get access to a resource that they do not own by calling the associated API. The product correctly manages privileges only for the front-end resource path, not for API requests. This leads to vertical and horizontal privilege escalation.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:totaljs:total.js_cms:12.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:totaljs:total.js_cms:12.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:totaljs:total.js_cms:12.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
