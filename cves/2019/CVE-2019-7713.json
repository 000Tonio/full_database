There is a heap-based buffer overflow in the function responsible for printing the shell prompt, when a custom modifier is used to display information such as a process ID, IP address, or current working directory. Modifier expansion triggers this overflow, causing memory corruption or a crash (and also leaks memory address information).","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:ghs:integrity_rtos:5.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:ghs:integrity_rtos:5.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:ghs:integrity_rtos:5.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
