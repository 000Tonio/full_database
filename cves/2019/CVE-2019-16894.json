Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2019-16894","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","references":["https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47426"],"refmap":{"exploit-db":["47426"]},"summary":"download.php in inoERP 4.15 allows SQL injection through insecure deserialization.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:inoideas:inoerp:4.15:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:inoideas:inoerp:4.15:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:inoideas:inoerp:4.15:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
