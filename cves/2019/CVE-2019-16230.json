It is not attacker controllable and OOM at that time is highly unlikely.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:5.2.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:5.2.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:5.2.14:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
