If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2019-08-30T13:54:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-14258","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-08-30T13:54:00","references":["https://www.coalfire.com/The-Coalfire-Blog","https://www.coalfire.com/The-Coalfire-Blog/August-2019/Getting-more-from-a-compliance-test"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://www.coalfire.com/The-Coalfire-Blog/August-2019/Getting-more-from-a-compliance-test"],"misc":["https://www.coalfire.com/The-Coalfire-Blog"]},"summary":"The XML-RPC subsystem in Zenoss 2.5.3 allows XXE attacks that lead to unauthenticated information disclosure via port 9988.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:zenoss:zenoss:2.5.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:zenoss:zenoss:2.5.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:zenoss:zenoss:2.5.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
