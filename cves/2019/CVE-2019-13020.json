This has two potential areas for abuse. First, a specially crafted URL could be used in a phishing attack to hijack the trust the user and the browser have with the website and could serve malicious content from a third-party attacker-controlled system. Second, arguably more severe, is the potential for an attacker to circumvent firewall controls, by proxying traffic, unauthenticated, into the internal network from the internet.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:trms:tightrope_media_carousel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:trms:tightrope_media_carousel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:trms:tightrope_media_carousel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
