Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.4,"cvss-time":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2019-11458","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","references":["https://bakery.cakephp.org/2019/04/23/cakephp_377_3615_3518_released.html","https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/commit/1a74e798309192a9895c9cedabd714ceee345f4e","https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/commits/master","https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/3.7.6...3.7.7","https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/releases"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://bakery.cakephp.org/2019/04/23/cakephp_377_3615_3518_released.html","https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/commit/1a74e798309192a9895c9cedabd714ceee345f4e"],"misc":["https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/commits/master","https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/compare/3.7.6...3.7.7","https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp/releases"]},"summary":"An issue was discovered in SmtpTransport in CakePHP 3.7.6.
