The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":4.4,"cvss-time":"2023-02-03T17:22:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2019-18996","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2023-02-03T17:22:00","references":["http://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=3ADR010466&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://search.abb.com/library/Download.aspx?DocumentID=3ADR010466&LanguageCode=en&DocumentPartId=&Action=Launch"]},"summary":"Path settings in HMIStudio component of ABB PB610 Panel Builder 600 versions 2.8.0.424 and earlier accept DLLs outside of the program directory, potentially allowing an attacker with access to the local file system the execution of code in the applicationâ€™s context.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:abb:pb610_panel_builder_600:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:abb:pb610_panel_builder_600:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:abb:pb610_panel_builder_600:1.90.0.975:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:abb:pb610_panel_builder_600:1.90.0.975:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:abb:pb610_panel_builder_600:2.8.0.424:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:abb:pb610_panel_builder_600:2.8.0.424:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:abb:pb610_panel_builder_600:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:abb:pb610_panel_builder_600:1.90.0.975:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:abb:pb610_panel_builder_600:2.8.0.424:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
