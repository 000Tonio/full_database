Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2019-12-12T21:53:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2019-19230","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-12-12T21:53:00","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155631/CA-Nolio-6.6-Arbitrary-Code-Execution.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Dec/16","https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/Dec/16","https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/product-content/recommended-reading/security-notices/ca20191209-01-security-notice-for-ca-nolio-release-automation.html?r=2"],"refmap":{"bugtraq":["20191210 CA20191209-01: Security Notice for CA Nolio (Release Automation)"],"confirm":["https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/product-content/recommended-reading/security-notices/ca20191209-01-security-notice-for-ca-nolio-release-automation.html?r=2"],"fulldisc":["20191210 CA20191209-01: Security Notice for CA Nolio (Release Automation)"],"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155631/CA-Nolio-6.6-Arbitrary-Code-Execution.html"]},"summary":"An unsafe deserialization vulnerability exists in CA Release Automation (Nolio) 6.6 with the DataManagement component that can allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:nolio:6.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:nolio:6.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:nolio:6.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
