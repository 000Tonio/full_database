This was caused by an insecure handling of the register parameters, because the size used within a memcpy() function, which copied the action value into a local variable, was not checked properly.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:xerox:phaser_3320_firmware:v53.006.16.000:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:xerox:phaser_3320_firmware:v53.006.16.000:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:xerox:phaser_3320:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:xerox:phaser_3320:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:xerox:phaser_3320_firmware:v53.006.16.000:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
