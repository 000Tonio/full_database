If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2019-04-19T15:55:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-8999","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-04-19T15:55:00","references":["http://support.blackberry.com/kb/articleDetail?articleNumber=000056241"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://support.blackberry.com/kb/articleDetail?articleNumber=000056241"]},"summary":"An XML External Entity vulnerability in the UEM Core of BlackBerry UEM version(s) earlier than 12.10.1a could allow an attacker to potentially gain read access to files on any system reachable by the UEM service account.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blackberry:unified_endpoint_management:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blackberry:unified_endpoint_management:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:blackberry:unified_endpoint_management:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
