If thread_data is NULL when assigned to current, and modified by another thread before a certain tftpd_list.c check, there is a crash when dereferencing current->next.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:atftp_project:atftp:0.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:atftp_project:atftp:0.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:atftp_project:atftp:0.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
