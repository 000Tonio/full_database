If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5.5,"cvss-time":"2022-01-01T20:08:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-19031","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-01-01T20:08:00","references":["https://hackpuntes.com/cve-2019-19031-easy-xml-editor-1-7-8-inyeccion-xml/","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155996/Easy-XML-Editor-1.7.8-XML-Injection.html"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155996/Easy-XML-Editor-1.7.8-XML-Injection.html","https://hackpuntes.com/cve-2019-19031-easy-xml-editor-1-7-8-inyeccion-xml/"]},"summary":"Easy XML Editor through v1.7.8 is affected by: XML External Entity Injection.
