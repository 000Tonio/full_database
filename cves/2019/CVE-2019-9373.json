Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":2.1,"cvss-time":"2019-10-03T20:24:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2019-9373","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-03T20:24:00","references":["https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/android-10"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/android-10"]},"summary":"In JobStore, there is a mismatched serialization/deserialization for the \"battery-not-low\" job attribute.
