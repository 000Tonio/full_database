Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2019-06-23T19:17:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2019-11011","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-06-23T19:17:00","references":["https://blogs.akamai.com/sitr/2019/06/cloudtest-vulnerability-cve-2019-11011.html"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://blogs.akamai.com/sitr/2019/06/cloudtest-vulnerability-cve-2019-11011.html"]},"summary":"Akamai CloudTest before 58.30 allows remote code execution.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:akamai:cloudtest:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:akamai:cloudtest:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:akamai:cloudtest:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
