When using a code book, application error messages aren't generated in string or stack trace form, but are catalogued and replaced with a unique (often integer-based) value 'coding' for the error. Such a technique will require helpdesk and hosting personnel to use a 'code book' or similar mapping to decode application errors/logs in order to respond to them normally. Design: wrap application functionality (preferably through the underlying framework) in an output encoding scheme that obscures or cleanses error messages to prevent such attacks. Such a technique is often used in conjunction with the above 'code book' suggestion. Implementation: Obfuscate server fields of HTTP response. Implementation: Hide inner ordering of HTTP response header. Implementation: Customizing HTTP error codes such as 404 or 500. Implementation: Hide HTTP response header software information filed. Implementation: Hide cookie's software information filed. Implementation: Obfuscate database type in Database API's error message.","summary":"An attacker sends random, malformed, or otherwise unexpected messages to a target application and observes the application's log or error messages returned. Fuzzing techniques involve sending random or malformed messages to a target and monitoring the target's response. The attacker does not initially know how a target will respond to individual messages but by attempting a large number of message variants they may find a variant that trigger's desired behavior. In this attack, the purpose of the fuzzing is to observe the application's log and error messages, although fuzzing a target can also sometimes cause the target to enter an unstable state, causing a crash. By observing logs and error messages, the attacker can learn details about the configuration of the target application and might be able to cause the target to disclose sensitive information."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-532","id":"CVE-2019-9976","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","references":["https://blog.burghardt.pl/2019/03/boa-webserver-on-dasan-h660rm-devices-with-firmware-1-03-0022-saves-post-data-including-credentials-to-tmp-boa-temp/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://blog.burghardt.pl/2019/03/boa-webserver-on-dasan-h660rm-devices-with-firmware-1-03-0022-saves-post-data-including-credentials-to-tmp-boa-temp/"]},"summary":"The Boa server configuration on DASAN H660RM devices with firmware 1.03-0022 logs POST data to the /tmp/boa-temp file, which allows logged-in users to read the credentials of administration web interface users.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:dasannetworks:h660rm_firmware:1.03-0022:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:dasannetworks:h660rm_firmware:1.03-0022:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:dasannetworks:h660rm:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:dasannetworks:h660rm:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:dasannetworks:h660rm_firmware:1.03-0022:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
