An out of bounds write occurs in AP4_CttsTableEntry::AP4_CttsTableEntry() located in Core/Ap4Array.h. It can be triggered by sending a crafted file to (for example) the mp42hls binary. It allows an attacker to cause Denial of Service (Segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:axiosys:bento4:1.5.1-628:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:axiosys:bento4:1.5.1-628:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:axiosys:bento4:1.5.1-628:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
