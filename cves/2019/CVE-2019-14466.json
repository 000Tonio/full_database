Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":5.5,"cvss-time":"2020-01-10T19:28:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2019-14466","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-01-10T19:28:00","references":["https://github.com/gosa-project/gosa-core/pull/29","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/08/msg00039.html"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/gosa-project/gosa-core/pull/29","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2019/08/msg00039.html"]},"summary":"The GOsa_Filter_Settings cookie in GONICUS GOsa 2.7.5.2 is vulnerable to PHP objection injection, which allows a remote authenticated attacker to perform file deletions (in the context of the user account that runs the web server) via a crafted cookie value, because unserialize is used to restore filter settings from a cookie.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:gosa_project:gosa:2.7.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:gosa_project:gosa:2.7.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:gosa_project:gosa:2.7.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
