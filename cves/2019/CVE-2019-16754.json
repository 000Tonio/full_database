This requires spoofing an MQTT server response. To do so, the attacker needs to know the MQTT MsgID of a pending MQTT protocol message and the ephemeral port used by RIOT's MQTT implementation. Additionally, the server IP address is required for spoofing the packet.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:riot-os:riot:2019.07:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:riot-os:riot:2019.07:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:riot-os:riot:2019.07:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
