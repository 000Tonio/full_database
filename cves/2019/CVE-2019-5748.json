If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2019-01-30T20:19:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-5748","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-01-30T20:19:00","references":["https://github.com/traccar/traccar/commit/d7f6c53fd88635885914013649b6807ec53227bf","https://www.traccar.org/blog/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/traccar/traccar/commit/d7f6c53fd88635885914013649b6807ec53227bf","https://www.traccar.org/blog/"]},"summary":"In Traccar Server version 4.2, protocol/SpotProtocolDecoder.java might allow XXE attacks.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:traccar:server:4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:traccar:server:4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:traccar:server:4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
