If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2019-08-05T13:57:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-1010202","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-08-05T13:57:00","references":["https://github.com/thinkgem/jeesite/blob/master/src/main/java/com/thinkgem/jeesite/modules/act/service/ActProcessService.java"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/thinkgem/jeesite/blob/master/src/main/java/com/thinkgem/jeesite/modules/act/service/ActProcessService.java"]},"summary":"Jeesite 1.2.7 is affected by: XML External Entity (XXE).
