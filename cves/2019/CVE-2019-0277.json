If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5.5,"cvss-time":"2019-03-13T18:16:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-0277","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-03-13T18:16:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107356","https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2764283","https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=515408080"],"refmap":{"bid":["107356"],"misc":["https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2764283","https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=515408080"]},"summary":"SAP HANA extended application services, version 1, advanced does not sufficiently validate an XML document accepted from an authenticated developer with privileges to the SAP space (XML External Entity vulnerability).","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:hana_extended_application_services:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:hana_extended_application_services:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sap:hana_extended_application_services:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
