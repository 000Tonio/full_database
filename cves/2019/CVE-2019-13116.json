Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2019-10-29T22:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2019-13116","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-10-29T22:15:00","references":["https://docs.mulesoft.com/release-notes/mule-runtime/mule-3.8.0-release-notes","https://threat.tevora.com/mulesoft-3-8-unauthenticated-rce/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://docs.mulesoft.com/release-notes/mule-runtime/mule-3.8.0-release-notes","https://threat.tevora.com/mulesoft-3-8-unauthenticated-rce/"]},"summary":"The MuleSoft Mule Community Edition runtime engine before 3.8 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because of Java Deserialization, related to Apache Commons Collections","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mulesoft:mule_runtime:3.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mulesoft:mule_runtime:3.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:mulesoft:mule_runtime:3.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
