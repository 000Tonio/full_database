The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":6.9,"cvss-time":"2019-10-11T17:22:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2019-3745","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-11T17:22:00","references":["https://www.dell.com/support/article/SLN318889"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.dell.com/support/article/SLN318889"]},"summary":"The vulnerability is limited to the installers of Dell Encryption Enterprise versions prior to 10.4.0 and Dell Endpoint Security Suite Enterprise versions prior to 2.4.0. This issue is exploitable only during the installation of the product by an administrator. A local authenticated low privileged user potentially could exploit this vulnerability by staging a malicious DLL in the search path of the installer prior to its execution by a local administrator. This would cause loading of the malicious DLL, which would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of an administrator.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:dell:encryption:-:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:dell:encryption:-:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:dell:endpoint_security_suite_enterprise:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:dell:endpoint_security_suite_enterprise:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:dell:encryption:-:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:dell:endpoint_security_suite_enterprise:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
