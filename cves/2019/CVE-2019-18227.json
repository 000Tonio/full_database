If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2021-05-13T19:26:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-18227","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-05-13T19:26:00","references":["https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-19-304-01","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-944/","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-939/","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-943/","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-942/","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-947/","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-959/","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-953/","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-945/","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-954/","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-936/","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-946/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-19-304-01","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-936/","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-939/","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-942/","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-943/","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-944/","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-945/","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-946/","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-947/","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-953/","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-954/","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-19-959/"]},"summary":"Advantech WISE-PaaS/RMM, Versions 3.3.29 and prior.
