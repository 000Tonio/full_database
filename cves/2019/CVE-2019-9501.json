By supplying a vendor information element with a data length larger than 32 bytes, a heap buffer overflow is triggered in wlc_wpa_sup_eapol. In the worst case scenario, by sending specially-crafted WiFi packets, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. More typically, this vulnerability will result in denial-of-service conditions.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:synology:router_manager:1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:synology:router_manager:1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:broadcom:bcm4339_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:broadcom:bcm4339_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:broadcom:bcm4339:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:broadcom:bcm4339:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:synology:router_manager:1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:broadcom:bcm4339_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
