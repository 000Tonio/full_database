The Host header value overflows a buffer and overwrites a Structured Exception Handler (SEH) address. An unauthenticated attacker can submit a Host header value of 2047 bytes or more to overflow the buffer and overwrite the SEH address, which can then be leveraged to execute attacker-controlled code on the server.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:abb:pb610_panel_builder_600_firmware:1.91:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:abb:pb610_panel_builder_600_firmware:1.91:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:abb:pb610_panel_builder_600_firmware:2.8.0.367:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:abb:pb610_panel_builder_600_firmware:2.8.0.367:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:abb:pb610_panel_builder_600:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:abb:pb610_panel_builder_600:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:abb:pb610_panel_builder_600_firmware:1.91:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:abb:pb610_panel_builder_600_firmware:2.8.0.367:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
