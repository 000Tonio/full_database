If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:45:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-10976","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:45:00","references":["https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-19-204-01"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-19-204-01"]},"summary":"Mitsubishi Electric FR Configurator2, Version 1.16S and prior.
