Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":9.3,"cvss-time":"2022-04-20T18:28:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2019-6834","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2022-04-20T18:28:00","references":["https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/SEVD-2019-225-06/"],"summary":"A CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability exists which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system with SYSTEM privileges when placing a malicious user to be authenticated for this vulnerability to be successfully exploited.
