The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":6.9,"cvss-time":"2021-07-21T11:39:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2019-18670","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2021-07-21T11:39:00","references":["https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r0cr-H_FMc8V4hwlqF1MAEhSSnztm5sp","https://us.answers.acer.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/64586"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://us.answers.acer.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/64586"],"misc":["https://drive.google.com/open?id=1r0cr-H_FMc8V4hwlqF1MAEhSSnztm5sp"]},"summary":"In the Quick Access Service (QAAdminAgent.exe) in Acer Quick Access V2.01.3000 through 2.01.3027 and V3.00.3000 through V3.00.3008, a REGULAR user can load an arbitrary unsigned DLL into the signed service's process, which is running as NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM.
