The vulnerability is due to improper handling of Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) renegotiation requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending renegotiation requests at a high rate. An successful exploit could increase the resource usage on the system, eventually leading to a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects version 2.1.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.1\\(0.907\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.1\\(0.907\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:cisco:identity_services_engine:2.1\\(0.907\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
