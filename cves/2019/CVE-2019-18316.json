Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2022-03-04T20:48:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2019-18316","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-03-04T20:48:00","references":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-451445.pdf"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-451445.pdf"]},"summary":"A vulnerability has been identified in SPPA-T3000 Application Server (All versions < Service Pack R8.2 SP2).
