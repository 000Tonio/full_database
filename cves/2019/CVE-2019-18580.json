Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":10,"cvss-time":"2019-12-16T21:16:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2019-18580","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2019-12-16T21:16:00","references":["https://www.dell.com/support/security/en-us/details/538977/DSA-2019-176-Dell-EMC-Storage-Monitoring-and-Reporting-SMR-Java-RMI-Deserialization-of-Untruste"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.dell.com/support/security/en-us/details/538977/DSA-2019-176-Dell-EMC-Storage-Monitoring-and-Reporting-SMR-Java-RMI-Deserialization-of-Untruste"]},"summary":"Dell EMC Storage Monitoring and Reporting version 4.3.1 contains a Java RMI Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability.
