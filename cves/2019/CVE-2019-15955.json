A low privilege user can perform a simple transformation of a cookie to obtain the random values inside it. If an attacker can discover a session cookie owned by an admin, then it is possible to brute force it with O(n)=2n instead of O(n)=n^x complexity, and steal the admin password.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:totaljs:total.js_cms:12.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:totaljs:total.js_cms:12.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:totaljs:total.js_cms:12.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
