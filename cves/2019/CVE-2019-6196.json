The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":6.9,"cvss-time":"2020-06-22T15:12:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2019-6196","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2020-06-22T15:12:00","references":["https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/product_security/len-27431"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://support.lenovo.com/us/en/product_security/len-27431"]},"summary":"A symbolic link vulnerability in some Lenovo installation packages, prior to version 1.2.9.3, could allow privileged file operations during file extraction and installation.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:lenovo:installation_package:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:lenovo:installation_package:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:lenovo:installation_package:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
