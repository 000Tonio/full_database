Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2019-10-08T18:23:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2019-17080","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-10-08T18:23:00","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154722/mintinstall-7.9.9-Code-Execution.html","https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=143&t=302960","https://github.com/Andhrimnirr/Mintinstall-object-injection","https://github.com/linuxmint/mintinstall/blob/master/debian/changelog"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/154722/mintinstall-7.9.9-Code-Execution.html","https://forums.linuxmint.com/viewtopic.php?f=143&t=302960","https://github.com/Andhrimnirr/Mintinstall-object-injection","https://github.com/linuxmint/mintinstall/blob/master/debian/changelog"]},"summary":"mintinstall (aka Software Manager) 7.9.9 for Linux Mint allows code execution if a REVIEWS_CACHE file is controlled by an attacker, because an unpickle occurs.
