The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."},{"id":"471","name":"Search Order Hijacking","prerequisites":"Attacker has a mechanism to place its malicious libraries in the needed location on the file system.","related_weakness":["427"],"solutions":"Design: Sign system DLLs so that unauthorized DLLs can be detected.","summary":"An adversary exploits a weakness in an application's specification of external libraries to exploit the functionality of the loader where the process loading the library searches first in the same directory in which the process binary resides and then in other directories. Exploitation of this preferential search order can allow an attacker to make the loading process load the adversary's rogue library rather than the legitimate library. This attack can be leveraged with many different libraries and with many different loading processes. No forensic trails are left in the system's registry or file system that an incorrect library had been loaded."}],"cvss":3.6,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:48:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N","cwe":"CWE-427","id":"CVE-2019-1794","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:48:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108032","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190417-cdc-hijack"],"refmap":{"bid":["108032"],"cisco":["20190417 Cisco Directory Connector Search Order Hijacking Vulnerability"]},"summary":"A vulnerability in the search path processing of Cisco Directory Connector could allow an authenticated, local attacker to load a binary of their choosing.
