If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.4,"cvss-time":"2019-06-13T13:45:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-12154","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-06-13T13:45:00","references":["https://blog.gdssecurity.com/labs/2019/5/28/ssrf-and-xxe-vulnerabilities-in-pdfreactor.html","https://www.pdfreactor.com/important-pdfreactor-security-advisory/","https://www.pdfreactor.com/pdfreactor-10-maintenance-release-10-1-10722-now-available/"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://www.pdfreactor.com/important-pdfreactor-security-advisory/","https://www.pdfreactor.com/pdfreactor-10-maintenance-release-10-1-10722-now-available/"],"misc":["https://blog.gdssecurity.com/labs/2019/5/28/ssrf-and-xxe-vulnerabilities-in-pdfreactor.html"]},"summary":"XXE in the XML parser library in RealObjects PDFreactor before 10.1.10722 allows attackers to supply malicious XML content in externally referenced resources, leading to disclosure of local file contents and/or denial of service conditions.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:realobjects:pdfreactor:10.0.10702:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:realobjects:pdfreactor:10.0.10702:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:realobjects:pdfreactor:10.0.10722:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:realobjects:pdfreactor:10.0.10722:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:realobjects:pdfreactor:10.0.10722.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:realobjects:pdfreactor:10.0.10722.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:realobjects:pdfreactor:10.0.10722.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:realobjects:pdfreactor:10.0.10722.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:realobjects:pdfreactor:10.0.10722.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:realobjects:pdfreactor:10.0.10722.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:realobjects:pdfreactor:10.0.10702:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:realobjects:pdfreactor:10.0.10722:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:realobjects:pdfreactor:10.0.10722.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:realobjects:pdfreactor:10.0.10722.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:realobjects:pdfreactor:10.0.10722.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
