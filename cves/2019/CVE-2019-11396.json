When the executable loads the resource (such as an image file or configuration file) the attacker has modified the file to either execute malicious code directly or manipulate the target process (e.g. application server) to execute based on the malicious configuration parameters.

The endpoint file may be either output or input. If the file is output, the result is that the endpoint is modified, instead of a file at the intended location. Modifications to the endpoint file may include appending, overwriting, corrupting, changing permissions, or other modifications. In some variants of this attack the attacker may be able to control the change to a file while in other cases they cannot. The former is especially damaging since the attacker may be able to grant themselves increased privileges or insert false information, but the latter can also be damaging as it can expose sensitive information or corrupt or destroy vital system or application files. Alternatively, the endpoint file may serve as input to the targeted application. This can be used to feed malformed input into the target or to cause the target to process different information, possibly allowing the attacker to control the actions of the target or to cause the target to expose information to the attacker. Moreover, the actions taken on the endpoint file are undertaken with the permissions of the targeted user or application, which may exceed the permissions that the attacker would normally have."}],"cvss":7.2,"cvss-time":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-59","id":"CVE-2019-11396","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153868/Avira-Free-Security-Suite-2019-Software-Updater-2.0.6.13175-Improper-Access-Control.html","https://medium.com/sidechannel-br/vulnerabilidade-no-avira-security-suite-pode-levar-%C3%A0-escala%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-privil%C3%A9gios-no-windows-71964236c077","https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/Aug/1"],"refmap":{"fulldisc":["20190802 Avira Free Security Suite 2019 - Exploiting Arbitrary File Writes for Local Elevation of Privilege"],"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153868/Avira-Free-Security-Suite-2019-Software-Updater-2.0.6.13175-Improper-Access-Control.html","https://medium.com/sidechannel-br/vulnerabilidade-no-avira-security-suite-pode-levar-%C3%A0-escala%C3%A7%C3%A3o-de-privil%C3%A9gios-no-windows-71964236c077"]},"summary":"An issue was discovered in Avira Free Security Suite 10. The permissive access rights on the SoftwareUpdater folder (files / folders and configuration) are incompatible with the privileged file manipulation performed by the product. Files can be created that can be used by an unprivileged user to obtain SYSTEM privileges. Arbitrary file creation can be achieved by abusing the SwuConfig.json file creation: an unprivileged user can replace these files by pseudo-symbolic links to arbitrary files. When an update occurs, a privileged service creates a file and sets its access rights, offering write access to the Everyone group in any directory.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:avira:free_security_suite:2019:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:avira:free_security_suite:2019:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:avira:software_updater:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:avira:software_updater:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:avira:free_security_suite:2019:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:avira:software_updater:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
