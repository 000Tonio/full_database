If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5.5,"cvss-time":"2023-02-03T14:43:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-4208","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2023-02-03T14:43:00","references":["https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/159129","http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ibm10880263"],"refmap":{"confirm":["http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=ibm10880263"],"xf":["ibm-tririga-cve20194208-xxe (159129)"]},"summary":"IBM TRIRIGA Application Platform 3.5.3 and 3.6.0 is vulnerable to an XML External Entity Injection (XXE) attack when processing XML data.
