Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2019-0187","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","references":["http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/jmeter-user/201903.mbox/%3CCAH9fUpaUQaFbgY1Zh4OvKSL4wdvGAmVt%2Bn4fegibDoAxK5XARw%40mail.gmail.com%3E","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107219"],"refmap":{"bid":["107219"],"mlist":["[jmeter-user] 20190302 [SECURITY] CVE-2019-0187: Apache JMeter Missing client auth for RMI connection when distributed test is used"]},"summary":"Unauthenticated RCE is possible when JMeter is used in distributed mode (-r or -R command line options). Attacker can establish a RMI connection to a jmeter-server using RemoteJMeterEngine and proceed with an attack using untrusted data deserialization.
