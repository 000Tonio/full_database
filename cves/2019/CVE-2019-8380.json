A NULL pointer dereference occurs in AP4_Track::GetSampleIndexForTimeStampMs() located in Core/Ap4Track.cpp. It can triggered by sending a crafted file to the mp4audioclip binary. It allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (Segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:axiosys:bento4:1.5.1-628:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:axiosys:bento4:1.5.1-628:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:axiosys:bento4:1.5.1-628:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
