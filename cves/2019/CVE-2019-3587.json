The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:49:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2019-3587","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:49:00","references":["http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?&id=TS102887"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?&id=TS102887"]},"summary":"DLL Search Order Hijacking vulnerability in Microsoft Windows client in McAfee Total Protection (MTP) Prior to 16.0.18 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via execution from a compromised folder.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:total_protection:-:*:*:*:*:mac_os:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:total_protection:-:*:*:*:*:mac_os:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:total_protection:-:*:*:*:trial:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:total_protection:-:*:*:*:trial:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:total_protection:4.0.161.1:*:*:*:trial:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:total_protection:4.0.161.1:*:*:*:trial:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:total_protection:4.6:*:*:*:*:mac_os:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:total_protection:4.6:*:*:*:*:mac_os:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:total_protection:-:*:*:*:*:mac_os:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:total_protection:-:*:*:*:trial:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:total_protection:4.0.161.1:*:*:*:trial:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:total_protection:4.6:*:*:*:*:mac_os:*:*"]}
