The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute.

Exploitation of this preferential search order can allow an attacker to make the loading process load the adversary's rogue library rather than the legitimate library. This attack can be leveraged with many different libraries and with many different loading processes.

Specifically, when Insight Agent 2.6.3 and prior starts, the Python interpreter attempts to load python3.dll at \"C:\\DLLs\\python3.dll,\" which normally is writable by locally authenticated users. Because of this, a malicious local user could use Insight Agent's startup conditions to elevate to SYSTEM privileges. This issue was fixed in Rapid7 Insight Agent 2.6.4.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:insight_agent:2.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:insight_agent:2.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:insight_agent:2.5.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:insight_agent:2.5.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:insight_agent:2.6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:insight_agent:2.6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:insight_agent:2.6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:insight_agent:2.6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:insight_agent:2.6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:insight_agent:2.6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:insight_agent:2.6.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:insight_agent:2.6.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:insight_agent:2.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:insight_agent:2.5.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:insight_agent:2.6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:insight_agent:2.6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:insight_agent:2.6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rapid7:insight_agent:2.6.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
