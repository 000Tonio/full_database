If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2019-08-28T13:57:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-13176","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-08-28T13:57:00","references":["https://www.logicallysecure.com/blog/3cx-phone-system-web-console-affected-by-xxe/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.logicallysecure.com/blog/3cx-phone-system-web-console-affected-by-xxe/"]},"summary":"An issue was discovered in the 3CX Phone system (web) management console 12.5.44178.1002 through 12.5 SP2.
