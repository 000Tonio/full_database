In sox-fmt.h (startread function), there is an integer overflow on the result of integer addition (wraparound to 0) fed into the lsx_calloc macro that wraps malloc. When a NULL pointer is returned, it is used without a prior check that it is a valid pointer, leading to a NULL pointer dereference on lsx_readbuf in formats_i.c.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sound_exchange_project:sound_exchange:14.4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sound_exchange_project:sound_exchange:14.4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sound_exchange_project:sound_exchange:14.4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
