The attacker must defeat an encoding that is not equivalent to base64, and thus this is different from CVE-2019-13360.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:control-webpanel:webpanel:0.9.8.836:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:control-webpanel:webpanel:0.9.8.836:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:control-webpanel:webpanel:0.9.8.836:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
