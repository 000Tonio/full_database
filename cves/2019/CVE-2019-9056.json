Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2019-9056","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","references":["https://newsletter.cmsmadesimple.org/w/89247Qog4jCRCuRinvhsofwg","https://www.cmsmadesimple.org/2019/03/Announcing-CMS-Made-Simple-v2.2.10-Spuzzum"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://newsletter.cmsmadesimple.org/w/89247Qog4jCRCuRinvhsofwg","https://www.cmsmadesimple.org/2019/03/Announcing-CMS-Made-Simple-v2.2.10-Spuzzum"]},"summary":"An issue was discovered in CMS Made Simple 2.2.8.
