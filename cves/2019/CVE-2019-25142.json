This is due to 'companion_disable_popup' function only checking the nonce while sending user input to the 'update_option' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to change otherwise restricted options.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
