Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:50:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2019-5434","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:50:00","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155559/Revive-Adserver-4.2-Remote-Code-Execution.html","https://hackerone.com/reports/512076","https://hackerone.com/reports/542670","https://www.revive-adserver.com/security/revive-sa-2019-001/"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/155559/Revive-Adserver-4.2-Remote-Code-Execution.html","https://hackerone.com/reports/512076","https://hackerone.com/reports/542670","https://www.revive-adserver.com/security/revive-sa-2019-001/"]},"saint":[{"description":"Revive Adserver deserialization vulnerability","title":"revive_adserver_deserialization","type":"remote"}],"summary":"An attacker could send a specifically crafted payload to the XML-RPC invocation script and trigger the unserialize() call on the \"what\" parameter in the \"openads.spc\" RPC method. Such vulnerability could be used to perform various types of attacks, e.g. exploit serialize-related PHP vulnerabilities or PHP object injection.
