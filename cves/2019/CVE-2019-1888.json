The default security setting must be to deny access and then grant access only to those resources intended by business logic.","summary":"In applications, particularly web applications, access to functionality is mitigated by an authorization framework. This framework maps Access Control Lists (ACLs) to elements of the application's functionality; particularly URL's for web apps. In the case that the administrator failed to specify an ACL for a particular element, an attacker may be able to access it with impunity. An attacker with the ability to access functionality not properly constrained by ACLs can obtain sensitive information and possibly compromise the entire application. Such an attacker can access resources that must be available only to users at a higher privilege level, can access management sections of the application, or can run queries for data that they otherwise not supposed to."}],"cvss":9,"cvss-time":"2020-09-29T18:55:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-434","id":"CVE-2019-1888","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2020-09-29T18:55:00","references":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-uccx-privesc-Zd7bvwyf"],"refmap":{"cisco":["20200219 Cisco Unified Contact Center Express Privilege Escalation Vulnerability"]},"summary":"A vulnerability in the Administration Web Interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to upload arbitrary files and execute commands on the underlying operating system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs valid Administrator credentials. The vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions for the content uploaded to an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading arbitrary files containing operating system commands that will be executed by an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web interface and then elevate their privileges to root.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_contact_center_express:11.6\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_contact_center_express:11.6\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_contact_center_express:11.6\\(2\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_contact_center_express:11.6\\(2\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_contact_center_express:12.0\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_contact_center_express:12.0\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_ip_interactive_voice_response:11.6\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_ip_interactive_voice_response:11.6\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_ip_interactive_voice_response:11.6\\(2\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_ip_interactive_voice_response:11.6\\(2\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_contact_center_express:11.6\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_contact_center_express:11.6\\(2\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_contact_center_express:12.0\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_ip_interactive_voice_response:11.6\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_ip_interactive_voice_response:11.6\\(2\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
