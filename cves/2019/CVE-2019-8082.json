If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2019-10-28T12:48:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-8082","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-28T12:48:00","references":["https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/experience-manager/apsb19-48.html"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/experience-manager/apsb19-48.html"]},"summary":"Adobe Experience Manager versions 6.4, 6.3 and 6.2 have a xml external entity injection vulnerability.
