If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":9.4,"cvss-time":"2019-07-19T17:33:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-13625","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2019-07-19T17:33:00","references":["http://blog.fxiao.me/ghidra/","https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues/71","https://xlab.tencent.com/en/2019/03/18/ghidra-from-xxe-to-rce/"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://blog.fxiao.me/ghidra/","https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/issues/71","https://xlab.tencent.com/en/2019/03/18/ghidra-from-xxe-to-rce/"]},"summary":"NSA Ghidra before 9.0.1 allows XXE when a project is opened or restored, or a tool is imported, as demonstrated by a project.prp file.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:nsa:ghidra:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:nsa:ghidra:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:nsa:ghidra:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
