Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":9,"cvss-time":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2019-14224","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","references":["https://github.com/DrunkenShells/Disclosures/tree/master/CVE-2019-14224-Authenticated%20Remote%20Code%20Execution-Alfresco%20Community"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/DrunkenShells/Disclosures/tree/master/CVE-2019-14224-Authenticated%20Remote%20Code%20Execution-Alfresco%20Community"]},"summary":"An issue was discovered in Alfresco Community Edition 5.2 201707. By leveraging multiple components in the Alfresco Software applications, an exploit chain was observed that allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the victim machine. The attacker must upload malicious Solr configuration files and then receive a JMX connection from the victim, and serve a Java object that results in deserialization and code execution.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:alfresco:alfresco:5.2:*:*:*:community:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:alfresco:alfresco:5.2:*:*:*:community:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:alfresco:alfresco:5.2:*:*:*:community:*:*:*"]}
