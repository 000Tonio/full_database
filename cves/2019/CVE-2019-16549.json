If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2020-01-03T16:03:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-16549","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-01-03T16:03:00","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2019/12/17/1","https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-12-17/#SECURITY-1681"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2019-12-17/#SECURITY-1681"],"mlist":["[oss-security] 20191217 Multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins plugins"]},"summary":"Jenkins Maven Release Plugin 0.16.1 and earlier does not configure the XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks, allowing man-in-the-middle attackers to have Jenkins parse crafted XML documents.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:maven:0.14.0:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:maven:0.14.0:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:maven:0.16.1:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:maven:0.16.1:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:maven:0.14.0:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:maven:0.16.1:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*"]}
