NOTE: The software maintainer believes that this is not a vulnerability because running a command via sudo as a user not present in the local password database is an intentional feature. Because this behavior surprised some users, sudo 1.8.30 introduced an option to enable/disable this behavior with the default being disabled. However, this does not change the fact that sudo was behaving as intended, and as documented, in earlier versions.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sudo:sudo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sudo:sudo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sudo:sudo:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
