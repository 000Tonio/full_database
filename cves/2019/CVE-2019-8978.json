A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2021-07-21T11:39:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2019-8978","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-07-21T11:39:00","references":["https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2019/May/31","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoshuaMulliken/CVE-2019-8978/master/README.txt","https://ecommunities.ellucian.com/message/252810#252810","https://ecommunities.ellucian.com/message/252749#252749","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2019/May/18","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152856/Ellucian-Banner-Web-Tailor-Banner-Enterprise-Identity-Services-Improper-Authentication.html"],"refmap":{"bugtraq":["20190514 [CVE-2019-8978] Improper Authentication (CWE-287) in Ellucian Banner Web Tailor and Banner Enterprise Identity Services"],"fulldisc":["20190513 [CVE-2019-8978] Improper Authentication (CWE-287) in Ellucian Banner Web Tailor and Banner Enterprise Identity Services"],"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152856/Ellucian-Banner-Web-Tailor-Banner-Enterprise-Identity-Services-Improper-Authentication.html","https://ecommunities.ellucian.com/message/252749#252749","https://ecommunities.ellucian.com/message/252810#252810","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoshuaMulliken/CVE-2019-8978/master/README.txt"]},"summary":"An improper authentication vulnerability can be exploited through a race condition that occurs in Ellucian Banner Web Tailor 8.8.3, 8.8.4, and 8.9 and Banner Enterprise Identity Services 8.3, 8.3.1, 8.3.2, and 8.4, in conjunction with SSO Manager. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to steal a victim's session (and cause a denial of service) by repeatedly requesting the initial Banner Web Tailor main page with the IDMSESSID cookie set to the victim's UDCID, which in the case tested is the institutional ID. During a login attempt by a victim, the attacker can leverage the race condition and will be issued the SESSID that was meant for this victim.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ellucian:banner_enterprise_identity_services:8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ellucian:banner_enterprise_identity_services:8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ellucian:banner_enterprise_identity_services:8.3.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ellucian:banner_enterprise_identity_services:8.3.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ellucian:banner_enterprise_identity_services:8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ellucian:banner_enterprise_identity_services:8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ellucian:banner_web_tailor:8.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ellucian:banner_web_tailor:8.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ellucian:banner_web_tailor:8.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ellucian:banner_web_tailor:8.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ellucian:banner_web_tailor:8.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ellucian:banner_web_tailor:8.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ellucian:banner_enterprise_identity_services:8.3.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ellucian:banner_enterprise_identity_services:8.3.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:ellucian:banner_enterprise_identity_services:8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ellucian:banner_enterprise_identity_services:8.3.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ellucian:banner_enterprise_identity_services:8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ellucian:banner_web_tailor:8.8.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ellucian:banner_web_tailor:8.8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ellucian:banner_web_tailor:8.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ellucian:banner_enterprise_identity_services:8.3.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
