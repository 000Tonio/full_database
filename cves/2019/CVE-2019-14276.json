If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2019-10-30T17:11:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-14276","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-30T17:11:00","references":["http://www.senseofsecurity.com.au/research/it-security-advisories.php","https://wiki.xnat.org/documentation/getting-started-with-xnat/what-s-new-in-xnat/xnat-1-7-5-4-1-7-5-6-release-notes","https://www.senseofsecurity.com.au/advisories/SOS-19-001"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://www.senseofsecurity.com.au/research/it-security-advisories.php","https://wiki.xnat.org/documentation/getting-started-with-xnat/what-s-new-in-xnat/xnat-1-7-5-4-1-7-5-6-release-notes","https://www.senseofsecurity.com.au/advisories/SOS-19-001"]},"summary":"WUSTL XNAT 1.7.5.3 allows XXE attacks via a POST request body.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:xnat:xnat:1.7.5.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:xnat:xnat:1.7.5.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:xnat:xnat:1.7.5.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
