If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2019-05-10T19:29:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-7442","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-05-10T19:29:00","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152801/CyberArk-Enterprise-Password-Vault-10.7-XML-External-Entity-Injection.html","https://www.octority.com/2019/05/07/cyberark-enterprise-password-vault-xml-external-entity-xxe-injection/"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152801/CyberArk-Enterprise-Password-Vault-10.7-XML-External-Entity-Injection.html","https://www.octority.com/2019/05/07/cyberark-enterprise-password-vault-xml-external-entity-xxe-injection/"]},"summary":"An XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in the Password Vault Web Access (PVWA) of CyberArk Enterprise Password Vault <=10.7 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files or potentially bypass authentication via a crafted DTD in the SAML authentication system.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cyberark:enterprise_password_vault:10.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cyberark:enterprise_password_vault:10.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cyberark:enterprise_password_vault:10.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cyberark:enterprise_password_vault:10.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:cyberark:enterprise_password_vault:10.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cyberark:enterprise_password_vault:10.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
