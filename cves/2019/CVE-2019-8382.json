A NULL pointer dereference occurs in the function AP4_List:Find located in Core/Ap4List.h when called from Core/Ap4Movie.cpp. It can be triggered by sending a crafted file to the mp4dump binary. It allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (Segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:axiosys:bento4:1.5.1-628:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:axiosys:bento4:1.5.1-628:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:axiosys:bento4:1.5.1-628:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
