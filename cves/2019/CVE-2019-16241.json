The System application that implements the lock screen checks for the existence of a specific file and disables PIN authentication if it exists. This file would typically be created via Android Debug Bridge (adb) over USB.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:alcatelmobile:cingular_flip_2_firmware:b9huah1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:alcatelmobile:cingular_flip_2_firmware:b9huah1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:alcatelmobile:cingularl_flip_2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:alcatelmobile:cingularl_flip_2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:alcatelmobile:cingular_flip_2_firmware:b9huah1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
