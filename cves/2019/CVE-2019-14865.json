That is, when the target copies data to the clipboard (e.g., to paste into another application), the adversary needs some means of capturing that data in a third location.","related_weakness":["267"],"solutions":"While copying and pasting of data with the clipboard is a legitimate and practical function, certain situations and context may require the disabling of this feature. Just as certain applications disable screenshot capability, applications that handle highly sensitive information should consider disabling copy and paste functionality. Employ a robust identification and audit/blocking via whitelisting of applications on your system. Malware may contain the functionality associated with this attack pattern.","summary":"The adversary exploits an application that allows for the copying of sensitive data or information by collecting information copied to the clipboard. Data copied to the clipboard can be accessed by other applications, such as malware built to exfiltrate or log clipboard contents on a periodic basis.

Strict interpretation of HTTP get methods means that these HTTP Get services should not be used to delete information on the server, but there is no access control mechanism to back up this logic. This means that unless the services are properly ACL'd and the application's service implementation are following these guidelines then an HTTP request can easily execute a delete or update on the server side. The attacker identifies a HTTP Get URL such as http://victimsite/updateOrder, which calls out to a program to update orders on a database or other resource. The URL is not idempotent so the request can be submitted multiple times by the attacker, additionally, the attacker may be able to exploit the URL published as a Get method that actually performs updates (instead of merely retrieving data). This may result in malicious or inadvertent altering of data on the server."},{"id":"648","name":"Collect Data from Screen Capture","prerequisites":"The adversary must have obtained logical access to the system by some means (e.g., via obtained credentials or planting malware on the system).","related_weakness":["267"],"solutions":"Identify potentially malicious software that may have functionality to acquire screen captures, and audit and/or block it by using whitelisting tools.
