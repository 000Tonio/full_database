By attaching a UART adapter to the UART pins on the system board, an attacker can use a special key sequence (Ctrl-\\) to obtain a shell with root privileges. After gaining root access, the attacker can mount the filesystem read-write and make permanent modifications to the device including bricking of the device, disabling vendor management of the device, preventing automatic upgrades, and permanently installing malicious code on the device.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:actiontec:t2200h_firmware:t2200h-31.1238l.08:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:actiontec:t2200h_firmware:t2200h-31.1238l.08:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:actiontec:t2200h:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:actiontec:t2200h:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:actiontec:t2200h_firmware:t2200h-31.1238l.08:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
