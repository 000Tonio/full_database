If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2020-01-13T18:28:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-20153","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-01-13T18:28:00","references":["https://www.n00py.io/2020/01/zero-day-exploit-in-determine-selectica-contract-lifecycle-management-sclm-v5-4/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.n00py.io/2020/01/zero-day-exploit-in-determine-selectica-contract-lifecycle-management-sclm-v5-4/"]},"summary":"An issue was discovered in Determine (formerly Selectica) Contract Lifecycle Management (CLM) in v5.4.
