If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2020-01-07T15:20:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-19998","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-01-07T15:20:00","references":["https://gitee.com/xiuno/xiunobbs/issues/I177MY"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://gitee.com/xiuno/xiunobbs/issues/I177MY"]},"summary":"Xiuno BBS 4.0 allows XXE via plugin/xn_wechat_public/route/token.php.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:xiuno:xiunobbs:4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:xiuno:xiunobbs:4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:xiuno:xiunobbs:4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
