Implementation: Perform testing such as pen-testing and vulnerability scanning to identify directories, programs, and interfaces that grant direct access to executables.","summary":"An attacker manipulates inputs to the target software which the target software passes to file system calls in the OS.

Implementation: Use possible permissions on file access when developing and deploying web applications.","summary":"An attacker exploits a weakness in input validation on the target by supplying a specially constructed path utilizing dot and slash characters for the purpose of obtaining access to arbitrary files or resources. An attacker modifies a known path on the target in order to reach material that is not available through intended channels. These attacks normally involve adding additional path separators (/ or \\) and/or dots (.), or encodings thereof, in various combinations in order to reach parent directories or entirely separate trees of the target's directory structure."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2021-04-22T21:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-23","id":"CVE-2019-18338","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-04-22T21:15:00","references":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-761617.pdf","https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-761844.pdf"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-761617.pdf"]},"summary":"A vulnerability has been identified in Control Center Server (CCS) (All versions < V1.5.0).
