Manual intervention may be required before a device will resume normal operations. The vulnerability is due to a logic error in the FPGA related to the processing of different types of input packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by being on the adjacent subnet and sending a crafted sequence of input packets to a specific interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a queue wedge condition on the interface. When a wedge occurs, the affected device will stop processing any additional packets that are received on the wedged interface. Version 2.2 is affected.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:firepower_9000_firmware:2.2\\(200.8\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:firepower_9000_firmware:2.2\\(200.8\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:cisco:firepower_9000:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:cisco:firepower_9000:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:cisco:firepower_9000_firmware:2.2\\(200.8\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
