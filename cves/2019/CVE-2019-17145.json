User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the conversion of DXF files to PDF. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-9276.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:foxitsoftware:phantompdf:9.6.0.25114:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:foxitsoftware:phantompdf:9.6.0.25114:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:foxitsoftware:phantompdf:9.6.0.25114:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
