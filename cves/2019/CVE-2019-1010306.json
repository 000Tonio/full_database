Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2019-1010306","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","references":["https://github.com/stevegraham/slanger/pull/238/commits/5267b455caeb2e055cccf0d2b6a22727c111f5c3"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/stevegraham/slanger/pull/238/commits/5267b455caeb2e055cccf0d2b6a22727c111f5c3"]},"summary":"Slanger 0.6.0 is affected by: Remote Code Execution (RCE).
