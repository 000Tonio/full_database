The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":9.3,"cvss-time":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2019-13637","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","references":["https://github.com/active-labs/Advisories/blob/master/ACTIVE-2019-009.md"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/active-labs/Advisories/blob/master/ACTIVE-2019-009.md"]},"summary":"In LogMeIn join.me before 3.16.0.5505, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on a targeted system. This vulnerability is due to unsafe search paths used by the application URI that is defined in Windows. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a targeted user to follow a malicious link. Successful exploitation could cause the application to load libraries from the directory targeted by the URI link. The attacker could use this behavior to execute arbitrary commands on the system with the privileges of the targeted user if the attacker can place a crafted library in a directory that is accessible to the vulnerable system.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:logmeininc:join.me:3.4.0.5369:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:logmeininc:join.me:3.4.0.5369:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:logmeininc:join.me:3.8.1.5397:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:logmeininc:join.me:3.8.1.5397:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:logmeininc:join.me:3.9.0.5408:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:logmeininc:join.me:3.9.0.5408:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:logmeininc:join.me:3.10.2.5456:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:logmeininc:join.me:3.10.2.5456:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:logmeininc:join.me:3.11.1.5472:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:logmeininc:join.me:3.11.1.5472:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:logmeininc:join.me:3.4.0.5369:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:logmeininc:join.me:3.8.1.5397:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:logmeininc:join.me:3.9.0.5408:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:logmeininc:join.me:3.10.2.5456:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:logmeininc:join.me:3.11.1.5472:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*"]}
