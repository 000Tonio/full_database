Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2019-06-18T20:12:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2019-12868","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-06-18T20:12:00","references":["https://github.com/MISP/MISP/commit/c42c5fe92783dd306b7600db1f6a25324445b40c"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/MISP/MISP/commit/c42c5fe92783dd306b7600db1f6a25324445b40c"]},"summary":"app/Model/Server.php in MISP 2.4.109 allows remote command execution by a super administrator because the PHP file_exists function is used with user-controlled entries, and phar:// URLs trigger deserialization.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:misp:misp:2.4.109:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:misp:misp:2.4.109:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:misp:misp:2.4.109:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
