One is able to bypass Ivanti's FileGuard folder protection by renaming the WMTemp work folder used by PowerGrid. A malicious PowerGrid XML file can then be created, after which the folder is renamed back to its original value. Also, CVE-2018-15591 exploitation can consequently be achieved by using PowerGrid with the /SEE parameter to execute the arbitrary command specified in the XML file.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ivanti:workspace_control:10.3.110.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ivanti:workspace_control:10.3.110.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:ivanti:workspace_control:10.3.110.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
