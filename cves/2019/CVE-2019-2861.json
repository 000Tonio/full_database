If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":2.1,"cvss-time":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-2861","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-08-24T17:37:00","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153841/Oracle-Hyperion-Planning-11.1.2.3-XML-Injection.html","http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2019-5072835.html"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/153841/Oracle-Hyperion-Planning-11.1.2.3-XML-Injection.html","http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujul2019-5072835.html"]},"summary":"Vulnerability in the Oracle Hyperion Planning component of Oracle Hyperion (subcomponent: Security).
