A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":6,"cvss-time":"2020-01-03T22:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2019-19580","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-01-03T22:15:00","references":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-01/msg00011.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/34HBFTYNMQMWIO2GGK7DB6KV4M6R5YPV/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/D5R73AYE53QA32KTMHUVKCX6E52CIS43/","https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2020/Jan/21","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202003-56","https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4602","https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-310.html"],"refmap":{"bugtraq":["20200114 [SECURITY] [DSA 4602-1] xen security update"],"debian":["DSA-4602"],"fedora":["FEDORA-2019-2e12bd3a9a","FEDORA-2019-6aad703290"],"gentoo":["GLSA-202003-56"],"misc":["https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-310.html"],"suse":["openSUSE-SU-2020:0011"]},"summary":"An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.12.x allowing x86 PV guest OS users to gain host OS privileges by leveraging race conditions in pagetable promotion and demotion operations, because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-18421. XSA-299 addressed several critical issues in restartable PV type change operations. Despite extensive testing and auditing, some corner cases were missed. A malicious PV guest administrator may be able to escalate their privilege to that of the host. All security-supported versions of Xen are vulnerable. Only x86 systems are affected. Arm systems are not affected. Only x86 PV guests can leverage the vulnerability. x86 HVM and PVH guests cannot leverage the vulnerability. Note that these attacks require very precise timing, which may be difficult to exploit in practice.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:4.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:x86:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:4.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:x86:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:31:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:31:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:4.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:x86:*","cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:31:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
