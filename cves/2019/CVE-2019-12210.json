This leads to the file descriptor being inherited into the child process; the child process can then read from and write to it. This can leak sensitive information and also, if written to, be used to fill the disk or plant misinformation.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:yubico:pam-u2f:1.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:yubico:pam-u2f:1.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:yubico:pam-u2f:1.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
