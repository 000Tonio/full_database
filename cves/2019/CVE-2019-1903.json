If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.4,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:48:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-1903","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:48:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/108857","https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20190619-csm-xml"],"refmap":{"bid":["108857"],"cisco":["20190619 Cisco Security Manager XML Entity Expansion Vulnerability"]},"summary":"A vulnerability in Cisco Security Manager could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper restrictions on XML entities. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to a targeted system that contain references within XML entities. An exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information, or cause the application to consume available resources, resulting in a DoS condition.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:security_manager:4.14:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:security_manager:4.14:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:cisco:security_manager:4.14:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
