If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":3.6,"cvss-time":"2019-04-11T19:49:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-0284","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-04-11T19:49:00","references":["https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2772376","https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=517899114"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2772376","https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=517899114"]},"summary":"SLD Registration in SAP HANA (fixed in versions 1.0, 2.0) does not sufficiently validate an XML document accepted from an untrusted source.
