This denial of service attack requires substantially fewer packets to be sent which makes DoS harder to detect. This is an equivalent of SYN flood in HTTP. The idea is to keep the HTTP session alive indefinitely and then repeat that hundreds of times. This attack targets resource depletion weaknesses in web server software. The web server will wait to attacker's responses on the initiated HTTP sessions while the connection threads are being exhausted."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2021-07-21T11:39:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-772","id":"CVE-2019-20052","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-07-21T11:39:00","references":["https://github.com/tbeu/matio/issues/131"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/tbeu/matio/issues/131"]},"summary":"A memory leak was discovered in Mat_VarCalloc in mat.c in matio 1.5.17 because SafeMulDims does not consider the rank==0 case.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:matio_project:matio:1.5.17:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:matio_project:matio:1.5.17:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:matio_project:matio:1.5.17:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
