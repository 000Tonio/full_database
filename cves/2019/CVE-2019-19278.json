The adversary can leverage a race condition by \"running the race\", modifying the resource and modifying the normal execution flow. For instance, a race condition can occur while accessing a file: the adversary can trick the system by replacing the original file with his version and cause the system to read the malicious file."},{"id":"29","name":"Leveraging Time-of-Check and Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Conditions","prerequisites":"A resource is access/modified concurrently by multiple processes.

A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":7.2,"cvss-time":"2021-11-03T16:57:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2019-19278","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2021-11-03T16:57:00","references":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-242353.pdf","https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-014-04"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-242353.pdf"],"misc":["https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-014-04"]},"summary":"A vulnerability has been identified in SINAMICS PERFECT HARMONY GH180 Drives MLFB 6SR32..-.....-....

(High Availability) (All versions). The affected device contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to restore the affected device to a point where predefined application and operating system protection mechanisms are not in place. Successful exploitation requires physical access to the system, but no system privileges and no user interaction. An attacker could use the vulnerability to compromise confidentialiy, integrity and availability of the device. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:siemens:sinamics_perfect_harmony_gh180_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:siemens:sinamics_perfect_harmony_gh180_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:siemens:sinamics_perfect_harmony_gh180:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:siemens:sinamics_perfect_harmony_gh180:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:siemens:sinamics_perfect_harmony_gh180_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
