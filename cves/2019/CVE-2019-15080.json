A typo in the constructor of the Owned contract (which is inherited by MORPH Token) allows attackers to acquire contract ownership. A new owner can subsequently obtain MORPH Tokens for free and can perform a DoS attack.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:morph_project:morph:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:morph_project:morph:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:morph_project:morph:2019-06-05:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:morph_project:morph:2019-06-05:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:morph_project:morph:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:morph_project:morph:2019-06-05:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
