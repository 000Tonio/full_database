Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2019-08-23T02:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2019-12240","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-08-23T02:15:00","references":["https://dumpco.re/bugs/wp-plugin-virim-id","https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/9291"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://dumpco.re/bugs/wp-plugin-virim-id","https://wpvulndb.com/vulnerabilities/9291"]},"summary":"The Virim plugin 0.4 for WordPress allows Insecure Deserialization via s_values, t_values, or c_values in graph.php.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:virim_project:virim:0.4:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:virim_project:virim:0.4:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:virim_project:virim:0.4:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"]}
