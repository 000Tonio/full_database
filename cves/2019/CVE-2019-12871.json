A manipulated PC Worx or Config+ project file could lead to a Use-After-Free and remote code execution. The attacker needs to get access to an original PC Worx or Config+ project file to be able to manipulate it. After manipulation, the attacker needs to exchange the original file with the manipulated one on the application programming workstation.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:phoenixcontact:automationworx_software_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:phoenixcontact:automationworx_software_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:phoenixcontact:automationworx_software_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
