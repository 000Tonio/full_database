If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2019-04-02T16:22:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2019-8997","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-04-02T16:22:00","references":["http://support.blackberry.com/kb/articleDetail?articleNumber=000047227"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://support.blackberry.com/kb/articleDetail?articleNumber=000047227"]},"summary":"An XML External Entity Injection (XXE) vulnerability in the Management System (console) of BlackBerry AtHoc versions earlier than 7.6 HF-567 could allow an attacker to potentially read arbitrary local files from the application server or make requests on the network by entering maliciously crafted XML in an existing field.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blackberry:athoc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blackberry:athoc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:blackberry:athoc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
