NOTE: this issue has been SPLIT from CVE-2007-6755 because the vendor announcement did not state a specific technical rationale for a change in the algorithm; thus, CVE cannot reach a conclusion that a CVE-2007-6755 concern was the reason, or one of the reasons, for this change. As with CVE-2007-6755 this vulnerability has been scored with the assumption the relationship between P and Q is known to the attacker.
