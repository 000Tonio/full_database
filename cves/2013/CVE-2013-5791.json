NOTE: the previous information is from the October 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from a third party that the issue is a stack-based buffer overflow in the Microsoft Access 1.x parser in vsacs.dll before 8.4.0.108 and before 8.4.1.52, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long field (aka column) name. Per http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpuoct2013-1899837.html\n\n'Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). It does not have any particular associated protocol. If the hosting software passes data received over the network to Outside In Technology code, the CVSS Base Score would increase to 6.8.'","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:oracle:fusion_middleware:8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:oracle:fusion_middleware:8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:oracle:fusion_middleware:8.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:oracle:fusion_middleware:8.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:oracle:fusion_middleware:8.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:oracle:fusion_middleware:8.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
