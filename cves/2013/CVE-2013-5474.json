The adversary can leverage a race condition by \"running the race\", modifying the resource and modifying the normal execution flow. For instance, a race condition can occur while accessing a file: the adversary can trick the system by replacing the original file with his version and cause the system to read the malicious file."},{"id":"29","name":"Leveraging Time-of-Check and Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Conditions","prerequisites":"A resource is access/modified concurrently by multiple processes.

A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":7.8,"cvss-time":"2013-10-07T20:11:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2013-5474","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2013-10-07T20:11:00","references":["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20130925-ipv6vfr"],"refmap":{"cisco":["20130925 Cisco IOS Software IPv6 Virtual Fragmentation Reassembly Denial of Service Vulnerability"]},"summary":"Race condition in the IPv6 virtual fragmentation reassembly (VFR) implementation in Cisco IOS 12.2 through 12.4 and 15.0 through 15.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device reload or hang) via fragmented IPv6 packets, aka Bug ID CSCud64812.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:12.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:12.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:12.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:12.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:12.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:12.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:12.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:12.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:12.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
