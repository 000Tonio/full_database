The adversary can leverage a race condition by \"running the race\", modifying the resource and modifying the normal execution flow. For instance, a race condition can occur while accessing a file: the adversary can trick the system by replacing the original file with his version and cause the system to read the malicious file."},{"id":"29","name":"Leveraging Time-of-Check and Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Conditions","prerequisites":"A resource is access/modified concurrently by multiple processes.

A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":4.9,"cvss-time":"2018-10-12T22:04:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2013-1284","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2018-10-12T22:04:00","msbulletin":[{"bulletin_id":"MS13-031","bulletin_url":null,"date":"2013-04-09T00:00:00","impact":"Elevation of Privilege","knowledgebase_id":"2813170","knowledgebase_url":null,"severity":"Important","title":"Vulnerabilities in Windows Kernel Could Allow Elevation of Privilege"}],"oval":[{"accepted":"2013-05-27T04:00:08.505-04:00","class":"vulnerability","contributors":[{"name":"SecPod Team","organization":"SecPod Technologies"}],"definition_extensions":[{"comment":"Microsoft Windows 8 is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:15732"},{"comment":"Microsoft Windows Server 2012 is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:16359"}],"description":"Race condition in the kernel in Microsoft Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, and Windows RT allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted application that leverages improper handling of objects in memory, aka \"Kernel Race Condition Vulnerability.\"","family":"windows","id":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:16455","status":"accepted","submitted":"2013-04-12T15:29:18","title":"Kernel Race Condition Vulnerability - CVE-2013-1284 (MS13-031)","version":"75"}],"references":["http://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-100A","https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2013/ms13-031","https://oval.cisecurity.org/repository/search/definition/oval%3Aorg.mitre.oval%3Adef%3A16455"],"refmap":{"cert":["TA13-100A"]},"summary":"Race condition in the kernel in Microsoft Windows 8, Windows Server 2012, and Windows RT allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted application that leverages improper handling of objects in memory, aka \"Kernel Race Condition Vulnerability.\" Per: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms13-031\r\n\r\n\"What might an attacker use the vulnerability to do? \r\nAn attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain elevated privileges and read arbitrary amounts of kernel memory.\"","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_8:-:-:x64:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_8:-:-:x64:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_8:-:-:x86:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_8:-:-:x86:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_rt:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_rt:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2012:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2012:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_8:-:-:x64:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_8:-:-:x86:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_rt:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2012:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
