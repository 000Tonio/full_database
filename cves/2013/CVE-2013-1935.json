The adversary can leverage a race condition by \"running the race\", modifying the resource and modifying the normal execution flow.

A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":5.7,"cvss-time":"2019-04-22T17:48:00","cvss-vector":"AV:A/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2013-1935","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-04-22T17:48:00","redhat":{"advisories":[{"rhsa":{"id":"RHSA-2013:0907"}},{"rhsa":{"id":"RHSA-2013:0911"}}],"rpms":["rhev-hypervisor6-0:6.4-20130528.0.el6_4","kernel-0:2.6.32-358.11.1.el6","kernel-bootwrapper-0:2.6.32-358.11.1.el6","kernel-debug-0:2.6.32-358.11.1.el6","kernel-debug-debuginfo-0:2.6.32-358.11.1.el6","kernel-debug-devel-0:2.6.32-358.11.1.el6","kernel-debuginfo-0:2.6.32-358.11.1.el6","kernel-debuginfo-common-i686-0:2.6.32-358.11.1.el6","kernel-debuginfo-common-ppc64-0:2.6.32-358.11.1.el6","kernel-debuginfo-common-s390x-0:2.6.32-358.11.1.el6","kernel-debuginfo-common-x86_64-0:2.6.32-358.11.1.el6","kernel-devel-0:2.6.32-358.11.1.el6","kernel-doc-0:2.6.32-358.11.1.el6","kernel-firmware-0:2.6.32-358.11.1.el6","kernel-headers-0:2.6.32-358.11.1.el6","kernel-kdump-0:2.6.32-358.11.1.el6","kernel-kdump-debuginfo-0:2.6.32-358.11.1.el6","kernel-kdump-devel-0:2.6.32-358.11.1.el6","perf-0:2.6.32-358.11.1.el6","perf-debuginfo-0:2.6.32-358.11.1.el6","python-perf-0:2.6.32-358.11.1.el6","python-perf-debuginfo-0:2.6.32-358.11.1.el6"]},"references":["http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0911.html","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=949981","https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2013-0907.html"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=949981"]},"summary":"A certain Red Hat patch to the KVM subsystem in the kernel package before 2.6.32-358.11.1.el6 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 does not properly implement the PV EOI feature, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) by leveraging a time window during which interrupts are disabled but copy_to_user function calls are possible.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:redhat:enterprise_linux:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
