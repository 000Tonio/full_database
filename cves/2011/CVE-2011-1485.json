A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":6.9,"cvss-time":"2012-12-19T04:39:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2011-1485","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2012-12-19T04:39:00","redhat":{"advisories":[{"bugzilla":{"id":"692922","title":"CVE-2011-1485 polkit: polkitd/pkexec vulnerability"},"oval":{"OR":[{"comment":"Red Hat Enterprise Linux must be installed","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhba:tst:20070304026"},{"AND":[{"comment":"Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is installed","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhba:tst:20111656003"},{"OR":[{"AND":[{"comment":"polkit is earlier than 0:0.96-2.el6_0.1","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20110455001"},{"comment":"polkit is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease2 key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20110455002"}]},{"AND":[{"comment":"polkit-desktop-policy is earlier than 0:0.96-2.el6_0.1","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20110455003"},{"comment":"polkit-desktop-policy is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease2 key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20110455004"}]},{"AND":[{"comment":"polkit-devel is earlier than 0:0.96-2.el6_0.1","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20110455005"},{"comment":"polkit-devel is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease2 key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20110455006"}]},{"AND":[{"comment":"polkit-docs is earlier than 0:0.96-2.el6_0.1","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20110455007"},{"comment":"polkit-docs is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease2 key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20110455008"}]}]}]}]},"rhsa":{"id":"RHSA-2011:0455","released":"2011-04-19","severity":"Important","title":"RHSA-2011:0455: polkit security update (Important)"}}],"rpms":["polkit-0:0.96-2.el6_0.1","polkit-debuginfo-0:0.96-2.el6_0.1","polkit-desktop-policy-0:0.96-2.el6_0.1","polkit-devel-0:0.96-2.el6_0.1","polkit-docs-0:0.96-2.el6_0.1"]},"references":["http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2011-April/058752.html","http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2011-May/059859.html","http://secunia.com/advisories/48817","http://security.gentoo.org/glsa/glsa-201204-06.xml","http://securityreason.com/securityalert/8424","http://www.debian.org/security/2011/dsa-2319","http://www.mandriva.com/security/advisories?name=MDVSA-2011:086","http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2011-0455.html","http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/USN-1117-1","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=692922"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=692922"],"debian":["DSA-2319"],"fedora":["FEDORA-2011-5589","FEDORA-2011-5676"],"gentoo":["GLSA-201204-06"],"mandriva":["MDVSA-2011:086"],"secunia":["48817"],"sreason":["8424"],"ubuntu":["USN-1117-1"]},"summary":"Race condition in the pkexec utility and polkitd daemon in PolicyKit (aka polkit) 0.96 allows local users to gain privileges by executing a setuid program from pkexec, related to the use of the effective user ID instead of the real user ID.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:redhat:policykit:0.96:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:redhat:policykit:0.96:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:redhat:policykit:0.96:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
