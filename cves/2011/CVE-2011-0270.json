Most applications assume that users will provide static text and may respond unpredictably to the presence of formatting character. For example, in certain functions of the C programming languages such as printf, the formatting character %s will print the contents of a memory location expecting this location to identify a string and the formatting character %n prints the number of DWORD written in the memory. An adversary can use this to read or write to memory locations or files, or simply to manipulate the value of the resulting text in unexpected ways. Reading or writing memory may result in program crashes and writing memory could result in the execution of arbitrary code if the adversary can write to the program stack."}],"cvss":10,"cvss-time":"2017-08-17T01:33:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-134","id":"CVE-2011-0270","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2017-08-17T01:33:00","references":["http://osvdb.org/70474","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/515628","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/45762","http://www.securitytracker.com/id?1024951","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2011/0085","http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-012/","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/64646"],"refmap":{"bid":["45762"],"hp":["HPSBMA02621","SSRT100352"],"misc":["http://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-11-012/"],"osvdb":["70474"],"sectrack":["1024951"],"vupen":["ADV-2011-0085"],"xf":["hp-opennnm-nnmrptconfig-format-string(64646)"]},"saint":[{"bid":"45762","description":"HP OpenView Network Node Manager nnmRptConfig.exe schd_select1 Remote Code Execution","id":"net_ovnodemgrnnmrptconfigbo","osvdb":"70473","title":"openview_nnm_nnmrptconfig_schdselect","type":"remote"},{"bid":"45762","description":"HP OpenView Network Node Manager ovwebsnmpsrv.exe ovutil.dll stringToSeconds Buffer Overflow","id":"net_ovnodemgrnnmrptconfigbo","osvdb":"70470","title":"openview_nnm_ovwebsnmpsrv_stringtoseconds","type":"remote"},{"bid":"45762","description":"HP OpenView Network Node Manager malformed displayWidth option to jovgraph.exe","id":"net_ovnodemgrnnmrptconfigbo","osvdb":"70469","title":"openview_nnm_jovgraph_displaywidth","type":"remote"},{"bid":"45762","description":"HP OpenView Network Node Manager nnmRptConfig.exe nameParams text1 Buffer Overflow","id":"net_ovnodemgrnnmrptconfigbo","osvdb":"70473","title":"openview_nnm_nnmrptconfig_nameparams","type":"remote"}],"summary":"Format string vulnerability in nnmRptConfig.exe in HP OpenView Network Node Manager (OV NNM) 7.51 and 7.53 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in input data that involves an invalid template name.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:hp:openview_network_node_manager:7.51:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:hp:openview_network_node_manager:7.51:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:hp:openview_network_node_manager:7.53:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:hp:openview_network_node_manager:7.53:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:hp:openview_network_node_manager:7.51:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:hp:openview_network_node_manager:7.53:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
