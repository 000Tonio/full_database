The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":9.3,"cvss-time":"2018-05-23T16:46:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2011-5158","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2018-05-23T16:46:00","references":["http://secunia.com/advisories/42940","http://sotiriu.de/adv/NSOADV-2010-010.txt"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://sotiriu.de/adv/NSOADV-2010-010.txt"],"secunia":["42940"]},"summary":"Multiple untrusted search path vulnerabilities in the DMTGUI2.EXE and DvInesLogFileViewer.Exe components in DATEV Grundpaket Basis CD23.20 allow local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse (1) DVBSKNLANG101.dll or (2) DvZediTermSrvInfo004.dll file in the current working directory, as demonstrated by a directory that contains a .dmt, .adl, .c02, .dof, or .jrf file.
