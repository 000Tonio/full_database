A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":5.4,"cvss-time":"2012-03-15T04:00:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2011-1625","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2012-03-15T04:00:00","references":["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/cable/cmts/release/notes/12_2sc/uBR7200/122_33_SCF/caveats.html"],"refmap":{"confirm":["http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/cable/cmts/release/notes/12_2sc/uBR7200/122_33_SCF/caveats.html"]},"summary":"Cisco IOS 12.2, 12.3, 12.4, 15.0, and 15.1, when the data-link switching (DLSw) feature is configured, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device crash) by sending a sequence of malformed packets and leveraging a \"narrow timing window,\" aka Bug ID CSCtf74999, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-0199, CVE-2008-1152, and CVE-2009-0629.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:12.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:12.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:12.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:12.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:12.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:12.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:12.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:12.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:12.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios:15.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
