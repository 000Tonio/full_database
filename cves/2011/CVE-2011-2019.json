The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":9.3,"cvss-time":"2022-03-01T14:50:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2011-2019","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2022-03-01T14:50:00","msbulletin":[{"bulletin_id":"MS11-099","bulletin_url":null,"date":"2011-12-13T00:00:00","impact":"Remote Code Execution","knowledgebase_id":"2618444","knowledgebase_url":null,"severity":"Important","title":"Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer"}],"oval":[{"accepted":"2014-08-18T04:00:47.347-04:00","class":"vulnerability","contributors":[{"name":"Dragos Prisaca","organization":"Symantec Corporation"},{"name":"Maria Mikhno","organization":"ALTX-SOFT"}],"definition_extensions":[{"comment":"Microsoft Windows 7 (32-bit) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:6165"},{"comment":"Microsoft Windows 7 x64 Edition is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:5950"},{"comment":"Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 x64 Edition is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:6438"},{"comment":"Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:11985"}],"description":"Untrusted search path vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 on Windows Server 2008 R2 and R2 SP1 and Windows 7 Gold and SP1 allows local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse DLL in the current working directory, as demonstrated by a directory that contains an HTML file, aka \"Internet Explorer Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability.\"","family":"windows","id":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:13884","status":"accepted","submitted":"2011-12-13T13:00:00","title":"Internet Explorer Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability","version":"77"}],"references":["http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/techalerts/TA11-347A.html","https://oval.cisecurity.org/repository/search/definition/oval%3Aorg.mitre.oval%3Adef%3A13884","https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2011/ms11-099"],"refmap":{"cert":["TA11-347A"]},"summary":"Untrusted search path vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 on Windows Server 2008 R2 and R2 SP1 and Windows 7 Gold and SP1 allows local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse DLL in the current working directory, as demonstrated by a directory that contains an HTML file, aka \"Internet Explorer Insecure Library Loading Vulnerability.\"","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_7:-:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_7:-:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2008:r2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2008:r2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2008:r2:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2008:r2:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
