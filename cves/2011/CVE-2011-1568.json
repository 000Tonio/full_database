Strong input validation - All user-controllable input must be validated and filtered for illegal formatting characters.","summary":"An adversary includes formatting characters in a string input field on the target application. Most applications assume that users will provide static text and may respond unpredictably to the presence of formatting character. For example, in certain functions of the C programming languages such as printf, the formatting character %s will print the contents of a memory location expecting this location to identify a string and the formatting character %n prints the number of DWORD written in the memory. An adversary can use this to read or write to memory locations or files, or simply to manipulate the value of the resulting text in unexpected ways. Reading or writing memory may result in program crashes and writing memory could result in the execution of arbitrary code if the adversary can write to the program stack."}],"cvss":10,"cvss-time":"2011-09-22T03:30:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-134","id":"CVE-2011-1568","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2011-09-22T03:30:00","references":["http://aluigi.org/adv/igss_6-adv.txt","http://secunia.com/advisories/43849","http://securityreason.com/securityalert/8182","http://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/17024","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/46936","http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICS-ALERT-11-080-03.pdf","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2011/0741"],"refmap":{"bid":["46936"],"exploit-db":["17024"],"misc":["http://aluigi.org/adv/igss_6-adv.txt","http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICS-ALERT-11-080-03.pdf"],"secunia":["43849"],"sreason":["8182"],"vupen":["ADV-2011-0741"]},"saint":[{"bid":"46936","description":"7T Interactive Graphical SCADA System dc.exe Directory Traversal","id":"misc_igssscadabo","osvdb":"72349","title":"7t_igss_dcexe_directory_traversal","type":"remote"},{"bid":"46936","description":"7-Technologies Interactive Graphical SCADA System Remote Code Execution","id":"misc_igssscadabo","title":"7t_igss_rce","type":"remote"}],"summary":"Format string vulnerability in the logText function in shmemmgr9.dll in IGSSdataServer.exe 9.00.00.11074, and 9.00.00.11063 and earlier, in 7-Technologies Interactive Graphical SCADA System (IGSS) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code, as demonstrated using the RMS Reports Delete command, related to the logging of messages to GSST.LOG.
