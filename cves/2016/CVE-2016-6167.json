The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":4.4,"cvss-time":"2022-05-01T01:50:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2016-6167","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-05-01T01:50:00","references":["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/137742/Putty-Beta-0.67-DLL-Hijacking.html","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1036236","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/538848/100/0/threaded"],"refmap":{"bugtraq":["20160706 Re: Putty (beta 0.67) DLL Hijacking Vulnerability"],"misc":["https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/137742/Putty-Beta-0.67-DLL-Hijacking.html"],"sectrack":["1036236"]},"summary":"Multiple untrusted search path vulnerabilities in Putty beta 0.67 allow local users to execute arbitrary code and conduct DLL hijacking attacks via a Trojan horse (1) UxTheme.dll or (2) ntmarta.dll file in the current working directory.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:putty:putty:0.67:beta:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:putty:putty:0.67:beta:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:putty:putty:0.67:beta:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
