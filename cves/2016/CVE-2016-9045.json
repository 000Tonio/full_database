Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2022-12-14T14:40:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2016-9045","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-12-14T14:40:00","references":["https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2017-0314"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2017-0314"]},"summary":"A code execution vulnerability exists in ProcessMaker Enterprise Core 3.0.1.7-community.
