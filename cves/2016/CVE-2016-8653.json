Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2023-02-12T23:26:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2016-8653","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2023-02-12T23:26:00","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2016-8653","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/94544"],"refmap":{"bid":["94544"],"confirm":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2016-8653"]},"summary":"It was found that the JMX endpoint of Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6, and Red Hat A-MQ 6 deserializes the credentials passed to it.
