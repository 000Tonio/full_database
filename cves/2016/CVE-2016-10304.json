Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2021-04-20T19:10:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2016-10304","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-04-20T19:10:00","references":["https://erpscan.io/advisories/erpscan-16-029-sap-netweaver-java-7-5-deserialization-untrusted-user-value-trustmanagementservlet/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://erpscan.io/advisories/erpscan-16-029-sap-netweaver-java-7-5-deserialization-untrusted-user-value-trustmanagementservlet/"]},"summary":"The SAP EP-RUNTIME component in SAP NetWeaver AS JAVA 7.5 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (out-of-memory error and service instability) via a crafted serialized Java object, as demonstrated by serial.cc3, aka SAP Security Note 2315788.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver_application_server_java:7.50:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver_application_server_java:7.50:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver_application_server_java:7.50:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
