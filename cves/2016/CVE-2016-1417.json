The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2018-10-09T19:59:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2016-1417","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-10-09T19:59:00","references":["http://hyp3rlinx.altervista.org/advisories/SNORT-DLL-HIJACK.txt","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/138915/Snort-2.9.7.0-WIN32-DLL-Hijacking.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/539579/100/0/threaded","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/93269","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1036936"],"refmap":{"bid":["93269"],"bugtraq":["20161012 Snort v2.9.7.0-WIN32 DLL Hijack"],"misc":["http://hyp3rlinx.altervista.org/advisories/SNORT-DLL-HIJACK.txt","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/138915/Snort-2.9.7.0-WIN32-DLL-Hijacking.html"],"sectrack":["1036936"]},"summary":"Untrusted search path vulnerability in Snort 2.9.7.0-WIN32 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code and conduct DLL hijacking attacks via a Trojan horse tcapi.dll that is located in the same folder on a remote file share as a pcap file that is being processed.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:snort:snort:2.9.7.0:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:snort:snort:2.9.7.0:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:snort:snort:2.9.7.0:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*"]}
