If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2017-03-22T19:46:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2016-4931","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2017-03-22T19:46:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/93540","https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=JSA10760"],"refmap":{"bid":["93540"],"confirm":["https://kb.juniper.net/InfoCenter/index?page=content&id=JSA10760"]},"summary":"XML entity injection in Junos Space before 15.2R2 allows attackers to cause a denial of service.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos_space:15.1:r1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos_space:15.1:r1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos_space:15.2:r1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos_space:15.2:r1:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos_space:15.1:r1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos_space:15.2:r1:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
