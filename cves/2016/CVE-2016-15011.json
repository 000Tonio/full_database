If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2016-15011","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-01-12T16:11:00","references":["https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.217549","https://github.com/e-Contract/dssp/releases/tag/dssp-1.3.2","https://vuldb.com/?id.217549","https://github.com/e-Contract/dssp/commit/ec4238349691ec66dd30b416ec6eaab02d722302"],"summary":"A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in e-Contract dssp up to 1.3.1.
