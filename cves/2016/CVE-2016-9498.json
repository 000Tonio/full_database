Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":10,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:20:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2016-9498","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:20:00","references":["http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Apr/9","https://www.manageengine.com/products/applications_manager/security-updates/security-updates-cve-2016-9498.html","https://www.securityfocus.com/bid/97394/"],"refmap":{"bid":["97394"],"confirm":["https://www.manageengine.com/products/applications_manager/security-updates/security-updates-cve-2016-9498.html"],"fulldisc":["20170404 ManageEngine Applications Manager Multiple Vulnerabilities"]},"summary":"ManageEngine Applications Manager 12 and 13 before build 13200, allows unserialization of unsafe Java objects.
