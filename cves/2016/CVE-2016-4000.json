Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2020-07-15T03:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2016-4000","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-07-15T03:15:00","references":["http://bugs.jython.org/issue2454","http://www.debian.org/security/2017/dsa-3893","http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2018-4428296.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/105647","https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=864859","https://hg.python.org/jython/file/v2.7.1rc1/NEWS","https://hg.python.org/jython/rev/d06e29d100c0","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/0919ec1db20b1022f22b8e78f355667df74d6142b463ff17d03ad533@%3Cdevnull.infra.apache.org%3E","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201710-28","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4000","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGPYTHON-31451","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html","https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuapr2019-5072813.html","https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujan2019-5072801.html","https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2019-5072832.html"],"refmap":{"bid":["105647"],"confirm":["http://bugs.jython.org/issue2454","http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2018-4428296.html","https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=864859","https://hg.python.org/jython/file/v2.7.1rc1/NEWS","https://hg.python.org/jython/rev/d06e29d100c0","https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpujan2019-5072801.html"],"debian":["DSA-3893"],"gentoo":["GLSA-201710-28"],"misc":["https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-4000","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGPYTHON-31451","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2020.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html","https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuapr2019-5072813.html","https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/security-advisory/cpuoct2019-5072832.html"],"mlist":["[infra-devnull] 20190402 [GitHub] [flink] aloyszhang opened pull request #8100: [FLINK-12082] Bump up the jython-standalone version"]},"summary":"Jython before 2.7.1rc1 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted serialized PyFunction object.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:jython_project:jython:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:jython_project:jython:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:jython_project:jython:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
