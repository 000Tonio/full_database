If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2017-03-02T15:05:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2016-8348","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2017-03-02T15:05:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/94587","https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-16-334-01"],"refmap":{"bid":["94587"],"misc":["https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-16-334-01"]},"summary":"An XML External Entity (XXE) issue was discovered in Emerson Liebert SiteScan Web Version 6.5, and prior.
