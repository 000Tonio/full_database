Additionally, writing malicious data to log files may target jobs, filters, reports, and other agents that process the logs in an asynchronous attack pattern. This pattern of attack is similar to \"Log Injection-Tampering-Forging\" except that in this case, the attack is targeting the logs of the web server and not the application."},{"id":"15","name":"Command Delimiters","prerequisites":"Software's input validation or filtering must not detect and block presence of additional malicious command.","related_weakness":["138","140","146","154","157","184","185","697","713","77","78","93"],"solutions":"Design: Perform whitelist validation against a positive specification for command length, type, and parameters.

The system that uses a filter or a blacklist input validation, as opposed to whitelist validation is vulnerable to an attacker who predicts delimiters (or combinations of delimiters) not present in the filter or blacklist. As with other injection attacks, the attacker uses the command delimiter payload as an entry point to tunnel through the application and activate additional attacks through SQL queries, shell commands, network scanning, and so on."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2017-01-11T03:00:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N","cwe":"CWE-93","id":"CVE-2016-9964","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2017-01-11T03:00:00","references":["http://www.debian.org/security/2016/dsa-3743","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/94961","https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle/commit/6d7e13da0f998820800ecb3fe9ccee4189aefb54","https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle/issues/913"],"refmap":{"bid":["94961"],"confirm":["https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle/commit/6d7e13da0f998820800ecb3fe9ccee4189aefb54","https://github.com/bottlepy/bottle/issues/913"],"debian":["DSA-3743"]},"summary":"redirect() in bottle.py in bottle 0.12.10 doesn't filter a \"\\r\\n\" sequence, which leads to a CRLF attack, as demonstrated by a redirect(\"233\\r\\nSet-Cookie: name=salt\") call.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:bottlepy:bottle:0.12.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:bottlepy:bottle:0.12.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:bottlepy:bottle:0.12.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
