If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6,"cvss-time":"2018-10-09T20:00:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2016-4312","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-10-09T20:00:00","references":["http://hyp3rlinx.altervista.org/advisories/WSO2-IDENTITY-SERVER-v5.1.0-XML-External-Entity.txt","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/138329/WSO2-Identity-Server-5.1.0-XML-Injection.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/539199/100/0/threaded","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/92485","https://docs.wso2.com/display/Security/Security+Advisory+WSO2-2016-0096","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40239/"],"refmap":{"bid":["92485"],"bugtraq":["20160813 WSO2 IDENTITY-SERVER v5.1.0 XML External-Entity"],"confirm":["https://docs.wso2.com/display/Security/Security+Advisory+WSO2-2016-0096"],"exploit-db":["40239"],"misc":["http://hyp3rlinx.altervista.org/advisories/WSO2-IDENTITY-SERVER-v5.1.0-XML-External-Entity.txt","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/138329/WSO2-Identity-Server-5.1.0-XML-Injection.html"]},"summary":"XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in the XACML flow feature in WSO2 Identity Server 5.1.0 before WSO2-CARBON-PATCH-4.4.0-0231 allows remote authenticated users with access to XACML features to read arbitrary files, cause a denial of service, conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks, or have unspecified other impact via a crafted XACML request to entitlement/eval-policy-submit.jsp.
