Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2016-12-23T02:59:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2016-7065","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2016-12-23T02:59:00","references":["http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/Nov/143","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/93462","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1382534","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40842/"],"refmap":{"bid":["93462"],"confirm":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1382534"],"exploit-db":["40842"],"fulldisc":["20161125 Red Hat JBoss EAP deserialization of untrusted data"]},"summary":"The JMX servlet in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) 4 and 5 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted serialized Java object.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:redhat:jboss_enterprise_application_platform:4.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:redhat:jboss_enterprise_application_platform:4.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:redhat:jboss_enterprise_application_platform:5.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:redhat:jboss_enterprise_application_platform:5.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:redhat:jboss_enterprise_application_platform:4.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:jboss_enterprise_application_platform:5.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
