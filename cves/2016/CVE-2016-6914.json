Additionally, writing malicious data to log files may target jobs, filters, reports, and other agents that process the logs in an asynchronous attack pattern. This pattern of attack is similar to \"Log Injection-Tampering-Forging\" except that in this case, the attack is targeting the logs of the web server and not the application."},{"id":"1","name":"Accessing Functionality Not Properly Constrained by ACLs","prerequisites":"The application must be navigable in a manner that associates elements (subsections) of the application with ACLs. The various resources, or individual URLs, must be somehow discoverable by the attacker The administrator must have forgotten to associate an ACL or has associated an inappropriately permissive ACL with a particular navigable resource.","related_weakness":["276","285","434","693","721","732"],"solutions":"In a more general setting, the administrator must mark every resource besides the ones supposed to be exposed to the user as accessible by a role impossible for the user to assume. The default security setting must be to deny access and then grant access only to those resources intended by business logic.","summary":"In applications, particularly web applications, access to functionality is mitigated by an authorization framework. This framework maps Access Control Lists (ACLs) to elements of the application's functionality; particularly URL's for web apps. In the case that the administrator failed to specify an ACL for a particular element, an attacker may be able to access it with impunity. An attacker with the ability to access functionality not properly constrained by ACLs can obtain sensitive information and possibly compromise the entire application. Such an attacker can access resources that must be available only to users at a higher privilege level, can access management sections of the application, or can run queries for data that they otherwise not supposed to."},{"id":"127","name":"Directory Indexing","prerequisites":"The target must be misconfigured to return a list of a directory's content when it receives a request that ends in a directory name rather than a file name. The adversary must be able to control the path that is requested of the target. The administrator must have failed to properly configure an ACL or has associated an overly permissive ACL with a particular directory. The server version or patch level must not inherently prevent known directory listing attacks from working.","related_weakness":["276","285","288","424","425","693","721","732"],"solutions":"1. Using blank index.html: putting blank index.html simply prevent directory listings from displaying to site visitors. 2. Preventing with .htaccess in Apache web server: In .htaccess, write \"Options-indexes\". 3. Suppressing error messages: using error 403 \"Forbidden\" message exactly like error 404 \"Not Found\" message.","summary":"An adversary crafts a request to a target that results in the target listing/indexing the content of a directory as output. One common method of triggering directory contents as output is to construct a request containing a path that terminates in a directory name rather than a file name since many applications are configured to provide a list of the directory's contents when such a request is received. An adversary can use this to explore the directory tree on a target as well as learn the names of files. This can often end up revealing test files, backup files, temporary files, hidden files, configuration files, user accounts, script contents, as well as naming conventions, all of which can be used by an attacker to mount additional attacks."}],"cvss":7.2,"cvss-time":"2021-09-13T12:09:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-276","id":"CVE-2016-6914","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2021-09-13T12:09:00","references":["https://hackerone.com/reports/140793","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2017/Dec/83","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/145533/Ubiquiti-UniFi-Video-3.7.3-Windows-Local-Privilege-Escalation.html","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43390/","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/102278"],"refmap":{"bid":["102278"],"exploit-db":["43390"],"fulldisc":["20171223 [CVE-2016-6914] Ubiquiti UniFi Video v3.7.3 (Windows) Local Privileges Escalation via Insecure Directory Permissions"],"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/145533/Ubiquiti-UniFi-Video-3.7.3-Windows-Local-Privilege-Escalation.html","https://hackerone.com/reports/140793"]},"summary":"Ubiquiti UniFi Video before 3.8.0 for Windows uses weak permissions for the installation directory, which allows local users to gain SYSTEM privileges via a Trojan horse taskkill.exe file.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ui:unifi_video:2.1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ui:unifi_video:2.1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ui:unifi_video:3.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ui:unifi_video:3.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ui:unifi_video:3.1.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ui:unifi_video:3.1.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ui:unifi_video:3.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ui:unifi_video:3.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ui:unifi_video:3.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ui:unifi_video:3.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ui:unifi_video:3.7.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ui:unifi_video:3.7.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ui:unifi_video:3.7.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ui:unifi_video:3.7.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:ui:unifi_video:2.1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ui:unifi_video:3.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ui:unifi_video:3.1.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ui:unifi_video:3.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ui:unifi_video:3.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ui:unifi_video:3.7.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ui:unifi_video:3.7.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
