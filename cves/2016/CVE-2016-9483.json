Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:20:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2016-9483","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:20:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/94778","https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/494015"],"refmap":{"bid":["94778"],"cert-vn":["VU#494015"]},"summary":"The PHP form code generated by PHP FormMail Generator deserializes untrusted input as part of the phpfmg_filman_download() function.
