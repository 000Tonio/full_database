Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":2.6,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:20:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2016-9585","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:20:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/94932","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1404528"],"refmap":{"bid":["94932"],"confirm":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1404528"]},"summary":"Red Hat JBoss EAP version 5 is vulnerable to a deserialization of untrusted data in the JMX endpoint when deserializes the credentials passed to it.
