If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2019-10-09T23:20:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2016-9487","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-10-09T23:20:00","references":["https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/779243","https://www.securityfocus.com/bid/94864/"],"refmap":{"bid":["94864"],"cert-vn":["VU#779243"]},"summary":"EpubCheck 4.0.1 does not properly restrict resolving external entities when parsing XML in EPUB files during validation.
