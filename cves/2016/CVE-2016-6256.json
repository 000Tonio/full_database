If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2019-07-08T20:00:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2016-6256","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-07-08T20:00:00","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/142597/SAP-Business-One-For-Android-1.2.3-XML-Injection.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/98590","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/42036/"],"refmap":{"bid":["98590"],"exploit-db":["42036"],"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/142597/SAP-Business-One-For-Android-1.2.3-XML-Injection.html"]},"summary":"SAP Business One for Android 1.2.3 allows remote attackers to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks via crafted XML data in a request to B1iXcellerator/exec/soap/vP.001sap0003.in_WCSX/com.sap.b1i.vplatform.runtime/INB_WS_CALL_SYNC_XPT/INB_WS_CALL_SYNC_XPT.ipo/proc, aka SAP Security Note 2378065.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:business_one:1.2.3:*:*:*:*:android:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:business_one:1.2.3:*:*:*:*:android:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sap:business_one:1.2.3:*:*:*:*:android:*:*"]}
