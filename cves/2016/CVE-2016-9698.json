If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2017-06-14T14:05:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:C","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2016-9698","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2017-06-14T14:05:00","references":["http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21999960","http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22002258","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/96829","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119522"],"refmap":{"bid":["96829"],"confirm":["http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21999960","http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg22002258"],"misc":["https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/119522"]},"summary":"IBM Rhapsody DM 4.0, 5.0, and 6.0 is vulnerable to a denial of service, caused by an XML External Entity Injection (XXE) error when processing XML data.
