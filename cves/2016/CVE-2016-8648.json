Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2023-02-12T23:26:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2016-8648","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2023-02-12T23:26:00","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2016-8648","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/94513"],"refmap":{"bid":["94513"],"confirm":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2016-8648"]},"summary":"It was found that the Karaf container used by Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.x, and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.x, deserializes objects passed to MBeans via JMX operations.
