If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2017-03-08T01:07:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2016-10127","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2017-03-08T01:07:00","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2017/01/19/5","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95376","https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=850716","https://github.com/rohe/pysaml2/commit/6e09a25d9b4b7aa7a506853210a9a14100b8bc9b","https://github.com/rohe/pysaml2/issues/366","https://github.com/rohe/pysaml2/pull/379"],"refmap":{"bid":["95376"],"misc":["https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=850716","https://github.com/rohe/pysaml2/commit/6e09a25d9b4b7aa7a506853210a9a14100b8bc9b","https://github.com/rohe/pysaml2/issues/366","https://github.com/rohe/pysaml2/pull/379"],"mlist":["[oss-security] 20170119 Re: CVE request: python-pysaml2 XML external entity attack"]},"summary":"PySAML2 allows remote attackers to conduct XML external entity (XXE) attacks via a crafted SAML XML request or response.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:pysaml2_project:pysaml2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:pysaml2_project:pysaml2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:pysaml2_project:pysaml2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
