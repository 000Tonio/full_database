When it attempts to convert a malformed PDF to XML a stack variable will be left uninitialized which will later be used to fetch a length that is used in a copy operation. In most cases this will allow an aggressor to write outside the bounds of a stack buffer which is used to contain colors. This can lead to code execution under the context of the account running the tool.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:iceni:argus:6.6.04:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:iceni:argus:6.6.04:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:iceni:argus:6.6.04:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
