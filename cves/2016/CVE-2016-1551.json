Because reference clocks are treated like other peers and stored in the same structure, any packet with a source ip address of a reference clock (127.127.1.1 for example) that reaches the receive() function will match that reference clock's peer record and will be treated as a trusted peer. Any system that lacks the typical martian packet filtering which would block these packets is in danger of having its time controlled by an attacker.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ntp:ntp:4.2.8:p3:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ntp:ntp:4.2.8:p3:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ntpsec:ntpsec:a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ntpsec:ntpsec:a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:ntp:ntp:4.2.8:p3:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ntpsec:ntpsec:a5fb34b9cc89b92a8fef2f459004865c93bb7f92:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
