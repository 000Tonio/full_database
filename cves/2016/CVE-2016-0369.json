If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2018-03-17T10:29:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2016-0369","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2018-03-17T10:29:00","references":["http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21988727","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/112088"],"refmap":{"confirm":["http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21988727"],"xf":["ibm-forms-cve20160369-info-disc(112088)"]},"summary":"XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in IBM Forms Experience Builder 8.5, 8.5.1, and 8.6 allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information via crafted XML data.
