Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":10,"cvss-time":"2018-03-05T17:19:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2016-8519","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2018-03-05T17:19:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95225","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1037552","https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-c05361944","https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2017-05"],"refmap":{"bid":["95225"],"confirm":["https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docId=emr_na-c05361944"],"misc":["https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2017-05"],"sectrack":["1037552"]},"summary":"A remote code execution vulnerability in HPE Operations Orchestration Community edition and Enterprise edition prior to v10.70 was found.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:hp:operations_orchestration:*:*:*:*:community:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:hp:operations_orchestration:*:*:*:*:community:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:hp:operations_orchestration:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:hp:operations_orchestration:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:hp:operations_orchestration:*:*:*:*:community:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:hp:operations_orchestration:*:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*"]}
