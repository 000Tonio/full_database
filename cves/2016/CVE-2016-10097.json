If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2017-01-11T02:59:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2016-10097","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2017-01-11T02:59:00","references":["http://www.cloudscan.me/2016/03/xxe-dork-open-am-1010-xml-injection.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/95174","https://twitter.com/h02332/status/816252923688665088"],"refmap":{"bid":["95174"],"misc":["http://www.cloudscan.me/2016/03/xxe-dork-open-am-1010-xml-injection.html","https://twitter.com/h02332/status/816252923688665088"]},"summary":"XML External Entity (XXE) Vulnerability in /SSOPOST/metaAlias/%realm%/idpv2 in OpenAM - Access Management 10.1.0 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via the SAMLRequest parameter.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:forgerock:openam:10.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:forgerock:openam:10.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:forgerock:openam:10.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
