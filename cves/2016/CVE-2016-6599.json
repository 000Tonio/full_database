This service contains a method that can be used to retrieve a configuration file that contains the application database name, username and password as well as the domain administrator username and password. These are encrypted with a fixed key and IV (\"NumaraIT\") using the DES algorithm. The domain administrator username and password can only be obtained if the Self-Service component is enabled, which is the most common scenario in enterprise deployments.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:bmc:track-it\\!:11.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:bmc:track-it\\!:11.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:bmc:track-it\\!:11.4:hf1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:bmc:track-it\\!:11.4:hf1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:bmc:track-it\\!:11.4:hf2:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:bmc:track-it\\!:11.4:hf2:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:bmc:track-it\\!:11.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:bmc:track-it\\!:11.4:hf1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:bmc:track-it\\!:11.4:hf2:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
