If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":9.3,"cvss-time":"2018-12-05T11:29:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2016-5002","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2018-12-05T11:29:00","redhat":{"advisories":[{"rhsa":{"id":"RHSA-2018:3768"}}]},"references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/07/12/5","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/91736","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1036294","https://0ang3el.blogspot.in/2016/07/beware-of-ws-xmlrpc-library-in-your.html","https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2018:3768","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/115042"],"refmap":{"bid":["91736"],"misc":["https://0ang3el.blogspot.in/2016/07/beware-of-ws-xmlrpc-library-in-your.html"],"mlist":["[oss-security] 20160712 Vulnerabilities in Apache Archiva"],"sectrack":["1036294"],"xf":["apache-archiva-cve20165002-ssrf(115042)"]},"summary":"XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in the Apache XML-RPC (aka ws-xmlrpc) library 3.1.3, as used in Apache Archiva, allows remote attackers to conduct server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks via a crafted DTD.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:xml-rpc:3.1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:xml-rpc:3.1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:apache:xml-rpc:3.1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
