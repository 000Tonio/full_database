When using a code book, application error messages aren't generated in string or stack trace form, but are catalogued and replaced with a unique (often integer-based) value 'coding' for the error. Such a technique will require helpdesk and hosting personnel to use a 'code book' or similar mapping to decode application errors/logs in order to respond to them normally. Design: wrap application functionality (preferably through the underlying framework) in an output encoding scheme that obscures or cleanses error messages to prevent such attacks. Such a technique is often used in conjunction with the above 'code book' suggestion. Implementation: Obfuscate server fields of HTTP response. Implementation: Hide inner ordering of HTTP response header. Implementation: Customizing HTTP error codes such as 404 or 500. Implementation: Hide HTTP response header software information filed. Implementation: Hide cookie's software information filed. Implementation: Obfuscate database type in Database API's error message.","summary":"An attacker sends random, malformed, or otherwise unexpected messages to a target application and observes the application's log or error messages returned. Fuzzing techniques involve sending random or malformed messages to a target and monitoring the target's response. The attacker does not initially know how a target will respond to individual messages but by attempting a large number of message variants they may find a variant that trigger's desired behavior. In this attack, the purpose of the fuzzing is to observe the application's log and error messages, although fuzzing a target can also sometimes cause the target to enter an unstable state, causing a crash. By observing logs and error messages, the attacker can learn details about the configuration of the target application and might be able to cause the target to disclose sensitive information."}],"cvss":2.1,"cvss-time":"2023-02-12T23:20:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-532","id":"CVE-2016-4443","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2023-02-12T23:20:00","redhat":{"advisories":[{"rhsa":{"id":"RHSA-2016:1929"}}],"rpms":["rhevm-0:3.6.9.2-0.1.el6","rhevm-backend-0:3.6.9.2-0.1.el6","rhevm-dbscripts-0:3.6.9.2-0.1.el6","rhevm-extensions-api-impl-0:3.6.9.2-0.1.el6","rhevm-extensions-api-impl-javadoc-0:3.6.9.2-0.1.el6","rhevm-lib-0:3.6.9.2-0.1.el6","rhevm-restapi-0:3.6.9.2-0.1.el6","rhevm-setup-0:3.6.9.2-0.1.el6","rhevm-setup-base-0:3.6.9.2-0.1.el6","rhevm-setup-plugin-ovirt-engine-0:3.6.9.2-0.1.el6","rhevm-setup-plugin-ovirt-engine-common-0:3.6.9.2-0.1.el6","rhevm-setup-plugin-vmconsole-proxy-helper-0:3.6.9.2-0.1.el6","rhevm-setup-plugin-websocket-proxy-0:3.6.9.2-0.1.el6","rhevm-tools-0:3.6.9.2-0.1.el6","rhevm-tools-backup-0:3.6.9.2-0.1.el6","rhevm-userportal-0:3.6.9.2-0.1.el6","rhevm-userportal-debuginfo-0:3.6.9.2-0.1.el6","rhevm-vmconsole-proxy-helper-0:3.6.9.2-0.1.el6","rhevm-webadmin-portal-0:3.6.9.2-0.1.el6","rhevm-webadmin-portal-debuginfo-0:3.6.9.2-0.1.el6","rhevm-websocket-proxy-0:3.6.9.2-0.1.el6"]},"references":["http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1036863","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1335106","http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2016-1929.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/92751"],"refmap":{"bid":["92751"],"confirm":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1335106"],"sectrack":["1036863"]},"summary":"Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV) Manager 3.6 allows local users to obtain encryption keys, certificates, and other sensitive information by reading the engine-setup log file.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:redhat:enterprise_virtualization:3.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:redhat:enterprise_virtualization:3.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:redhat:enterprise_virtualization:3.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
