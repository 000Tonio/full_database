If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2016-11-28T20:32:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2016-6408","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2016-11-28T20:32:00","references":["http://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20160921-cph","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/93092"],"refmap":{"bid":["93092"],"cisco":["20160921 Cisco Prime Home Web-Based User Interface XML External Entity Vulnerability"]},"summary":"Cisco Prime Home 5.2.0 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via an XML document containing an external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference, related to an XML External Entity (XXE) issue, aka Bug ID CSCvb17814.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:prime_home:5.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:prime_home:5.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:cisco:prime_home:5.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
