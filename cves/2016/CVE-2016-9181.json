If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5.8,"cvss-time":"2016-12-23T20:44:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2016-9181","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2016-12-23T20:44:00","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/11/04/2","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/94220","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1379556"],"refmap":{"bid":["94220"],"mlist":["[oss-security] 20161104 Re: CVE request: XXE in perl Image:nfo and XML:wig"]},"summary":"perl-Image-Info: When parsing an SVG file, external entity expansion (XXE) was not disabled.
