If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.4,"cvss-time":"2020-08-14T21:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2016-9180","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-08-14T21:15:00","references":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-08/msg00020.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-08/msg00033.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/11/04/2","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/94219"],"refmap":{"bid":["94219"],"mlist":["[oss-security] 20161104 Re: CVE request: XXE in perl Image:nfo and XML:wig"],"suse":["openSUSE-SU-2020:1177","openSUSE-SU-2020:1204"]},"summary":"perl-XML-Twig: The option to `expand_external_ents`, documented as controlling external entity expansion in XML::Twig does not work.
