Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2020-03-10T20:02:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2016-1487","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-03-10T20:02:00","references":["http://support.lexmark.com/index?page=content&id=TE747&locale=EN&userlocale=EN_US"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://support.lexmark.com/index?page=content&id=TE747&locale=EN&userlocale=EN_US"]},"summary":"Lexmark Markvision Enterprise before 2.3.0 misuses the Apache Commons Collections Library, leading to remote code execution because of Java deserialization.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:lexmark:markvision_enterprise:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:lexmark:markvision_enterprise:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:lexmark:markvision_enterprise:2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:lexmark:markvision_enterprise:2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:lexmark:markvision_enterprise:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:lexmark:markvision_enterprise:2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
