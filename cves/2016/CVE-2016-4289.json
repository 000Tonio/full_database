A specially created long path can lead to a buffer overflow on the stack resulting in code execution. An attacker needs to create path longer than 99 characters to trigger this vulnerability.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:gmer:gmer:2.1.19357:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:gmer:gmer:2.1.19357:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:gmer:gmer:2.1.19357:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
