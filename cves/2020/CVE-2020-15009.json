The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":4.4,"cvss-time":"2020-07-29T16:03:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2020-15009","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-07-29T16:03:00","references":["https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ClzHH5Jw3PgZw74RvKrEP8xU0TUc5Ta0/view?usp=sharing","https://www.asus.com/Static_WebPage/ASUS-Product-Security-Advisory/","https://www.asus.com/support/FAQ/1043674"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://www.asus.com/Static_WebPage/ASUS-Product-Security-Advisory/","https://www.asus.com/support/FAQ/1043674"],"misc":["https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ClzHH5Jw3PgZw74RvKrEP8xU0TUc5Ta0/view?usp=sharing"]},"summary":"AsusScreenXpertServicec.exe and ScreenXpertUpgradeServiceManager.exe in ScreenPad2_Upgrade_Tool.msi V1.0.3 for ASUS PCs with ScreenPad 1.0 (UX450FDX, UX550GDX and UX550GEX) could lead to unsigned code execution with no additional restrictions when a user puts an application at a particular path with a particular file name.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:asus:screenpad2_upgrade_tool:1.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:asus:screenpad2_upgrade_tool:1.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:asus:screenpad2_upgrade_tool:1.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
