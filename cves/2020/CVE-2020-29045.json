Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2021-03-17T14:53:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-29045","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-03-17T14:53:00","references":["https://appcheck-ng.com/cve-2020-29045/","https://wordpress.org/plugins/food-and-drink-menu/#developers"],"summary":"The food-and-drink-menu plugin through 2.2.0 for WordPress allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because of an unserialize operation on the fdm_cart cookie in load_cart_from_cookie in includes/class-cart-manager.php.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:fivestarplugins:five_star_restaurant_menu:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:fivestarplugins:five_star_restaurant_menu:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:fivestarplugins:five_star_restaurant_menu:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"]}
