If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2020-05-12T18:51:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-3256","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-05-12T18:51:00","references":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-hcmf-xxe-qqCMAUJ2"],"refmap":{"cisco":["20200506 Cisco Hosted Collaboration Mediation Fulfillment XML External Expansion Vulnerability"]},"summary":"A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Hosted Collaboration Mediation Fulfillment (HCM-F) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain read access to information that is stored on an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need administrative privileges on the Cisco HCM-F Software. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests that contain references in XML entities to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:hosted_collaboration_mediation_fulfillment:11.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:hosted_collaboration_mediation_fulfillment:11.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:hosted_collaboration_mediation_fulfillment:11.5\\(3\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:hosted_collaboration_mediation_fulfillment:11.5\\(3\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:cisco:hosted_collaboration_mediation_fulfillment:11.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cisco:hosted_collaboration_mediation_fulfillment:11.5\\(3\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
