The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization of the System Operator role capabilities. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in with the System Operator role, performing a series of actions, and then assuming a new higher privileged role. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform all actions associated with the privilege of the assumed role. If that role is an administrative role, the attacker would gain full access to the device.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:smart_software_manager_on-prem:8-202004:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:smart_software_manager_on-prem:8-202004:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:cisco:smart_software_manager_on-prem:8-202004:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
