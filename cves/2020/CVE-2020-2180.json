Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2020-04-28T15:58:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-2180","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-04-28T15:58:00","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/04/16/4","https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2020-04-16/#SECURITY-1736"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://jenkins.io/security/advisory/2020-04-16/#SECURITY-1736"],"mlist":["[oss-security] 20200416 Multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins plugins"]},"summary":"Jenkins AWS SAM Plugin 1.2.2 and earlier does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types, resulting in a remote code execution vulnerability.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:amazon_web_services_serverless_application_model:1.2.2:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:amazon_web_services_serverless_application_model:1.2.2:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:amazon_web_services_serverless_application_model:1.2.2:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*"]}
