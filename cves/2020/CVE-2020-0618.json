Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2022-01-01T19:59:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-0618","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-01-01T19:59:00","references":["https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0618","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/156707/SQL-Server-Reporting-Services-SSRS-ViewState-Deserialization.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/159216/Microsoft-SQL-Server-Reporting-Services-2016-Remote-Code-Execution.html"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/156707/SQL-Server-Reporting-Services-SSRS-ViewState-Deserialization.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/159216/Microsoft-SQL-Server-Reporting-Services-2016-Remote-Code-Execution.html","https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-0618"]},"saint":[{"description":"Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services 2016 ViewState deserialization vulnerability","id":"database_mssql_mssql","title":"ms_ssrs_viewstate_deserialization","type":"remote"}],"summary":"A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services when it incorrectly handles page requests, aka 'Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services Remote Code Execution Vulnerability'.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:sql_server:2012:sp4:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:sql_server:2012:sp4:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:sql_server:2014:sp3:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:sql_server:2014:sp3:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:sql_server:2016:sp2:*:*:*:*:x64:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:sql_server:2016:sp2:*:*:*:*:x64:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:sql_server:2012:sp4:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:sql_server:2014:sp3:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:sql_server:2016:sp2:*:*:*:*:x64:*"]}
