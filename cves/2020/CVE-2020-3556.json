The vulnerability is due to a lack of authentication to the IPC listener. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPC messages to the AnyConnect client IPC listener. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause the targeted AnyConnect user to execute a script. This script would execute with the privileges of the targeted AnyConnect user. In order to successfully exploit this vulnerability, there must be an ongoing AnyConnect session by the targeted user at the time of the attack. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would also need valid user credentials on the system upon which the AnyConnect client is being run. Cisco has not released software updates that address this vulnerability.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:anyconnect_secure_mobility_client:4.9\\(3052\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:anyconnect_secure_mobility_client:4.9\\(3052\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:anyconnect_secure_mobility_client:98.145\\(86\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:anyconnect_secure_mobility_client:98.145\\(86\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:cisco:anyconnect_secure_mobility_client:4.9\\(3052\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cisco:anyconnect_secure_mobility_client:98.145\\(86\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
