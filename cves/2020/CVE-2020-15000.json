OpenPGP has three passwords: Admin PIN, Reset Code, and User PIN. The Reset Code is used to reset the User PIN, but it is disabled by default. A flaw in the implementation of OpenPGP sets the Reset Code to a known value upon initialization. If the retry counter for the Reset Code is set to non-zero without changing the Reset Code, this known value can be used to reset the User PIN. To set the retry counters, the Admin PIN is required.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:yubico:yubikey_5_nfc_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:yubico:yubikey_5_nfc_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:yubico:yubikey_5_nfc:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:yubico:yubikey_5_nfc:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:yubico:yubikey_5_nfc_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
