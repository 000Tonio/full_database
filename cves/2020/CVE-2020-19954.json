If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2021-10-20T14:14:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-19954","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-10-20T14:14:00","references":["https://github.com/zhuxianjin/vuln_repo/blob/master/S-CMS%20v3.0%20XXE%20Arbitrary%20File%20Read%20Vulnerability.md"],"summary":"An XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability was discovered in /api/notify.php in S-CMS 3.0 which allows attackers to read arbitrary files.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:s-cms:s-cms:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:s-cms:s-cms:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:s-cms:s-cms:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
