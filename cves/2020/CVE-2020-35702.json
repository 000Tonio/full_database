NOTE: later reports indicate that this only affects builds from Poppler git clones in late December 2020, not the 20.12.1 release. In this situation, it should NOT be considered a Poppler vulnerability. However, several third-party Open Source projects directly rely on Poppler git clones made at arbitrary times, and therefore the CVE remains useful to users of those projects.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:freedesktop:poppler:20.12.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:freedesktop:poppler:20.12.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:freedesktop:poppler:20.12.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
