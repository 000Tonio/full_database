If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-36640","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-01-11T18:34:00","references":["https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-connector-webservice/pull/17","https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-connector-webservice/releases/tag/1.3.1","https://github.com/bonitasoft/bonita-connector-webservice/commit/a12ad691c05af19e9061d7949b6b828ce48815d5","https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.217443","https://vuldb.com/?id.217443"],"summary":"A vulnerability, which was classified as problematic, was found in bonitasoft bonita-connector-webservice up to 1.3.0.
