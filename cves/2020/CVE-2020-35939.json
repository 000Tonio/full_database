Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6,"cvss-time":"2021-01-11T21:36:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-35939","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-01-11T21:36:00","references":["https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2020/10/high-severity-vulnerabilities-in-post-grid-and-team-showcase-plugins/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2020/10/high-severity-vulnerabilities-in-post-grid-and-team-showcase-plugins/"]},"summary":"PHP Object injection vulnerabilities in the Team Showcase plugin before 1.22.16 for WordPress allow remote authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary PHP objects due to insecure unserialization of data supplied in a remotely hosted crafted payload in the source parameter via AJAX.
