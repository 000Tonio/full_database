An attacker can provide a specially crafted shader file to trigger this vulnerability, resulting in code execution. This vulnerability can be triggered from a HYPER-V guest using the RemoteFX feature, leading to executing the vulnerable code on the HYPER-V host (inside of the rdvgm.exe process). Theoretically this vulnerability could be also triggered from web browser (using webGL and webassembly).","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:amd:radeon_directx_11_driver_atidxx64.dll:26.20.15019.19000:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:amd:radeon_directx_11_driver_atidxx64.dll:26.20.15019.19000:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:amd:radeon_directx_11_driver_atidxx64.dll:26.20.15019.19000:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
