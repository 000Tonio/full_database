When using a code book, application error messages aren't generated in string or stack trace form, but are catalogued and replaced with a unique (often integer-based) value 'coding' for the error. Such a technique will require helpdesk and hosting personnel to use a 'code book' or similar mapping to decode application errors/logs in order to respond to them normally. Design: wrap application functionality (preferably through the underlying framework) in an output encoding scheme that obscures or cleanses error messages to prevent such attacks. Such a technique is often used in conjunction with the above 'code book' suggestion. Implementation: Obfuscate server fields of HTTP response. Implementation: Hide inner ordering of HTTP response header. Implementation: Customizing HTTP error codes such as 404 or 500. Implementation: Hide HTTP response header software information filed. Implementation: Hide cookie's software information filed. Implementation: Obfuscate database type in Database API's error message.","summary":"An attacker sends random, malformed, or otherwise unexpected messages to a target application and observes the application's log or error messages returned. Fuzzing techniques involve sending random or malformed messages to a target and monitoring the target's response. The attacker does not initially know how a target will respond to individual messages but by attempting a large number of message variants they may find a variant that trigger's desired behavior. In this attack, the purpose of the fuzzing is to observe the application's log and error messages, although fuzzing a target can also sometimes cause the target to enter an unstable state, causing a crash. By observing logs and error messages, the attacker can learn details about the configuration of the target application and might be able to cause the target to disclose sensitive information."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2022-01-01T20:03:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-532","id":"CVE-2020-1928","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-01-01T20:03:00","references":["https://nifi.apache.org/security.html#CVE-2020-1928","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rd50baccd1bbb96c2327d5a8caa25a49692b3d68d96915bd1cfbb9f8b@%3Cusers.tomcat.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r38a5b7943b9a62ecb853acc22ef08ff586a7b3c66e08f949f0396ab1@%3Cusers.tomcat.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r17aaa3a05b5b7fe9075613dd0c681efa60a4f8c8fbad152c61371b6e@%3Cusers.tomcat.apache.org%3E"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://nifi.apache.org/security.html#CVE-2020-1928"],"mlist":["[tomcat-users] 20200302 AW: [SECURITY] CVE-2020-1938 AJP Request Injection and potentialRemote Code Execution","[tomcat-users] 20200302 Re: AW: [SECURITY] CVE-2020-1938 AJP Request Injection and potentialRemote Code Execution","[tomcat-users] 20200302 Re: [SECURITY] CVE-2020-1938 AJP Request Injection and potential Remote Code Execution"]},"summary":"An information disclosure vulnerability was found in Apache NiFi 1.10.0.
