Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":9.3,"cvss-time":"2020-07-17T13:18:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-4305","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2020-07-17T13:18:00","references":["https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/176677","https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6244664"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6244664"],"xf":["ibm-infosphere-cve20204305-code-exec (176677)"]},"summary":"IBM InfoSphere Information Server 11.3, 11.5, and 11.7 could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by the deserialization of untrusted data.
