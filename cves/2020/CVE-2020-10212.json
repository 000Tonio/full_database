For example, an SSRF attempt may succeed if a .ico filename is added to the PATH_INFO. Also, an attacker could create a DNS hostname that resolves to the 0.0.0.0 IP address for DNS pinning. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-14728.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:tecrail:responsive_filemanager:9.13.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:tecrail:responsive_filemanager:9.13.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:tecrail:responsive_filemanager:9.14.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:tecrail:responsive_filemanager:9.14.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:tecrail:responsive_filemanager:9.13.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:tecrail:responsive_filemanager:9.14.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
