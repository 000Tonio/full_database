Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2022-10-19T17:26:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-26867","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-10-19T17:26:00","references":["https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-308-03","https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/advisories/klcert-advisories/2020/10/09/klcert-20-015-remote-code-execution-in-arc-informatique-pcvue/","https://www.pcvuesolutions.com/security","https://www.pcvuesolutions.com/support/index.php/en/security-bulletin/1076-security-bulletin-2020-1"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://ics-cert.kaspersky.com/advisories/klcert-advisories/2020/10/09/klcert-20-015-remote-code-execution-in-arc-informatique-pcvue/","https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-308-03","https://www.pcvuesolutions.com/security","https://www.pcvuesolutions.com/support/index.php/en/security-bulletin/1076-security-bulletin-2020-1"],"misc":["https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-308-03"]},"summary":"ARC Informatique PcVue prior to version 12.0.17 is vulnerable due to the deserialization of untrusted data, which may allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the web and mobile back-end server.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:pcvuesolutions:pcvue:8.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:pcvuesolutions:pcvue:8.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:pcvuesolutions:pcvue:12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:pcvuesolutions:pcvue:12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:pcvuesolutions:pcvue:8.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:pcvuesolutions:pcvue:12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
