While being logged in to some target system, the victim visits the attackers' malicious site which displays a UI that the victim wishes to interact with. In reality, the iFrame overlay page has a transparent layer above the visible UI with action controls that the attacker wishes the victim to execute. The victim clicks on buttons or other UI elements they see on the page which actually triggers the action controls in the transparent overlaying layer. Depending on what that action control is, the attacker may have just tricked the victim into executing some potentially privileged (and most undesired) functionality in the target system to which the victim is authenticated. The basic problem here is that there is a dichotomy between what the victim thinks he or she is clicking on versus what he or she is actually clicking on."},{"id":"504","name":"Task Impersonation","prerequisites":"","related_weakness":["1021"],"solutions":"The only known mitigation to this attack is to avoid installing the malicious application on the device. However, the malicious application does need the GET_TASKS permission to be able to query the task list, and being suspicious of applications with that permission can help.","summary":"An adversary, through a previously installed malicious application, monitors the task list maintained by the operating system and waits for a specific legitimate task to become active. Once the task is detected, the malicious application launches a new task in the foreground that mimics the user interface of the legitimate task. At this point, the user thinks that they are interacting with the legitimate task that they started, but instead they are interacting with the malicious application. This type of attack is most often used to obtain sensitive information (e.g., credentials) from the user. Once the adversary's goal is reached, the malicious application can exit, leaving the original trusted application visible and the appearance that nothing out of the ordinary has occurred."},{"id":"181","name":"Flash File Overlay","prerequisites":"The victim must be tricked into navigating to the attackers' decoy site and performing the actions on the decoy page. The victim's browser must support invisible Flash overlays.","related_weakness":["1021"],"solutions":"","summary":"An attacker creates a transparent overlay using flash in order to intercept user actions for the purpose of performing a clickjacking attack. In this technique, the Flash file provides a transparent overlay over HTML content. Because the Flash application is on top of the content, user actions, such as clicks, are caught by the Flash application rather than the underlying HTML. The action is then interpreted by the overlay to perform the actions the attacker wishes."},{"id":"506","name":"Tapjacking","prerequisites":"This pattern of attack requires the ability to execute a malicious application on the user's device.

This is often accomplished by overlaying one screen on top of another while giving the appearance of a single interface. There are two main techniques used to accomplish this. The first is to leverage transparent properties that allow taps on the screen to pass through the visible application to an application running in the background. The second is to strategically place a small object (e.g., a button or text field) on top of the visible screen and make it appear to be a part of the underlying application. In both cases, the user is convinced to tap on the screen but does not realize the application that they are interacting with."},{"id":"103","name":"Clickjacking","prerequisites":"The victim is communicating with the target application via a web based UI and not a thick client The victim's browser security policies allow at least one of the following JavaScript, Flash, iFrames, ActiveX, or CSS.
