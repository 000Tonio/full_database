In particular, there is no validation that the values in the `splits` tensor generate a valid partitioning of the `values` tensor. Hence, the code is prone to heap buffer overflow. If `split_values` does not end with a value at least `num_values` then the `while` loop condition will trigger a read outside of the bounds of `split_values` once `batch_idx` grows too large. The issue is patched in commit 3cbb917b4714766030b28eba9fb41bb97ce9ee02 and is released in TensorFlow version 2.3.1.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.3.0:*:*:*:-:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.3.0:*:*:*:-:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.3.0:*:*:*:-:*:*:*"]}
