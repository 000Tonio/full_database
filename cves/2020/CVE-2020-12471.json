Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2020-05-04T16:37:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-12471","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-05-04T16:37:00","references":["https://github.com/belong2yourself/vulnerabilities/tree/master/MonoX%20CMS/Remote%20Code%20Execution%20via%20Insecure%20Deserialization"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/belong2yourself/vulnerabilities/tree/master/MonoX%20CMS/Remote%20Code%20Execution%20via%20Insecure%20Deserialization"]},"summary":"MonoX through 5.1.40.5152 allows remote code execution via HTML5Upload.ashx or Pages/SocialNetworking/lng/en-US/PhotoGallery.aspx because of deserialization in ModuleGallery.HTML5Upload, ModuleGallery.SilverLightUploadModule, HTML5Upload, and SilverLightUploadHandler.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mono:monox:5.1.40.5152:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mono:monox:5.1.40.5152:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:mono:monox:5.1.40.5152:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
