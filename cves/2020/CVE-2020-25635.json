ADS allows multiple \"files\" to be stored in one directory entry referenced as filename:streamname. One or more alternate data streams may be stored in any file or directory. Normal Microsoft utilities do not show the presence of an ADS stream attached to a file. The additional space for the ADS is not recorded in the displayed file size. The additional space for ADS is accounted for in the used space on the volume. An ADS can be any type of file. ADS are copied by standard Microsoft utilities between NTFS volumes. ADS can be used by an attacker or intruder to hide tools, scripts, and data from detection by normal system utilities. Many anti-virus programs do not check for or scan ADS. Windows Vista does have a switch (-R) on the command line DIR command that will display alternate streams."}],"cvss":2.1,"cvss-time":"2020-10-08T18:40:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-212","id":"CVE-2020-25635","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-10-08T18:40:00","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-25635","https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/issues/222"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-25635"],"misc":["https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.aws/issues/222"]},"summary":"A flaw was found in Ansible Base when using the aws_ssm connection plugin as garbage collector is not happening after playbook run is completed.
