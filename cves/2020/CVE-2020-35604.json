If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":9.3,"cvss-time":"2020-12-22T17:16:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-35604","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2020-12-22T17:16:00","references":["https://www.mindpointgroup.com/blog/webta-xxe-version-5-0-4-vulnerability/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.mindpointgroup.com/blog/webta-xxe-version-5-0-4-vulnerability/"]},"summary":"An XXE attack can occur in Kronos WebTA 5.0.4 when SAML is used.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:kronos:web_time_and_attendance:5.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:kronos:web_time_and_attendance:5.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:kronos:web_time_and_attendance:5.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
