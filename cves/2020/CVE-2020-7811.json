Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":4.6,"cvss-time":"2020-10-19T19:34:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-7811","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-10-19T19:34:00","references":["https://www.boho.or.kr/krcert/secNoticeView.do?bulletin_writing_sequence=35708"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.boho.or.kr/krcert/secNoticeView.do?bulletin_writing_sequence=35708"]},"summary":"Samsung Update 3.0.2.0 ~ 3.0.32.0 has a vulnerability that allows privilege escalation as commands crafted by attacker are executed while the engine deserializes the data received during inter-process communication","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:samsung:update:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:samsung:update:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:samsung:update:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
