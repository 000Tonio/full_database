Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the UPnP service, which listens on TCP port 5000. A crafted UPnP message can be used to bypass authentication. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root.
