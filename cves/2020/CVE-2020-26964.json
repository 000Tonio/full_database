The feature was implemented as a unix domain socket, protected by the Android SELinux policy; however, SELinux was not enforced for versions prior to 6.0. This was fixed by removing the Remote Debugging via USB feature from affected devices. *Note: This issue only affected Firefox for Android. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 83.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mozilla:firefox:80.0:*:*:*:*:android:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mozilla:firefox:80.0:*:*:*:*:android:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:google:android:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:google:android:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:mozilla:firefox:80.0:*:*:*:*:android:*:*"]}
