Doing so ensures that the available protection mechanisms in the language are intact and applicable. Filter all incoming data to escape or remove characters or strings that can be potentially misinterpreted as operating system or shell commands All application processes should be run with the minimal privileges required. Also, processes must shed privileges as soon as they no longer require them.","summary":"In this type of an attack, an adversary injects operating system commands into existing application functions. An application that uses untrusted input to build command strings is vulnerable. An adversary can leverage OS command injection in an application to elevate privileges, execute arbitrary commands and compromise the underlying operating system."},{"id":"137","name":"Parameter Injection","prerequisites":"The target application must use a parameter encoding where separators and parameter identifiers are expressed in regular text. The target application must accept a string as user input, fail to sanitize characters that have a special meaning in the parameter encoding, and insert the user-supplied string in an encoding which is then processed.","related_weakness":["88"],"solutions":"Implement an audit log written to a separate host. In the event of a compromise, the audit log may be able to provide evidence and details of the compromise. Treat all user input as untrusted data that must be validated before use.","summary":"An adversary manipulates the content of request parameters for the purpose of undermining the security of the target. Some parameter encodings use text characters as separators. For example, parameters in a HTTP GET message are encoded as name-value pairs separated by an ampersand (&). If an attacker can supply text strings that are used to fill in these parameters, then they can inject special characters used in the encoding scheme to add or modify parameters. For example, if user input is fed directly into an HTTP GET request and the user provides the value \"myInput&new_param=myValue\", then the input parameter is set to myInput, but a new parameter (new_param) is also added with a value of myValue. This can significantly change the meaning of the query that is processed by the server. Any encoding scheme where parameters are identified and separated by text characters is potentially vulnerable to this attack - the HTTP GET encoding used above is just one example."},{"id":"41","name":"Using Meta-characters in E-mail Headers to Inject Malicious Payloads","prerequisites":"This attack targets most widely deployed feature rich email applications, including web based email programs.","related_weakness":["150","697","713","88"],"solutions":"Design: Perform validation on email header data Implementation: Implement email filtering solutions on mail server or on MTA, relay server. Implementation: Mail servers that perform strict validation may catch these attacks, because metacharacters are not allowed in many header variables such as dns names","summary":"This type of attack involves an attacker leveraging meta-characters in email headers to inject improper behavior into email programs. Email software has become increasingly sophisticated and feature-rich. In addition, email applications are ubiquitous and connected directly to the Web making them ideal targets to launch and propagate attacks. As the user demand for new functionality in email applications grows, they become more like browsers with complex rendering and plug in routines. As more email functionality is included and abstracted from the user, this creates opportunities for attackers. Virtually all email applications do not list email header information by default, however the email header contains valuable attacker vectors for the attacker to exploit particularly if the behavior of the email client application is known. Meta-characters are hidden from the user, but can contain scripts, enumerations, probes, and other attacks against the user's system."},{"id":"460","name":"HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP)","prerequisites":"HTTP protocol is used with some GET/POST parameters passed","related_weakness":["147","235","88"],"solutions":"Implementation: Beware of multiple occurrences of a parameter in a Query String","summary":"An attacker overrides or adds HTTP GET/POST parameters by injecting query string delimiters. Via HPP it may be possible to override existing hardcoded HTTP parameters, modify the application behaviors, access and, potentially exploit, uncontrollable variables, and bypass input validation checkpoints and WAF rules."},{"id":"174","name":"Flash Parameter Injection","prerequisites":"","related_weakness":["88"],"solutions":"User input must be sanitized according to context before reflected back to the user. The JavaScript function 'encodeURI' is not always sufficient for sanitizing input intended for global Flash parameters. Extreme caution should be taken when saving user input in Flash cookies. In such cases the Flash file itself will need to be fixed and recompiled, changing the name of the local shared objects (Flash cookies).","summary":"An adversary takes advantage of improper data validation to inject malicious global parameters into a Flash file embedded within an HTML document. Flash files can leverage user-submitted data to configure the Flash document and access the embedding HTML document. These 'FlashVars' are most often passed to the Flash file via URL arguments or from the Object or Embed tag within the embedding HTML document. If these FlashVars are not properly sanitized, an adversary may be able to embed malicious content (such as scripts) into the HTML document. The injected parameters can also provide the adversary control over other objects within the Flash file as well as full control over the parent document's DOM model. As such, this is a form of HTTP parameter injection, but the abilities granted to the Flash document (such as access to a page's document model, including associated cookies) make this attack more flexible. Flash Parameter Injection attacks can also preface further attacks such as various forms of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks in addition to Session Hijacking attacks."}],"cvss":3.3,"cvss-time":"2020-11-10T14:22:00","cvss-vector":"AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-88","id":"CVE-2020-5657","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-11-10T14:22:00","references":["https://jvn.jp/vu/JVNVU92513419/index.html","https://www.mitsubishielectric.co.jp/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2020-012.pdf","https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2020-012_en.pdf"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://jvn.jp/vu/JVNVU92513419/index.html","https://www.mitsubishielectric.co.jp/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2020-012.pdf","https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2020-012_en.pdf"]},"summary":"Improper neutralization of argument delimiters in a command ('Argument Injection') vulnerability in TCP/IP function included in the firmware of MELSEC iQ-R series (RJ71EIP91 EtherNet/IP Network Interface Module First 2 digits of serial number are '02' or before, RJ71PN92 PROFINET IO Controller Module First 2 digits of serial number are '01' or before, RD81DL96 High Speed Data Logger Module First 2 digits of serial number are '08' or before, RD81MES96N MES Interface Module First 2 digits of serial number are '04' or before, and RD81OPC96 OPC UA Server Module First 2 digits of serial number are '04' or before) allows unauthenticated attackers on adjacent network to stop the network functions of the products via a specially crafted packet.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rj71eip91_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rj71eip91_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rj71eip91:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rj71eip91:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rj71pn92_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rj71pn92_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rj71pn92:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rj71pn92:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rd81dl96_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rd81dl96_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rd81dl96:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rd81dl96:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rd81mes96n_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rd81mes96n_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rd81mes96n:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rd81mes96n:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rd81opc96_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rd81opc96_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rd81opc96:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rd81opc96:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rj71eip91_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rj71pn92_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rd81dl96_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rd81mes96n_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:mitsubishielectric:melsec_iq-rd81opc96_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
