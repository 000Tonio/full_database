If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2021-05-13T16:00:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-36124","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-05-13T16:00:00","references":["https://marketing.paxtechnology.com/about-pax","https://www.whatspos.com/","https://blog.pridesec.com.br/p/4c972078-5f01-419e-8bea-cf31ff2e3670/"],"summary":"Pax Technology PAXSTORE v7.0.8_20200511171508 and lower is affected by XML External Entity (XXE) injection.
