A specially crafted document can cause the document parser to miscalculate a length used to allocate a buffer, later upon usage of this buffer the application will write outside its bounds resulting in a heap-based memory corruption. An attacker can entice the victim to open a document to trigger this vulnerability.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:softmaker:softmaker_office:2021:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:softmaker:softmaker_office:2021:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:softmaker:softmaker_office:2021:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
