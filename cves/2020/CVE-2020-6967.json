Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":10,"cvss-time":"2020-03-27T17:40:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-6967","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2020-03-27T17:40:00","references":["https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-051-02"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-051-02"]},"summary":"In Rockwell Automation all versions of FactoryTalk Diagnostics software, a subsystem of the FactoryTalk Services Platform, FactoryTalk Diagnostics exposes a .NET Remoting endpoint via RNADiagnosticsSrv.exe at TCPtcp/8082, which can insecurely deserialize untrusted data.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:rockwellautomation:factorytalk_services_platform:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:rockwellautomation:factorytalk_services_platform:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:rockwellautomation:factorytalk_services_platform:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
