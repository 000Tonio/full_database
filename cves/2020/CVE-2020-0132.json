Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":2.1,"cvss-time":"2021-07-21T11:39:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-0132","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-07-21T11:39:00","references":["https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/pixel/2020-06-01"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/pixel/2020-06-01"]},"summary":"In BnAAudioService::onTransact of IAAudioService.cpp, there is a possible out of bounds read due to unsafe deserialization.
