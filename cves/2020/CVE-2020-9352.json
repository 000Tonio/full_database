If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2022-04-18T15:58:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-9352","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-04-18T15:58:00","references":["https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Feb/18","https://blog.certimetergroup.com/it/articolo/security/smartclient-v12-xml-external-entity--cve-2020-9352"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://blog.certimetergroup.com/it/articolo/security/smartclient-v12-xml-external-entity--cve-2020-9352","https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Feb/18"]},"summary":"An issue was discovered in SmartClient 12.0.
