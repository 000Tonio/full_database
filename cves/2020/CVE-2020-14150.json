The bug reports were intended to show that a crash may occur in Bison itself, not that a crash may occur in code that is generated by Bison.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:gnu:bison:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:gnu:bison:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:gnu:bison:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
