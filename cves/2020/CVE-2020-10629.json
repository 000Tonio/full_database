If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2020-04-10T14:28:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-10629","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-04-10T14:28:00","references":["https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-098-01"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.us-cert.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-098-01"]},"summary":"WebAccess/NMS (versions prior to 3.0.2) does not sanitize XML input.
