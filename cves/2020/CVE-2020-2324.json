If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2020-12-07T19:54:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-2324","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-12-07T19:54:00","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/12/03/2","https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2020-12-03/#SECURITY-2146"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2020-12-03/#SECURITY-2146"],"mlist":["[oss-security] 20201203 Multiple vulnerabilities in Jenkins"]},"summary":"Jenkins CVS Plugin 2.16 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:cvs:2.16:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:cvs:2.16:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:cvs:2.16:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*"]}
