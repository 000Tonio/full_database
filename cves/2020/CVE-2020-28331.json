Affected Version(s): 2.5.1.8. The Barco wePresent WiPG-1600W device has an SSH daemon included in the firmware image. By default, the SSH daemon is disabled and does not start at system boot. The system initialization scripts read a device configuration file variable to see if the SSH daemon should be started. The web interface does not provide a visible capability to alter this configuration file variable. However, a malicious actor can include this variable in a POST such that the SSH daemon will be started when the device boots.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:barco:wepresent_wipg-1600w_firmware:2.5.1.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:barco:wepresent_wipg-1600w_firmware:2.5.1.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:barco:wepresent_wipg-1600w:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:barco:wepresent_wipg-1600w:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:barco:wepresent_wipg-1600w_firmware:2.5.1.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
