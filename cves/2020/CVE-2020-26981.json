If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2021-02-23T13:50:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-26981","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-02-23T13:50:00","references":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-622830.pdf","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-21-048/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-622830.pdf","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-21-048/"]},"summary":"A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.1.0), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.1.0).
