Design: Limit program privileges, so if metacharacters or other methods circumvent program input validation routines and shell access is attained then it is not running under a privileged account. chroot jails create a sandbox for the application to execute in, making it more difficult for an attacker to elevate privilege even in the case that a compromise has occurred. Implementation: Implement an audit log that is written to a separate host, in the event of a compromise the audit log may be able to provide evidence and details of the compromise.","summary":"An attacker changes the behavior or state of a targeted application through injecting data or command syntax through the targets use of non-validated and non-filtered arguments of exposed services or methods."},{"id":"15","name":"Command Delimiters","prerequisites":"Software's input validation or filtering must not detect and block presence of additional malicious command.","related_weakness":["138","140","146","154","157","184","185","697","713","77","78","93"],"solutions":"Design: Perform whitelist validation against a positive specification for command length, type, and parameters.

The system that uses a filter or a blacklist input validation, as opposed to whitelist validation is vulnerable to an attacker who predicts delimiters (or combinations of delimiters) not present in the filter or blacklist.

It may be necessary to implement redundant checking across different input validation layers. Ensure that invalid data is rejected as soon as possible and do not continue to work with it. Make sure to perform input validation on canonicalized data (i.e. data that is data in its most standard form). This will help avoid tricky encodings getting past the filters. Assume all input is malicious. Create a white list that defines all valid input to the software system based on the requirements specifications. Input that does not match against the white list should not be permitted to enter into the system.","summary":"An attacker supplies the target software with input data that contains sequences of special characters designed to bypass input validation logic. This exploit relies on the target making multiples passes over the input data and processing a \"layer\" of special characters with each pass. In this manner, the attacker can disguise input that would otherwise be rejected as invalid by concealing it with layers of special/escape characters that are stripped off by subsequent processing steps. The goal is to first discover cases where the input validation layer executes before one or more parsing layers. That is, user input may go through the following logic in an application: <parser1> --> <input validator> --> <parser2>. In such cases, the attacker will need to provide input that will pass through the input validator, but after passing through parser2, will be converted into something that the input validator was supposed to stop."}],"cvss":9.3,"cvss-time":"2020-02-02T04:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-78","id":"CVE-2020-1931","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2020-02-02T04:15:00","redhat":{"advisories":[{"bugzilla":{"id":"1802977","title":"CVE-2020-1930 spamassassin: command injection via crafted configuration file"},"oval":{"OR":[{"comment":"Red Hat Enterprise Linux must be installed","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhba:tst:20070304026"},{"AND":[{"comment":"Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is installed","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhba:tst:20193384074"},{"OR":[{"AND":[{"comment":"spamassassin is earlier than 0:3.4.2-10.el8","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20204625001"},{"comment":"spamassassin is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease2 key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20182916002"}]},{"AND":[{"comment":"spamassassin-debugsource is earlier than 0:3.4.2-10.el8","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20204625003"},{"comment":"spamassassin-debugsource is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease2 key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20204625004"}]}]}]}]},"rhsa":{"id":"RHSA-2020:4625","released":"2020-11-04","severity":"Moderate","title":"RHSA-2020:4625: spamassassin security update (Moderate)"}}],"rpms":["spamassassin-0:3.4.2-10.el8","spamassassin-debuginfo-0:3.4.2-10.el8","spamassassin-debugsource-0:3.4.2-10.el8"]},"references":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-04/msg00003.html","https://bz.apache.org/SpamAssassin/show_bug.cgi?id=7784","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/02/msg00015.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/B7SY2LUSH2X3IUXN4EQQ5A6QVUFYIV3D/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VOVVKFP2G2AF5GHAB4WMHOEX76A3H6CE/","https://seclists.org/bugtraq/2020/Feb/1","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4265-1/","https://usn.ubuntu.com/4265-2/","https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4615"],"refmap":{"bugtraq":["20200203 [SECURITY] [DSA 4615-1] spamassassin security update"],"confirm":["https://bz.apache.org/SpamAssassin/show_bug.cgi?id=7784"],"debian":["DSA-4615"],"fedora":["FEDORA-2020-24dac7d890","FEDORA-2020-bd20036cdc"],"mlist":["[debian-lts-announce] 20200218 [SECURITY] [DLA 2107-1] spamassassin security update"],"suse":["openSUSE-SU-2020:0446"],"ubuntu":["USN-4265-1","USN-4265-2"]},"summary":"A command execution issue was found in Apache SpamAssassin prior to 3.4.3.
