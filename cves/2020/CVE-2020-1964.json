Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2020-06-15T21:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-1964","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-06-15T21:15:00","references":["https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r16dd39f4180e4443ef4ca774a3a5a3d7ac69f91812c183ed2a99e959%40%3Cdev.heron.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rd43ae18588fd7bdb375be63bc95a651aab319ced6306759e1237ce67@%3Cdev.ignite.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/re7b43cf8333ee30b6589e465f72a6ed4a082222612d1a0fdd30beb94@%3Cdev.ignite.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/re7b43cf8333ee30b6589e465f72a6ed4a082222612d1a0fdd30beb94@%3Cuser.ignite.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf032a13a4711f88c0a2c0734eecbee1026cc1b6cde27d16a653f8755@%3Cdev.ignite.apache.org%3E"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r16dd39f4180e4443ef4ca774a3a5a3d7ac69f91812c183ed2a99e959%40%3Cdev.heron.apache.org%3E"],"mlist":["[ignite-dev] 20200605 Re: [CVE-2020-1963] Apache Ignite access to file system disclosure vulnerability","[ignite-dev] 20200608 Re: [CVE-2020-1963] Apache Ignite access to file system disclosure vulnerability","[ignite-dev] 20200615 Re: [CVE-2020-1963] Apache Ignite access to file system disclosure vulnerability","[ignite-user] 20200615 Re: [CVE-2020-1963] Apache Ignite access to file system disclosure vulnerability"]},"summary":"It was noticed that Apache Heron 0.20.2-incubating, Release 0.20.1-incubating, and Release v-0.20.0-incubating does not configure its YAML parser to prevent the instantiation of arbitrary types, resulting in a remote code execution vulnerabilities (CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data).","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:heron:0.20.0-incubating:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:heron:0.20.0-incubating:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:heron:0.20.1-incubating:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:heron:0.20.1-incubating:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:heron:0.20.2-incubating:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:heron:0.20.2-incubating:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:apache:heron:0.20.0-incubating:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:apache:heron:0.20.1-incubating:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:apache:heron:0.20.2-incubating:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
