When using a code book, application error messages aren't generated in string or stack trace form, but are catalogued and replaced with a unique (often integer-based) value 'coding' for the error. Such a technique will require helpdesk and hosting personnel to use a 'code book' or similar mapping to decode application errors/logs in order to respond to them normally. Design: wrap application functionality (preferably through the underlying framework) in an output encoding scheme that obscures or cleanses error messages to prevent such attacks. Such a technique is often used in conjunction with the above 'code book' suggestion. Implementation: Obfuscate server fields of HTTP response. Implementation: Hide inner ordering of HTTP response header. Implementation: Customizing HTTP error codes such as 404 or 500. Implementation: Hide HTTP response header software information filed. Implementation: Hide cookie's software information filed. Implementation: Obfuscate database type in Database API's error message.","summary":"An attacker sends random, malformed, or otherwise unexpected messages to a target application and observes the application's log or error messages returned. Fuzzing techniques involve sending random or malformed messages to a target and monitoring the target's response. The attacker does not initially know how a target will respond to individual messages but by attempting a large number of message variants they may find a variant that trigger's desired behavior. In this attack, the purpose of the fuzzing is to observe the application's log and error messages, although fuzzing a target can also sometimes cause the target to enter an unstable state, causing a crash. By observing logs and error messages, the attacker can learn details about the configuration of the target application and might be able to cause the target to disclose sensitive information."}],"cvss":6,"cvss-time":"2020-08-04T19:34:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-532","id":"CVE-2020-5414","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-08-04T19:34:00","references":["https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2020-5414"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://tanzu.vmware.com/security/cve-2020-5414"]},"summary":"VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (2.7.x versions prior to 2.7.19, 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.13, and 2.9.x versions prior to 2.9.7) contains an App Autoscaler that logs the UAA admin password. This credential is redacted on VMware Tanzu Operations Manager; however, the unredacted logs are available to authenticated users of the BOSH Director. This credential would grant administrative privileges to a malicious user. The same versions of App Autoscaler also log the App Autoscaler Broker password. Prior to newer versions of Operations Manager, this credential was not redacted from logs. This credential allows a malicious user to create, delete, and modify App Autoscaler services instances. Operations Manager started redacting this credential from logs as of its versions 2.7.15, 2.8.6, and 2.9.1. Note that these logs are typically only visible to foundation administrators and operators.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:vmware:tanzu_application_service_for_virtual_machines:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:vmware:tanzu_application_service_for_virtual_machines:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:vmware:tanzu_application_service_for_virtual_machines:2.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:vmware:tanzu_application_service_for_virtual_machines:2.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:vmware:tanzu_application_service_for_virtual_machines:2.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:vmware:tanzu_application_service_for_virtual_machines:2.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:vmware:operations_manager:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:vmware:operations_manager:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:vmware:operations_manager:2.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:vmware:operations_manager:2.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:vmware:operations_manager:2.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:vmware:operations_manager:2.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:vmware:tanzu_application_service_for_virtual_machines:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vmware:tanzu_application_service_for_virtual_machines:2.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vmware:tanzu_application_service_for_virtual_machines:2.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vmware:operations_manager:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vmware:operations_manager:2.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:vmware:operations_manager:2.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
