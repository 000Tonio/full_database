For example, a small amount of sniffed data may indicate that a vote was cast for the candidate with the least metadata. An active man-in-the-middle attacker can leverage this behavior to disrupt voters' abilities to vote for a candidate opposed by the attacker.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:voatz:voatz:2020-01-01:*:*:*:*:android:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:voatz:voatz:2020-01-01:*:*:*:*:android:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:voatz:voatz:2020-01-01:*:*:*:*:android:*:*"]}
