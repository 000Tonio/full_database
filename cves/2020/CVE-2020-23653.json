Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2021-01-19T19:28:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-23653","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-01-19T19:28:00","references":["https://github.com/zoujingli/ThinkAdmin/issues/238"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/zoujingli/ThinkAdmin/issues/238"]},"summary":"An insecure unserialize vulnerability was discovered in ThinkAdmin versions 4.x through 6.x in app/admin/controller/api/Update.php and app/wechat/controller/api/Push.php, which may lead to arbitrary remote code execution.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ctolog:thinkadmin:4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ctolog:thinkadmin:4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ctolog:thinkadmin:5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ctolog:thinkadmin:5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ctolog:thinkadmin:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ctolog:thinkadmin:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:ctolog:thinkadmin:4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ctolog:thinkadmin:5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ctolog:thinkadmin:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
