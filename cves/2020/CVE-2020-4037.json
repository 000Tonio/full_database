This is expected to be the original URL that the user was trying to access. This redirect URL is checked within the proxy and validated before redirecting the user to prevent malicious actors providing redirects to potentially harmful sites. This has been fixed in version 6.0.0.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:oauth2_proxy_project:oauth2_proxy:5.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:oauth2_proxy_project:oauth2_proxy:5.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:oauth2_proxy_project:oauth2_proxy:5.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
