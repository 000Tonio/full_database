Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2020-12-14T17:32:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-9301","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-12-14T17:32:00","references":["https://github.com/Netflix/security-bulletins/blob/master/advisories/nflx-2020-006.md"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://github.com/Netflix/security-bulletins/blob/master/advisories/nflx-2020-006.md"]},"summary":"Nolan Ray from Apple Information Security identified a security vulnerability in Spinnaker, all versions prior to version 1.23.4, 1.22.4 or 1.21.5.
