Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2022-05-11T14:35:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-23621","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-05-11T14:35:00","references":["https://www.squire-technologies.co.uk/","https://github.com/joaomatosf/jexboss","https://gist.github.com/fuzzKitty/dd1c6fac4f36e70ea64814732726aaea"],"summary":"The Java Remote Management Interface of all versions of SVI MS Management System was discovered to contain a vulnerability due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied content, which can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted serialized Java object.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:squire-technologies:svi_ms_management_system:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:squire-technologies:svi_ms_management_system:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:squire-technologies:svi_ms_management_system:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
