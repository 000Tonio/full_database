Use secure functions not vulnerable to buffer overflow. If you have to use dangerous functions, make sure that you do boundary checking.

Use OS-level preventative functionality. Not a complete solution.

As a consequence, an adversary is able to write past the boundaries of allocated buffer regions in memory, causing a program crash or potentially redirection of execution as per the adversaries' choice."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2021-08-03T19:02:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-129","id":"CVE-2020-18430","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-08-03T19:02:00","references":["https://github.com/ChijinZ/security_advisories/tree/master/tinyexr_65f9859","https://github.com/syoyo/tinyexr/issues/108"],"summary":"tinyexr 0.9.5 was discovered to contain an array index error in the tinyexr::DecodeEXRImage component, which can lead to a denial of service (DOS).","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:tinyexr_project:tinyexr:0.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:tinyexr_project:tinyexr:0.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:tinyexr_project:tinyexr:0.9.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
