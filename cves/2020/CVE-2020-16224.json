The expanded parameter is used in the context where buffer overflow may become possible due to the incorrect understanding of the parameter size (i.e. thinking that it is smaller than it really is).","related_weakness":["118","119","120","130","131","20","680","697","74"],"solutions":"Ensure that when parameter expansion happens in the code that the assumptions used to determine the resulting size of the parameter are accurate and that the new size of the parameter is visible to the whole system","summary":"In this attack, the target software is given input that the attacker knows will be modified and expanded in size during processing. This attack relies on the target software failing to anticipate that the expanded data may exceed some internal limit, thereby creating a buffer overflow."}],"cvss":3.3,"cvss-time":"2020-09-15T18:18:00","cvss-vector":"AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-130","id":"CVE-2020-16224","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-09-15T18:18:00","references":["https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/icsma-20-254-01"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/icsma-20-254-01"]},"summary":"Patient Information Center iX (PICiX) Versions B.02, C.02, C.03, PerformanceBridge Focal Point Version A.01, IntelliVue patient monitors MX100, MX400-MX850, and MP2-MP90 Versions N and prior, IntelliVue X3 and X2 Versions N and prior.
