If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.4,"cvss-time":"2021-11-02T17:33:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-25911","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-11-02T17:33:00","references":["https://github.com/dahua966/Vul_disclose/blob/main/XXE_modxcms.md","https://github.com/modxcms/revolution/issues/15237"],"summary":"A XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability was discovered in the modRestServiceRequest component in MODX CMS 2.7.3 which can lead to an information disclosure or denial of service (DOS).","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:modx:modx_revolution:2.7.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:modx:modx_revolution:2.7.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:modx:modx_revolution:2.7.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
