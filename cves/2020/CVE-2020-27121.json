The vulnerability is due to improper handling of login requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted client login request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a process to crash, resulting in a DoS condition for new login attempts. Users who are authenticated at the time of the attack would not be affected. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager_im_and_presence_service:12.5\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager_im_and_presence_service:12.5\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_communications_manager_im_and_presence_service:12.5\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
