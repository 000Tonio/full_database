The system that uses a filter or a blacklist input validation, as opposed to whitelist validation is vulnerable to an attacker who predicts delimiters (or combinations of delimiters) not present in the filter or blacklist.

It may be necessary to implement redundant checking across different input validation layers. Ensure that invalid data is rejected as soon as possible and do not continue to work with it. Make sure to perform input validation on canonicalized data (i.e. data that is data in its most standard form). This will help avoid tricky encodings getting past the filters. Assume all input is malicious. Create a white list that defines all valid input to the software system based on the requirements specifications. Input that does not match against the white list should not be permitted to enter into the system.","summary":"An attacker supplies the target software with input data that contains sequences of special characters designed to bypass input validation logic. This exploit relies on the target making multiples passes over the input data and processing a \"layer\" of special characters with each pass. In this manner, the attacker can disguise input that would otherwise be rejected as invalid by concealing it with layers of special/escape characters that are stripped off by subsequent processing steps. The goal is to first discover cases where the input validation layer executes before one or more parsing layers. That is, user input may go through the following logic in an application: <parser1> --> <input validator> --> <parser2>. In such cases, the attacker will need to provide input that will pass through the input validator, but after passing through parser2, will be converted into something that the input validator was supposed to stop."}],"cvss":6.4,"cvss-time":"2021-11-30T21:43:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-78","id":"CVE-2020-26259","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-11-30T21:43:00","references":["https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2020-26259.html","https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-jfvx-7wrx-43fh","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r97993e3d78e1f5389b7b172ba9f308440830ce5f051ee62714a0aa34@%3Ccommits.struts.apache.org%3E","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/12/msg00042.html","https://www.debian.org/security/2021/dsa-4828","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20210409-0005/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/22KVR6B5IZP3BGQ3HPWIO2FWWCKT3DHP/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QGXIU3YDPG6OGTDHMBLAFN7BPBERXREB/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/PVPHZA7VW2RRSDCOIPP2W6O5ND254TU7/"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://github.com/x-stream/xstream/security/advisories/GHSA-jfvx-7wrx-43fh"],"debian":["DSA-4828"],"misc":["https://x-stream.github.io/CVE-2020-26259.html"],"mlist":["[debian-lts-announce] 20201231 [SECURITY] [DLA 2507-1] libxstream-java security update","[struts-commits] 20201221 [struts] branch master updated: Upgrades XStream to version 1.4.15 to address CVE-2020-26258, CVE-2020-26259"]},"summary":"XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again. In XStream before version 1.4.15, is vulnerable to an Arbitrary File Deletion on the local host when unmarshalling. The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to delete arbitrary know files on the host as log as the executing process has sufficient rights only by manipulating the processed input stream. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.15. The reported vulnerability does not exist running Java 15 or higher. No user is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's Security Framework with a whitelist! Anyone relying on XStream's default blacklist can immediately switch to a whilelist for the allowed types to avoid the vulnerability. Users of XStream 1.4.14 or below who still want to use XStream default blacklist can use a workaround described in more detailed in the referenced
