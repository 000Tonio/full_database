For example, adding one to the largest positive integer in a signed integer variable results in a negative number. Negative numbers may be illegal in an application and the application may prevent an attacker from providing them directly, but the application may not consider that adding two positive numbers can create a negative number do to the structure of integer storage formats."},{"id":"129","name":"Pointer Manipulation","prerequisites":"The target application must have a pointer variable that the attacker can influence to hold an arbitrary value.","related_weakness":["682","822","823"],"solutions":"","summary":"This attack pattern involves an adversary manipulating a pointer within a target application resulting in the application accessing an unintended memory location. This can result in the crashing of the application or, for certain pointer values, access to data that would not normally be possible or the execution of arbitrary code. Since pointers are simply integer variables, Integer Attacks may often be used in Pointer Attacks."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2021-07-21T11:39:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-682","id":"CVE-2020-1026","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-07-21T11:39:00","references":["https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1026"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1026"]},"summary":"A Security Feature Bypass vulnerability exists in the MSR JavaScript Cryptography Library that is caused by multiple bugs in the libraryâ€™s Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) implementation.An attacker could potentially abuse these bugs to learn information about a serverâ€™s private ECC key (a key leakage attack) or craft an invalid ECDSA signature that nevertheless passes as valid.The security update addresses the vulnerability by fixing the bugs disclosed in the ECC implementation, aka 'MSR JavaScript Cryptography Library Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability'.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:research_javascript_cryptography_library:1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:research_javascript_cryptography_library:1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:research_javascript_cryptography_library:1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
