Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2020-10-08T16:20:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-15172","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-10-08T16:20:00","references":["https://github.com/zephyrkul/FluffyCogs/commit/6b9f3b862e1f0a5429c62f3090f814e53a242347","https://github.com/zephyrkul/FluffyCogs/security/advisories/GHSA-rm7m-j4xp-rv2p"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://github.com/zephyrkul/FluffyCogs/security/advisories/GHSA-rm7m-j4xp-rv2p"],"misc":["https://github.com/zephyrkul/FluffyCogs/commit/6b9f3b862e1f0a5429c62f3090f814e53a242347"]},"summary":"The Act module for Red Discord Bot before commit 6b9f3b86 is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution.
