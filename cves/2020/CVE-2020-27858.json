If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2021-01-27T14:34:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-27858","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-01-27T14:34:00","references":["https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-20-1397/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-20-1397/"]},"summary":"This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of CA Arcserve D2D 16.5. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the getNews method. Due to the improper restriction of XML External Entity (XXE) references, a specially-crafted document specifying a URI causes the XML parser to access the URI and embed the contents back into the XML document for further processing. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose information in the context of SYSTEM.
