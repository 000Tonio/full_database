Exported functions by the package can be tricked into adding or modifying properties of the `Object.prototype`. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires creation of a new directory where an attack code can be placed which will then be exported by `express-mock-middleware`. As such, this is considered to be a low risk.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:express-mock-middleware_project:express-mock-middleware:0.0.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:express-mock-middleware_project:express-mock-middleware:0.0.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:express-mock-middleware_project:express-mock-middleware:0.0.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
