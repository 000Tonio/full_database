If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2020-02-20T20:49:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-1693","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-02-20T20:49:00","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-1693","https://github.com/spacewalkproject/spacewalk/commit/74e28ec61d916c42061ef4347121650a1c962b0c","https://zeroauth.ltd/blog/2020/02/18/proof-of-concept-exploit-for-cve-2020-1693-spacewalk/"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2020-1693"],"misc":["https://github.com/spacewalkproject/spacewalk/commit/74e28ec61d916c42061ef4347121650a1c962b0c","https://zeroauth.ltd/blog/2020/02/18/proof-of-concept-exploit-for-cve-2020-1693-spacewalk/"]},"summary":"A flaw was found in Spacewalk up to version 2.9 where it was vulnerable to XML internal entity attacks via the /rpc/api endpoint.
