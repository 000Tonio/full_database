Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2021-02-02T18:44:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-27583","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-02-02T18:44:00","references":["https://n4nj0.github.io/advisories/ibm-infosphere-java-deserialization/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://n4nj0.github.io/advisories/ibm-infosphere-java-deserialization/"]},"summary":"** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** IBM InfoSphere Information Server 8.5.0.0 is affected by deserialization of untrusted data which could allow remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code.
