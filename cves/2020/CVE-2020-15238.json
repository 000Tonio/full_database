Doing so ensures that the available protection mechanisms in the language are intact and applicable. Filter all incoming data to escape or remove characters or strings that can be potentially misinterpreted as operating system or shell commands All application processes should be run with the minimal privileges required. Also, processes must shed privileges as soon as they no longer require them.","summary":"In this type of an attack, an adversary injects operating system commands into existing application functions. An application that uses untrusted input to build command strings is vulnerable. An adversary can leverage OS command injection in an application to elevate privileges, execute arbitrary commands and compromise the underlying operating system."},{"id":"137","name":"Parameter Injection","prerequisites":"The target application must use a parameter encoding where separators and parameter identifiers are expressed in regular text. The target application must accept a string as user input, fail to sanitize characters that have a special meaning in the parameter encoding, and insert the user-supplied string in an encoding which is then processed.","related_weakness":["88"],"solutions":"Implement an audit log written to a separate host. In the event of a compromise, the audit log may be able to provide evidence and details of the compromise. Treat all user input as untrusted data that must be validated before use.","summary":"An adversary manipulates the content of request parameters for the purpose of undermining the security of the target. Some parameter encodings use text characters as separators. For example, parameters in a HTTP GET message are encoded as name-value pairs separated by an ampersand (&). If an attacker can supply text strings that are used to fill in these parameters, then they can inject special characters used in the encoding scheme to add or modify parameters. For example, if user input is fed directly into an HTTP GET request and the user provides the value \"myInput&new_param=myValue\", then the input parameter is set to myInput, but a new parameter (new_param) is also added with a value of myValue. This can significantly change the meaning of the query that is processed by the server. Any encoding scheme where parameters are identified and separated by text characters is potentially vulnerable to this attack - the HTTP GET encoding used above is just one example."},{"id":"41","name":"Using Meta-characters in E-mail Headers to Inject Malicious Payloads","prerequisites":"This attack targets most widely deployed feature rich email applications, including web based email programs.","related_weakness":["150","697","713","88"],"solutions":"Design: Perform validation on email header data Implementation: Implement email filtering solutions on mail server or on MTA, relay server. Implementation: Mail servers that perform strict validation may catch these attacks, because metacharacters are not allowed in many header variables such as dns names","summary":"This type of attack involves an attacker leveraging meta-characters in email headers to inject improper behavior into email programs. Email software has become increasingly sophisticated and feature-rich. In addition, email applications are ubiquitous and connected directly to the Web making them ideal targets to launch and propagate attacks. As the user demand for new functionality in email applications grows, they become more like browsers with complex rendering and plug in routines. As more email functionality is included and abstracted from the user, this creates opportunities for attackers. Virtually all email applications do not list email header information by default, however the email header contains valuable attacker vectors for the attacker to exploit particularly if the behavior of the email client application is known. Meta-characters are hidden from the user, but can contain scripts, enumerations, probes, and other attacks against the user's system."},{"id":"460","name":"HTTP Parameter Pollution (HPP)","prerequisites":"HTTP protocol is used with some GET/POST parameters passed","related_weakness":["147","235","88"],"solutions":"Implementation: Beware of multiple occurrences of a parameter in a Query String","summary":"An attacker overrides or adds HTTP GET/POST parameters by injecting query string delimiters.

The JavaScript function 'encodeURI' is not always sufficient for sanitizing input intended for global Flash parameters. Extreme caution should be taken when saving user input in Flash cookies. In such cases the Flash file itself will need to be fixed and recompiled, changing the name of the local shared objects (Flash cookies).","summary":"An adversary takes advantage of improper data validation to inject malicious global parameters into a Flash file embedded within an HTML document. Flash files can leverage user-submitted data to configure the Flash document and access the embedding HTML document. These 'FlashVars' are most often passed to the Flash file via URL arguments or from the Object or Embed tag within the embedding HTML document. If these FlashVars are not properly sanitized, an adversary may be able to embed malicious content (such as scripts) into the HTML document. The injected parameters can also provide the adversary control over other objects within the Flash file as well as full control over the parent document's DOM model. As such, this is a form of HTTP parameter injection, but the abilities granted to the Flash document (such as access to a page's document model, including associated cookies) make this attack more flexible. Flash Parameter Injection attacks can also preface further attacks such as various forms of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks in addition to Session Hijacking attacks."}],"cvss":6.9,"cvss-time":"2021-11-18T16:25:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-88","id":"CVE-2020-15238","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2021-11-18T16:25:00","references":["https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/blueman/+bug/1897287","https://github.com/blueman-project/blueman/releases/tag/2.1.4","https://github.com/blueman-project/blueman/security/advisories/GHSA-jpc9-mgw6-2xwx","https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4781","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/159740/Blueman-Local-Root-Privilege-Escalation.html","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/11/msg00005.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/6CFLMNHAHX5HPIKC5IG6F25HO5Z6RH2N/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/W52NP7HRFTNAVNZLGKY4GR3JIZG5KKGS/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/3F4EQU6CAPBKAPJ42HTB473NJLXFKB32/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202011-11"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://github.com/blueman-project/blueman/security/advisories/GHSA-jpc9-mgw6-2xwx"],"debian":["DSA-4781"],"fedora":["FEDORA-2020-7c22b25a07","FEDORA-2020-e083225fa1","FEDORA-2020-ebabb6bf76"],"gentoo":["GLSA-202011-11"],"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/159740/Blueman-Local-Root-Privilege-Escalation.html","https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/blueman/+bug/1897287","https://github.com/blueman-project/blueman/releases/tag/2.1.4"],"mlist":["[debian-lts-announce] 20201103 [SECURITY] [DLA 2430-1] blueman security update"]},"summary":"Blueman is a GTK+ Bluetooth Manager. In Blueman before 2.1.4, the DhcpClient method of the D-Bus interface to blueman-mechanism is prone to an argument injection vulnerability. The impact highly depends on the system configuration. If Polkit-1 is disabled and for versions lower than 2.0.6, any local user can possibly exploit this. If Polkit-1 is enabled for version 2.0.6 and later, a possible attacker needs to be allowed to use the `org.blueman.dhcp.client` action. That is limited to users in the wheel group in the shipped rules file that do have the privileges anyway. On systems with ISC DHCP client (dhclient), attackers can pass arguments to `ip link` with the interface name that can e.g. be used to bring down an interface or add an arbitrary XDP/BPF program. On systems with dhcpcd and without ISC DHCP client, attackers can even run arbitrary scripts by passing `-c/path/to/script` as an interface name. Patches are included in 2.1.4 and master that change the DhcpClient D-Bus method(s) to accept BlueZ network object paths instead of network interface names. A backport to 2.0(.8) is also available. As a workaround, make sure that Polkit-1-support is enabled and limit privileges for the `org.blueman.dhcp.client` action to users that are able to run arbitrary commands as root anyway in /usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/blueman.rules.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:1.99:alpha1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:1.99:alpha1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:1.99:alpha2:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:1.99:alpha2:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1:alpha1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1:alpha1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1:alpha2:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1:alpha2:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1:alpha3:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1:alpha3:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:31:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:31:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:1.99:alpha1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:1.99:alpha2:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.0.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1:alpha1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1:alpha2:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1:alpha3:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:blueman_project:blueman:2.1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:31:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:33:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
