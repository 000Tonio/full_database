No (or broken) access control checks exist on the /api/document/<DocumentID>/attachments API endpoint. Knowing a document ID, an attacker can list all the attachments of a workitem, including their respective IDs. This allows the attacker to gather valid attachment IDs for workitems that do not belong to them.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:tangro:business_workflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:tangro:business_workflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:tangro:business_workflow:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
