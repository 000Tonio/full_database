Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2020-06-26T19:34:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-14942","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-06-26T19:34:00","references":["https://github.com/tendenci/tendenci/issues/867"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/tendenci/tendenci/issues/867"]},"summary":"Tendenci 12.0.10 allows unrestricted deserialization in apps\\helpdesk\\views\\staff.py.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:tendenci:tendenci:12.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:tendenci:tendenci:12.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:tendenci:tendenci:12.0.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
