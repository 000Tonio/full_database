A specially crafted I/O request packet (IRP) Using the IRP 0x9c4060cc gives a low privilege user direct access to the IN instruction that is completely unrestrained at an elevated privilege level. An attacker can send a malicious IRP to trigger this vulnerability and this access could allow for information leakage of sensitive data.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:nzxt:cam:4.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:nzxt:cam:4.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:nzxt:cam:4.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
