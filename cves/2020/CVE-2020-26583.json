The default security setting must be to deny access and then grant access only to those resources intended by business logic.","summary":"In applications, particularly web applications, access to functionality is mitigated by an authorization framework. This framework maps Access Control Lists (ACLs) to elements of the application's functionality; particularly URL's for web apps. In the case that the administrator failed to specify an ACL for a particular element, an attacker may be able to access it with impunity. An attacker with the ability to access functionality not properly constrained by ACLs can obtain sensitive information and possibly compromise the entire application. Such an attacker can access resources that must be available only to users at a higher privilege level, can access management sections of the application, or can run queries for data that they otherwise not supposed to."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2020-10-29T19:46:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N","cwe":"CWE-434","id":"CVE-2020-26583","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-10-29T19:46:00","references":["https://sec-consult.com/en/vulnerability-lab/advisories/","https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Oct/17","https://www.sagedpw.at"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://sec-consult.com/en/vulnerability-lab/advisories/","https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Oct/17","https://www.sagedpw.at"]},"summary":"An issue was discovered in Sage DPW 2020_06_x before 2020_06_002. It allows unauthenticated users to upload JavaScript (in a file) via the expenses claiming functionality. However, to view the file, authentication is required. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can persistently include arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the affected web page. The vulnerability can be used to change the contents of the displayed site, redirect to other sites, or steal user credentials. Additionally, users are potential victims of browser exploits and JavaScript malware.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sagedpw:sage_dpw:2020_06_000:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sagedpw:sage_dpw:2020_06_000:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sagedpw:sage_dpw:2020_06_001:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sagedpw:sage_dpw:2020_06_001:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sagedpw:sage_dpw:2020_06_000:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:sagedpw:sage_dpw:2020_06_001:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
