If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5.5,"cvss-time":"2020-10-19T20:20:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-4772","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-10-19T20:20:00","references":["https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/189150","https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6344069"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6344069"],"xf":["ibm-curam-cve20204772-xxe (189150)"]},"summary":"An XML External Entity Injection (XXE) vulnerability may impact IBM Curam Social Program Management 7.0.9 and 7.0.10.
