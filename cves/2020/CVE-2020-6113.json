The expanded parameter is used in the context where buffer overflow may become possible due to the incorrect understanding of the parameter size (i.e. thinking that it is smaller than it really is).","related_weakness":["118","119","120","130","131","20","680","697","74"],"solutions":"Ensure that when parameter expansion happens in the code that the assumptions used to determine the resulting size of the parameter are accurate and that the new size of the parameter is visible to the whole system","summary":"In this attack, the target software is given input that the attacker knows will be modified and expanded in size during processing.

Use secure functions not vulnerable to buffer overflow. If you have to use dangerous functions, make sure that you do boundary checking.

Use OS-level preventative functionality. Not a complete solution.

When processing an object stream from a PDF document, the application will perform a calculation in order to allocate memory for the list of indirect objects. Due to an error when calculating this size, an integer overflow may occur which can result in an undersized buffer being allocated. Later when initializing this buffer, the application can write outside its bounds which can cause a memory corruption that can lead to code execution. A specially crafted document can be delivered to a victim in order to trigger this vulnerability.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:gonitro:nitro_pro:13.16.2.300:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:gonitro:nitro_pro:13.16.2.300:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:gonitro:nitro_pro:13.13.2.242:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:gonitro:nitro_pro:13.13.2.242:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:gonitro:nitro_pro:13.16.2.300:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:gonitro:nitro_pro:13.13.2.242:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
