Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2020-06-26T19:03:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-14932","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-06-26T19:03:00","references":["https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/06/20/1"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/06/20/1"]},"summary":"compose.php in SquirrelMail 1.4.22 calls unserialize for the $mailtodata value, which originates from an HTTP GET request.
