If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.4,"cvss-time":"2020-10-08T19:34:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-21524","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-10-08T19:34:00","references":["https://github.com/halo-dev/halo/issues/423"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/halo-dev/halo/issues/423"]},"summary":"There is a XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in halo v1.1.3, The function of importing other blogs in the background(/api/admin/migrations/wordpress) needs to parse the xml file, but it is not used for security defense, This vulnerability can detect the intranet, read files, enable ddos attacks, etc. exp:https://github.com/halo-dev/halo/issues/423","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:halo:halo:1.1.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:halo:halo:1.1.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:halo:halo:1.1.3:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
