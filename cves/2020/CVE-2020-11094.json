When using a code book, application error messages aren't generated in string or stack trace form, but are catalogued and replaced with a unique (often integer-based) value 'coding' for the error. Such a technique will require helpdesk and hosting personnel to use a 'code book' or similar mapping to decode application errors/logs in order to respond to them normally. Design: wrap application functionality (preferably through the underlying framework) in an output encoding scheme that obscures or cleanses error messages to prevent such attacks. Such a technique is often used in conjunction with the above 'code book' suggestion. Implementation: Obfuscate server fields of HTTP response. Implementation: Hide inner ordering of HTTP response header. Implementation: Customizing HTTP error codes such as 404 or 500. Implementation: Hide HTTP response header software information filed. Implementation: Hide cookie's software information filed. Implementation: Obfuscate database type in Database API's error message.","summary":"An attacker sends random, malformed, or otherwise unexpected messages to a target application and observes the application's log or error messages returned. Fuzzing techniques involve sending random or malformed messages to a target and monitoring the target's response. The attacker does not initially know how a target will respond to individual messages but by attempting a large number of message variants they may find a variant that trigger's desired behavior. In this attack, the purpose of the fuzzing is to observe the application's log and error messages, although fuzzing a target can also sometimes cause the target to enter an unstable state, causing a crash. By observing logs and error messages, the attacker can learn details about the configuration of the target application and might be able to cause the target to disclose sensitive information."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2020-06-10T13:53:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-532","id":"CVE-2020-11094","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-06-10T13:53:00","references":["https://github.com/rainlab/debugbar-plugin/commit/86dd29f9866d712de7d98f5f9dc67751b82ecd18","https://github.com/rainlab/debugbar-plugin/security/advisories/GHSA-c8wh-6jw4-2h79"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://github.com/rainlab/debugbar-plugin/security/advisories/GHSA-c8wh-6jw4-2h79"],"misc":["https://github.com/rainlab/debugbar-plugin/commit/86dd29f9866d712de7d98f5f9dc67751b82ecd18"]},"summary":"The October CMS debugbar plugin before version 3.1.0 contains a feature where it will log all requests (and all information pertaining to each request including session data) whenever it is enabled. This presents a problem if the plugin is ever enabled on a system that is open to untrusted users as the potential exists for them to use this feature to view all requests being made to the application and obtain sensitive information from those requests. There even exists the potential for account takeovers of authenticated users by non-authenticated public users, which would then lead to a number of other potential issues as an attacker could theoretically get full access to the system if the required conditions existed. Issue has been patched in v3.1.0 by locking down access to the debugbar to all users; it now requires an authenticated backend user with a specifically enabled permission before it is even usable, and the feature that allows access to stored request information is restricted behind a different permission that's more restrictive.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:2.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:2.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:2.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:2.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:3.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:3.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:1.0.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:2.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:2.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:octobercms:debugbar:3.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
