If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2020-07-22T15:54:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-12684","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-07-22T15:54:00","references":["https://www.inetsoftware.de/documentation/clear-reports/release-notes/releases","https://www.inetsoftware.de/documentation/clear-reports/release-notes/releases/changes_20.4"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://www.inetsoftware.de/documentation/clear-reports/release-notes/releases/changes_20.4"],"misc":["https://www.inetsoftware.de/documentation/clear-reports/release-notes/releases"]},"summary":"XXE injection can occur in i-net Clear Reports 2019 19.0.287 (Designer), as used in i-net HelpDesk and other products, when XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:inetsoftware:i-net_clear_reports:19.0.287:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:inetsoftware:i-net_clear_reports:19.0.287:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:inetsoftware:i-net_clear_reports:19.0.287:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
