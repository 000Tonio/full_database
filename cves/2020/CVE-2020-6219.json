Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2020-04-15T16:23:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-6219","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-04-15T16:23:00","references":["https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2863731","https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=544214202"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2863731","https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=544214202"]},"summary":"SAP Business Objects Business Intelligence Platform (CrystalReports WebForm Viewer), versions 4.1, 4.2, and Crystal Reports for VS version 2010, allows an attacker with basic authorization to perform deserialization attack in the application, leading to service interruptions and denial of service and unauthorized execution of arbitrary commands, leading to Deserialization of Untrusted Data.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:businessobjects_business_intelligence_platform:4.1:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:businessobjects_business_intelligence_platform:4.1:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:businessobjects_business_intelligence_platform:4.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:businessobjects_business_intelligence_platform:4.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:crystal_reports_for_visual_studio:2010:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:crystal_reports_for_visual_studio:2010:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sap:businessobjects_business_intelligence_platform:4.1:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:sap:businessobjects_business_intelligence_platform:4.2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:sap:crystal_reports_for_visual_studio:2010:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
