Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":10,"cvss-time":"2020-05-27T21:03:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-3280","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2020-05-27T21:03:00","references":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-uccx-rce-GMSC6RKN"],"refmap":{"cisco":["20200520 Cisco Unified Contact Center Express Remote Code Execution Vulnerability"]},"summary":"A vulnerability in the Java Remote Management Interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insecure deserialization of user-supplied content by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious serialized Java object to a specific listener on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on an affected device.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_contact_center_express:12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_contact_center_express:12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_contact_center_express:12.0\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_contact_center_express:12.0\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_contact_center_express:12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cisco:unified_contact_center_express:12.0\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
