If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2021-08-23T20:32:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-18705","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-08-23T20:32:00","references":["https://github.com/rochacbruno/quokka/issues/676"],"summary":"XML External Entities (XXE) in Quokka v0.4.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the component 'quokka/core/content/views.py'.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:quokka_project:quokka:0.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:quokka_project:quokka:0.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:quokka_project:quokka:0.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
