This can be a problem with encrypting deterministic AEAD with a single key, and rely on a unique ciphertext-per-plaintext.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:google:tink:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:google:tink:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:google:tink:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
