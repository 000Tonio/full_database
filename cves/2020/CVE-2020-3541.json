When using a code book, application error messages aren't generated in string or stack trace form, but are catalogued and replaced with a unique (often integer-based) value 'coding' for the error. Such a technique will require helpdesk and hosting personnel to use a 'code book' or similar mapping to decode application errors/logs in order to respond to them normally. Design: wrap application functionality (preferably through the underlying framework) in an output encoding scheme that obscures or cleanses error messages to prevent such attacks. Such a technique is often used in conjunction with the above 'code book' suggestion. Implementation: Obfuscate server fields of HTTP response. Implementation: Hide inner ordering of HTTP response header. Implementation: Customizing HTTP error codes such as 404 or 500. Implementation: Hide HTTP response header software information filed. Implementation: Hide cookie's software information filed. Implementation: Obfuscate database type in Database API's error message.","summary":"An attacker sends random, malformed, or otherwise unexpected messages to a target application and observes the application's log or error messages returned. Fuzzing techniques involve sending random or malformed messages to a target and monitoring the target's response. The attacker does not initially know how a target will respond to individual messages but by attempting a large number of message variants they may find a variant that trigger's desired behavior. In this attack, the purpose of the fuzzing is to observe the application's log and error messages, although fuzzing a target can also sometimes cause the target to enter an unstable state, causing a crash. By observing logs and error messages, the attacker can learn details about the configuration of the target application and might be able to cause the target to disclose sensitive information."}],"cvss":2.1,"cvss-time":"2020-09-09T19:11:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-532","id":"CVE-2020-3541","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-09-09T19:11:00","references":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-media-znjfwHD6"],"refmap":{"cisco":["20200902 Cisco Webex Meetings Client for Windows, Webex Meetings Desktop App, and Webex Teams Information Disclosure Vulnerability"]},"summary":"A vulnerability in the media engine component of Cisco Webex Meetings Client for Windows, Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App for Windows, and Cisco Webex Teams for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain access to sensitive information. The vulnerability is due to unsafe logging of authentication requests by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by reading log files that are stored in the application directory. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive information, which could be used in further attacks.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings:*:*:*:*:desktop:windows:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings:*:*:*:*:desktop:windows:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings:40.6.0:*:*:*:desktop:windows:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings:40.6.0:*:*:*:desktop:windows:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_teams:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_teams:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings:*:*:*:*:desktop:windows:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_meetings:40.6.0:*:*:*:desktop:windows:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cisco:webex_teams:*:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*"]}
