The infiltration purpose is to alter developed hardware components in a system destined for deployment at the victim's organization, for the purpose of disruption or further compromise."},{"id":"540","name":"Overread Buffers","prerequisites":"For this type of attack to be successful, a few prerequisites must be met. First, the targeted software must be written in a language that enables fine grained buffer control. (e.g., c, c++) Second, the targeted software must actually perform buffer operations and inadequately perform bounds-checking on those buffer operations. Finally, the adversary must have the capability to influence the input that guides these buffer operations.","related_weakness":["125"],"solutions":"","summary":"An adversary attacks a target by providing input that causes an application to read beyond the boundary of a defined buffer. This typically occurs when a value influencing where to start or stop reading is set to reflect positions outside of the valid memory location of the buffer. This type of attack may result in exposure of sensitive information, a system crash, or arbitrary code execution."}],"cvss":7.8,"cvss-time":"2020-10-07T17:32:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C","cwe":"CWE-125","id":"CVE-2020-3399","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-10-07T17:32:00","references":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-capwap-dos-ShFzXf"],"refmap":{"cisco":["20200924 Cisco IOS XE Wireless Controller Software for the Catalyst 9000 Family CAPWAP Denial of Service Vulnerability"]},"summary":"A vulnerability in the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) protocol processing of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition of an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation during CAPWAP packet processing. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted CAPWAP packet to an affected device, resulting in a buffer over-read. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to crash and reload, resulting in a DoS condition on the affected device.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.12.1s:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.12.1s:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.12.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.12.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:cisco:catalyst_9800-40:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:cisco:catalyst_9800-40:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:cisco:catalyst_9800-80:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:cisco:catalyst_9800-80:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:cisco:catalyst_9800-cl:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:cisco:catalyst_9800-cl:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:cisco:catalyst_9800-l:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:cisco:catalyst_9800-l:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:cisco:catalyst_9800-l-c:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:cisco:catalyst_9800-l-c:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:cisco:catalyst_9800-l-f:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:cisco:catalyst_9800-l-f:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.12.1s:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.12.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
