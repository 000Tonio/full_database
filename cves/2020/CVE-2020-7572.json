If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2022-01-31T19:45:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-7572","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-01-31T19:45:00","references":["https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/SEVD-2020-315-04/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/SEVD-2020-315-04/"]},"summary":"A CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference vulnerability exists in EcoStruxure Building Operation WebReports V1.9 - V3.1 that could cause an authenticated remote user being able to inject arbitrary XML code and obtain disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, server side request forgery due to improper configuration of the XML parser.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:schneider-electric:webreports:1.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:schneider-electric:webreports:1.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:schneider-electric:webreports:3.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:schneider-electric:webreports:3.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:schneider-electric:webreports:1.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:schneider-electric:webreports:3.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
