An overflow in a global variable (sBuffer) leads to a Write-What-Where outcome. Writing beyond sBuffer will clobber most global variables until reaching a pointer such as DES_info or image_info. By controlling that pointer, one achieves an arbitrary write when its fields are assigned. The data written is from a potentially untrusted NITF file in the form of an integer. The attacker can gain control of the instruction pointer.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:airforce:nitf_extract_utility:7.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:airforce:nitf_extract_utility:7.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:airforce:nitf_extract_utility:7.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
