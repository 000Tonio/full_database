If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2020-12-15T21:30:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-12025","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-12-15T21:30:00","references":["https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-191-02"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/advisories/icsa-20-191-02"]},"summary":"Rockwell Automation Logix Designer Studio 5000 Versions 32.00, 32.01, and 32.02 vulnerable to an xml external entity (XXE) vulnerability, which may allow an attacker to view hostnames or other resources from the program.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:rockwellautomation:studio_5000_logix_designer:32.00:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:rockwellautomation:studio_5000_logix_designer:32.00:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:rockwellautomation:studio_5000_logix_designer:32.01:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:rockwellautomation:studio_5000_logix_designer:32.01:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:rockwellautomation:studio_5000_logix_designer:32.02:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:rockwellautomation:studio_5000_logix_designer:32.02:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:rockwellautomation:studio_5000_logix_designer:32.00:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rockwellautomation:studio_5000_logix_designer:32.01:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:rockwellautomation:studio_5000_logix_designer:32.02:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
