The vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling when DHCP version 4 (DHCPv4) messages are parsed. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious DHCPv4 message to or through a WAN interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a reload of the affected device. Note: On Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Routers, all of the following are considered WAN interfaces: 10 Gbps Ethernet interfaces 100 Gbps Ethernet interfaces Port channel interfaces that include multiple 10 and/or 100 Gbps Ethernet interfaces","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.7\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.7\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:cisco:cbr-8:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:cisco:cbr-8:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:cisco:ios_xe:16.7\\(1\\):*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
