This is because the pybind11 glue code assumes that the argument is a tensor. However, there is nothing stopping users from passing in a Python object instead of a tensor. The uninitialized memory address is due to a `reinterpret_cast` Since the `PyObject` is a Python object, not a TensorFlow Tensor, the cast to `EagerTensor` fails. The issue is patched in commit 22e07fb204386768e5bcbea563641ea11f96ceb8 and is released in TensorFlow versions 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.2.0:*:*:*:-:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.2.0:*:*:*:-:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.3.0:*:*:*:-:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.3.0:*:*:*:-:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.2.0:*:*:*:-:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.3.0:*:*:*:-:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:leap:15.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
