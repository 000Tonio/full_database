The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":4.4,"cvss-time":"2020-11-19T15:55:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2020-6014","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-11-19T15:55:00","references":["https://supportcontent.checkpoint.com/solutions?id=sk168081"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://supportcontent.checkpoint.com/solutions?id=sk168081"]},"summary":"Check Point Endpoint Security Client for Windows, with Anti-Bot or Threat Emulation blades installed, before version E83.20, tries to load a non-existent DLL during a query for the Domain Name.
