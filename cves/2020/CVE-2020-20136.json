Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2020-12-15T14:22:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-20136","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-12-15T14:22:00","references":["https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/issues/3537"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/QuantConnect/Lean/issues/3537"]},"summary":"QuantConnect Lean versions from 2.3.0.0 to 2.4.0.1 are affected by an insecure deserialization vulnerability due to insecure configuration of TypeNameHandling property in Json.NET library.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:quantconnect:lean:2.3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:quantconnect:lean:2.3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:quantconnect:lean:2.4.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:quantconnect:lean:2.4.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:quantconnect:lean:2.3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:quantconnect:lean:2.4.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
