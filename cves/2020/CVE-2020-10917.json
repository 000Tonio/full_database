Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2020-07-28T17:01:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-10917","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-07-28T17:01:00","references":["https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-20-684/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-20-684/"]},"summary":"This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NEC ESMPRO Manager 6.42. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the RMI service. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in deserialization of untrusted data. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM.
