If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5.8,"cvss-time":"2020-06-26T18:26:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-14204","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-06-26T18:26:00","references":["https://www.hooperlabs.xyz/disclosures/webfocus.php"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.hooperlabs.xyz/disclosures/webfocus.php"]},"summary":"In WebFOCUS Business Intelligence 8.0 (SP6), the administration portal allows remote attackers to read arbitrary local files or forge server-side HTTP requests via a crafted HTTP request to /ibi_apps/WFServlet.cfg because XML external entity injection is possible.
