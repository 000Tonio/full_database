A specially crafted document can cause the document parser to sign-extend a length used to terminate a loop, which can later result in the loop’s index being used to write outside the bounds of a heap buffer during the reading of file data. An attacker can entice the victim to open a document to trigger this vulnerability.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:softmaker:softmaker_office:2021:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:softmaker:softmaker_office:2021:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:softmaker:softmaker_office:2021:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
