An attacker can cause a change to the stack pointer used by the Secure World from a non-secure application if the stack is not initialized. This vulnerability affects only the software that is based on Armv8-M processors with the Security Extension.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:arm:armv8-m_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:arm:armv8-m_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:arm:armv8-m:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:arm:armv8-m:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:arm:armv8-m_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
