If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5.5,"cvss-time":"2021-05-07T01:22:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-7037","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-05-07T01:22:00","references":["https://support.avaya.com/css/P8/documents/101075574"],"summary":"An XML External Entities (XXE) vulnerability in Media Server component of Avaya Equinox Conferencing could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain read access to information that is stored on an affected system or even potentially lead to a denial of service.
