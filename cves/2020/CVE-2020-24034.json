Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":9,"cvss-time":"2020-09-11T14:36:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-24034","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2020-09-11T14:36:00","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/159026/Sagemcom-F-ST-5280-Privilege-Escalation.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Sep/3","https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Sep/3","https://support.sagemcom.com/fr/haut-debit"],"refmap":{"fulldisc":["20200901 Sagemcom router insecure deserialization > privilege escalation"],"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/159026/Sagemcom-F-ST-5280-Privilege-Escalation.html","https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2020/Sep/3","https://support.sagemcom.com/fr/haut-debit"]},"summary":"Sagemcom F@ST 5280 routers using firmware version 1.150.61 have insecure deserialization that allows any authenticated user to perform a privilege escalation to any other user. By making a request with valid sess_id, nonce, and ha1 values inside of the serialized session cookie, an attacker may alter the user value inside of this cookie, and assume the role and permissions of the user specified. By assuming the role of the user internal, which is inaccessible to end users by default, the attacker gains the permissions of the internal account, which includes the ability to flash custom firmware to the router, allowing the attacker to achieve a complete compromise.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:sagemcom:f\\@st_5280_router_firmware:1.150.61:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:sagemcom:f\\@st_5280_router_firmware:1.150.61:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:sagemcom:f\\@st_5280_router:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:sagemcom:f\\@st_5280_router:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:sagemcom:f\\@st_5280_router_firmware:1.150.61:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
