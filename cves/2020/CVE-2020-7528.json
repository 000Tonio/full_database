Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2020-09-21T19:39:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-7528","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-09-21T19:39:00","references":["https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/SEVD-2020-252-01/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/SEVD-2020-252-01/"]},"summary":"A CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability exists in SCADAPack 7x Remote Connect (V3.6.3.574 and prior) which could allow arbitrary code execution when an attacker builds a custom .PRJ file containing a malicious serialized buffer.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:schneider-electric:scadapack_7x_remote_connect:3.6.3.574:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:schneider-electric:scadapack_7x_remote_connect:3.6.3.574:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:schneider-electric:scadapack_7x_remote_connect:3.6.3.574:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
