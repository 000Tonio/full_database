Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2021-11-30T18:50:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-14933","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-11-30T18:50:00","references":["https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/06/20/1"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/06/20/1"]},"summary":"** DISPUTED ** compose.php in SquirrelMail 1.4.22 calls unserialize for the $attachments value, which originates from an HTTP POST request.
