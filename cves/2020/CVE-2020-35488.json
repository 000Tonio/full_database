Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2022-04-29T12:45:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-35488","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-04-29T12:45:00","references":["https://github.com/GuillaumePetit84/CVE-2020-35488","https://gitlab.com/nxlog-public/nxlog-ce/-/blob/master/ChangeLog.txt#L2"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/GuillaumePetit84/CVE-2020-35488"]},"summary":"The fileop module of the NXLog service in NXLog Community Edition 2.10.2150 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted Syslog payload to the Syslog service.
