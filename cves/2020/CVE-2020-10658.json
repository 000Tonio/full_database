Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2021-01-08T20:32:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2020-10658","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-01-08T20:32:00","references":["https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog","https://www.proofpoint.com/us/security/security-advisories/pfpt-sa-2020-0003"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://www.proofpoint.com/us/security/security-advisories/pfpt-sa-2020-0003"],"misc":["https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog"]},"summary":"The Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Server (formerly ObserveIT Server) before 7.9.1 contains a vulnerability in the ITM application server's WriteImage API.
