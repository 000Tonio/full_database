If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":3.6,"cvss-time":"2021-01-12T14:07:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-4606","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-01-12T14:07:00","references":["https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/184883","https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6398602"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6398602"],"xf":["ibm-sss-cve20204606-xxe (184883)"]},"summary":"IBM Security Verify Privilege Manager 10.8 is vulnerable to an XML External Entity Injection (XXE) attack when processing XML data.
