If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2020-09-03T14:31:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2020-24656","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-09-03T14:31:00","references":["https://www.hackersforchange.com/post/maltego-cve-2020-24656-analysis","https://www.maltego.com/changelog/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://www.hackersforchange.com/post/maltego-cve-2020-24656-analysis","https://www.maltego.com/changelog/"]},"summary":"Maltego before 4.2.12 allows XXE attacks.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:maltego:maltego:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:maltego:maltego:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:maltego:maltego:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
