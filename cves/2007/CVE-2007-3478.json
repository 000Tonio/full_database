A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2018-10-16T16:50:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2007-3478","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2018-10-16T16:50:00","references":["http://bugs.libgd.org/?do=details&task_id=48","http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=40578","http://fedoranews.org/updates/FEDORA-2007-205.shtml","http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2011-January/052848.html","http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2011-January/052854.html","http://osvdb.org/37740","http://secunia.com/advisories/25855","http://secunia.com/advisories/26272","http://secunia.com/advisories/26390","http://secunia.com/advisories/26415","http://secunia.com/advisories/26467","http://secunia.com/advisories/26663","http://secunia.com/advisories/26766","http://secunia.com/advisories/26856","http://secunia.com/advisories/30168","http://secunia.com/advisories/42813","http://security.gentoo.org/glsa/glsa-200708-05.xml","http://security.gentoo.org/glsa/glsa-200711-34.xml","http://security.gentoo.org/glsa/glsa-200805-13.xml","http://www.libgd.org/ReleaseNote020035","http://www.mandriva.com/security/advisories?name=MDKSA-2007:153","http://www.mandriva.com/security/advisories?name=MDKSA-2007:164","http://www.novell.com/linux/security/advisories/2007_15_sr.html","http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-package-announce/2007-September/msg00311.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/478796/100/0/threaded","http://www.trustix.org/errata/2007/0024/","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/2336","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2011/0022","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=277421","https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1643"],"refmap":{"bugtraq":["20070907 FLEA-2007-0052-1 gd"],"confirm":["http://bugs.libgd.org/?do=details&task_id=48","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=277421","https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1643"],"fedora":["FEDORA-2007-2055","FEDORA-2007-692","FEDORA-2010-19022","FEDORA-2010-19033"],"gentoo":["GLSA-200708-05","GLSA-200711-34","GLSA-200805-13"],"mandriva":["MDKSA-2007:153","MDKSA-2007:164"],"misc":["http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=40578","http://www.libgd.org/ReleaseNote020035"],"osvdb":["37740"],"secunia":["25855","26272","26390","26415","26467","26663","26766","26856","30168","42813"],"suse":["SUSE-SR:2007:015"],"trustix":["2007-0024"],"vupen":["ADV-2007-2336","ADV-2011-0022"]},"statements":[{"contributor":"Mark J Cox","lastmodified":"2008-02-14","organization":"Red Hat","statement":"We currently do not plan to backport a fix for this issue to gd packages in current versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 2.1, 3, 4, and 5 due to the low likelihood of and application affected by this problem being exposed in a way that would allow trust boundary to be crossed."}],"summary":"Race condition in gdImageStringFTEx (gdft_draw_bitmap) in gdft.c in the GD Graphics Library (libgd) before 2.0.35 allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via unspecified vectors, possibly involving truetype font (TTF) support.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:gd_graphics_library:gdlib:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:gd_graphics_library:gdlib:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:gd_graphics_library:gdlib:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
