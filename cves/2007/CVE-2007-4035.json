NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of these issues, because physical collection can be used instead, because the vendor believes that relevant attackers typically do not corrupt an MBR or a filesystem, and because detection of a loop is valuable on its own.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:guidance_software:encase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:guidance_software:encase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:guidance_software:encase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
