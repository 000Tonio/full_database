A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":9.3,"cvss-time":"2018-10-16T16:31:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2007-0099","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2018-10-16T16:31:00","msbulletin":[{"bulletin_id":"MS08-069","bulletin_url":null,"date":"2008-11-11T00:00:00","impact":"Remote Code Execution","knowledgebase_id":"955218","knowledgebase_url":null,"severity":"Critical","title":"Vulnerabilities in Microsoft XML Core Services Could Allow Remote Code Execution"}],"oval":[{"accepted":"2008-12-29T04:00:25.122-05:00","class":"vulnerability","contributors":[{"name":"Sudhir Gandhe","organization":"Secure Elements, Inc."}],"definition_extensions":[{"comment":"Microsoft XML Core Services 3 is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:415"}],"description":"Race condition in the msxml3 module in Microsoft XML Core Services 3.0, as used in Internet Explorer 6 and other applications, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash) via many nested tags in an XML document in an IFRAME, when synchronous document rendering is frequently disrupted with asynchronous events, as demonstrated using a JavaScript timer, which can trigger NULL pointer dereferences or memory corruption, aka \"MSXML Memory Corruption Vulnerability.\"","family":"windows","id":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:5793","status":"accepted","submitted":"2008-11-19T14:19:00","title":"MSXML Memory Corruption Vulnerability","version":"72"}],"references":["http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2007-01/0113.html","http://isc.sans.org/diary.php?storyid=2004","http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=122703006921213&w=2","http://osvdb.org/32627","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Jan/0110.html","http://secunia.com/advisories/23655","http://securitytracker.com/id?1021164","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/455965/100/0/threaded","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/455986/100/0/threaded","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/456343/100/0/threaded","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/21872","http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/techalerts/TA08-316A.html","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2008/3111","https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2008/ms08-069","https://oval.cisecurity.org/repository/search/definition/oval%3Aorg.mitre.oval%3Adef%3A5793"],"refmap":{"bid":["21872"],"bugtraq":["20070104 Concurrency strikes MSIE (potentially exploitable msxml3 flaws)","20070104 RE: [Full-disclosure] Concurrency strikes MSIE (potentially exploitablemsxml3 flaws)","20070104 Re: RE: [Full-disclosure] Concurrency strikes MSIE (potentially exploitablemsxml3 flaws)"],"cert":["TA08-316A"],"fulldisc":["20070104 Concurrency strikes MSIE (potentially exploitable msxml3 flaws)","20070104 Re: Concurrency strikes MSIE (potentially exploitablemsxml3 flaws)"],"hp":["HPSBST02386","SSRT080164"],"misc":["http://isc.sans.org/diary.php?storyid=2004"],"osvdb":["32627"],"sectrack":["1021164"],"secunia":["23655"],"vupen":["ADV-2008-3111"]},"summary":"Race condition in the msxml3 module in Microsoft XML Core Services 3.0, as used in Internet Explorer 6 and other applications, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash) via many nested tags in an XML document in an IFRAME, when synchronous document rendering is frequently disrupted with asynchronous events, as demonstrated using a JavaScript timer, which can trigger NULL pointer dereferences or memory corruption, aka \"MSXML Memory Corruption Vulnerability.\"","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:xml_core_services:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:xml_core_services:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:xml_core_services:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
