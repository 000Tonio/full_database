According to the vendor, this issue is separate from the \"sign-on issues\" that reduced Skype service on 20070817, which appears to be a site-specific problem.  As of 20070821, it is not clear whether this issue is simply a symptom of the larger sign-on problem.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:skype_technologies:skype:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:skype_technologies:skype:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:skype_technologies:skype:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
