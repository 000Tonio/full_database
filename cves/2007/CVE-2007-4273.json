Most applications assume that users will provide static text and may respond unpredictably to the presence of formatting character. For example, in certain functions of the C programming languages such as printf, the formatting character %s will print the contents of a memory location expecting this location to identify a string and the formatting character %n prints the number of DWORD written in the memory. An adversary can use this to read or write to memory locations or files, or simply to manipulate the value of the resulting text in unexpected ways. Reading or writing memory may result in program crashes and writing memory could result in the execution of arbitrary code if the adversary can write to the program stack."}],"cvss":4.6,"cvss-time":"2017-07-29T01:32:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-134","id":"CVE-2007-4273","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2017-07-29T01:32:00","references":["http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=581","http://secunia.com/advisories/26471","http://securitytracker.com/id?1018581","http://www.attrition.org/pipermail/vim/2007-August/001765.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/25339","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/2912","http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IY98011","http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IY98101","http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21255352","http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21255607","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/36106"],"refmap":{"aixapar":["IY98011","IY98101"],"bid":["25339"],"confirm":["http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21255352","http://www-1.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21255607"],"idefense":["20070816 IBM DB2 Universal Database Directory Creation Vulnerability"],"sectrack":["1018581"],"secunia":["26471"],"vim":["20070818 Recent DB2 Vulnerabilities"],"vupen":["ADV-2007-2912"],"xf":["db2-message-file-format-string(36106)"]},"summary":"IBM DB2 UDB 8 before Fixpak 15 and 9.1 before Fixpak 3 allows local users to create arbitrary directories and execute arbitrary code via a \"crafted localized message file\" that enables a format string attack, possibly involving the (1) OSSEMEMDBG or (2) TRC_LOG_FILE environment variable in db2licd (db2licm).","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:db2_universal_database:*:fp14:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:db2_universal_database:*:fp14:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:db2_universal_database:*:*:fp2:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:db2_universal_database:*:*:fp2:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:ibm:db2_universal_database:*:fp14:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ibm:db2_universal_database:*:*:fp2:*:*:*:*:*"]}
