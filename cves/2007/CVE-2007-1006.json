Most applications assume that users will provide static text and may respond unpredictably to the presence of formatting character. For example, in certain functions of the C programming languages such as printf, the formatting character %s will print the contents of a memory location expecting this location to identify a string and the formatting character %n prints the number of DWORD written in the memory. An adversary can use this to read or write to memory locations or files, or simply to manipulate the value of the resulting text in unexpected ways. Reading or writing memory may result in program crashes and writing memory could result in the execution of arbitrary code if the adversary can write to the program stack."}],"cvss":10,"cvss-time":"2017-10-11T01:31:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-134","id":"CVE-2007-1006","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2017-10-11T01:31:00","oval":[{"accepted":"2013-04-29T04:15:09.141-04:00","class":"vulnerability","contributors":[{"name":"Aharon Chernin","organization":"SCAP.com, LLC"},{"name":"Dragos Prisaca","organization":"G2, Inc."}],"definition_extensions":[{"comment":"The operating system installed on the system is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:11414"},{"comment":"The operating system installed on the system is CentOS Linux 5.x","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:15802"},{"comment":"Oracle Linux 5.x","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:15459"}],"description":"Multiple format string vulnerabilities in the gm_main_window_flash_message function in Ekiga before 2.0.5 allow attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted Q.931 SETUP packet.","family":"unix","id":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:11642","status":"accepted","submitted":"2010-07-09T03:56:16-04:00","title":"Multiple format string vulnerabilities in the gm_main_window_flash_message function in Ekiga before 2.0.5 allow attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted Q.931 SETUP packet.","version":"19"}],"redhat":{"advisories":[{"bugzilla":{"id":"1618289","title":"CVE-2007-0999 security flaw"},"oval":{"OR":[{"comment":"Red Hat Enterprise Linux must be installed","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhba:tst:20070304026"},{"AND":[{"comment":"Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is installed","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhba:tst:20070331005"},{"comment":"ekiga is earlier than 0:2.0.2-7.0.2","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20070087001"},{"comment":"ekiga is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20070087002"}]}]},"rhsa":{"id":"RHSA-2007:0087","released":"2007-03-14","severity":"Critical","title":"RHSA-2007:0087: ekiga security update (Critical)"}}],"rpms":["ekiga-0:2.0.2-7.0.2","ekiga-debuginfo-0:2.0.2-7.0.2"]},"references":["http://fedoranews.org/cms/node/2682","http://fedoranews.org/cms/node/2683","http://labs.musecurity.com/advisories/MU-200702-01.txt","http://mail.gnome.org/archives/ekiga-list/2007-February/msg00060.html","http://secunia.com/advisories/24194","http://secunia.com/advisories/24228","http://secunia.com/advisories/24229","http://secunia.com/advisories/24271","http://secunia.com/advisories/24379","http://secunia.com/advisories/24680","http://secunia.com/advisories/25119","http://security.gentoo.org/glsa/glsa-200703-25.xml","http://www.debian.org/security/2007/dsa-1262","http://www.ekiga.org/index.php?rub=10&archive=1","http://www.mandriva.com/security/advisories?name=MDKSA-2007:044","http://www.novell.com/linux/security/advisories/2007_9_sr.html","http://www.osvdb.org/31939","http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2007-0087.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/22613","http://www.securitytracker.com/id?1017673","http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-426-1","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/0655","https://oval.cisecurity.org/repository/search/definition/oval%3Aorg.mitre.oval%3Adef%3A11642"],"refmap":{"bid":["22613"],"confirm":["http://www.ekiga.org/index.php?rub=10&archive=1"],"debian":["DSA-1262"],"fedora":["FEDORA-2007-262","FEDORA-2007-263"],"gentoo":["GLSA-200703-25"],"mandriva":["MDKSA-2007:044"],"misc":["http://labs.musecurity.com/advisories/MU-200702-01.txt"],"mlist":["[Ekiga-list] 20070213 Ekiga 2.0.5 available"],"osvdb":["31939"],"sectrack":["1017673"],"secunia":["24194","24228","24229","24271","24379","24680","25119"],"suse":["SUSE-SR:2007:009"],"ubuntu":["USN-426-1"],"vupen":["ADV-2007-0655"]},"summary":"Multiple format string vulnerabilities in the gm_main_window_flash_message function in Ekiga before 2.0.5 allow attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted Q.931 SETUP packet.
