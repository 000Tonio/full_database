Most applications assume that users will provide static text and may respond unpredictably to the presence of formatting character. For example, in certain functions of the C programming languages such as printf, the formatting character %s will print the contents of a memory location expecting this location to identify a string and the formatting character %n prints the number of DWORD written in the memory. An adversary can use this to read or write to memory locations or files, or simply to manipulate the value of the resulting text in unexpected ways. Reading or writing memory may result in program crashes and writing memory could result in the execution of arbitrary code if the adversary can write to the program stack."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2018-10-15T21:41:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-134","id":"CVE-2007-5265","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-10-15T21:41:00","references":["http://aluigi.altervista.org/adv/dawnfs-adv.txt","http://forums.dawnoftime.org/viewtopic.php?t=2102","http://secunia.com/advisories/27083","http://securityreason.com/securityalert/3201","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/481619/100/0/threaded","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/25944","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/3418","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/36973"],"refmap":{"bid":["25944"],"bugtraq":["20071005 Format string in The Dawn of Time 1.69s beta4"],"misc":["http://aluigi.altervista.org/adv/dawnfs-adv.txt","http://forums.dawnoftime.org/viewtopic.php?t=2102"],"secunia":["27083"],"sreason":["3201"],"vupen":["ADV-2007-3418"],"xf":["dawntime-httpauthentication-format-string(36973)"]},"summary":"Multiple format string vulnerabilities in websrv.cpp in Dawn of Time 1.69s beta4 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) username or (2) password fields when accessing certain \"restricted zones\", which are not properly handled by the (a) processWebHeader and (b) filterWebRequest functions.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:dawnoftime:dawn_of_time:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:dawnoftime:dawn_of_time:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:dawnoftime:dawn_of_time:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
