NOTE: there has been debate about whether the issue is in Internet Explorer or Netscape. As of 20070713, it is CVE's opinion that IE appears to not properly delimit the URL argument when invoking Netscape; this issue could arise with other protocol handlers in IE.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:netscape:navigator:9.0:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:netscape:navigator:9.0:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netscape:navigator:9.0:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
