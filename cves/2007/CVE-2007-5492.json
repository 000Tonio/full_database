Implementation: Perform testing such as pen-testing and vulnerability scanning to identify directories, programs, and interfaces that grant direct access to executables. Implementation: Implement host integrity monitoring to detect any unwanted altering of configuration files. Implementation: Ensure that files that are not required to execute, such as configuration files, are not over-privileged, i.e. not allowed to execute.","summary":"An attack of this type exploits a system's trust in configuration and resource files. When the executable loads the resource (such as an image file or configuration file) the attacker has modified the file to either execute malicious code directly or manipulate the target process (e.g. application server) to execute based on the malicious configuration parameters. Since systems are increasingly interrelated mashing up resources from local and remote sources the possibility of this attack occurring is high."},{"id":"77","name":"Manipulating User-Controlled Variables","prerequisites":"A variable consumed by the application server is exposed to the client.

This means that a malicious user may be able to set variables unexpectedly. For instance make sure that the server setting for PHP does not expose global variables. A software system should be reluctant to trust variables that have been initialized outside of its trust boundary. Ensure adequate checking is performed when relying on input from outside a trust boundary. Separate the presentation layer and the business logic layer. Variables at the business logic layer should not be exposed at the presentation layer. This is to prevent computation of business logic from user controlled input data. Use encapsulation when declaring your variables. This is to lower the exposure of your variables. Assume all input is malicious. Create a white list that defines all valid input to the software system based on the requirements specifications. Input that does not match against the white list should be rejected by the program.","summary":"This attack targets user controlled variables (DEBUG=1, PHP Globals, and So Forth). An attacker can override environment variables leveraging user-supplied, untrusted query variables directly used on the application server without any data sanitization. In extreme cases, the attacker can change variables controlling the business logic of the application. For instance, in languages like PHP, a number of poorly set default configurations may allow the user to override variables."}],"cvss":4.6,"cvss-time":"2018-10-15T21:45:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:H/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-94","id":"CVE-2007-5492","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-10-15T21:45:00","references":["http://osvdb.org/43760","http://secunia.com/advisories/27503","http://secunia.com/advisories/28008","http://teamforge.net/viewcvs/viewcvs.cgi/tags/release-3.3.9/doc/history.txt?view=markup","http://www.debian.org/security/2007/dsa-1423","http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-200711-05.xml","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/482499/100/0/threaded","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/26126","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/3768","https://bugs.gentoo.org/attachment.cgi?id=133465&action=view","https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=195810"],"refmap":{"bid":["26126"],"bugtraq":["20071018 Serious holes affecting SiteBar 3.3.8"],"confirm":["http://teamforge.net/viewcvs/viewcvs.cgi/tags/release-3.3.9/doc/history.txt?view=markup","https://bugs.gentoo.org/attachment.cgi?id=133465&action=view","https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=195810"],"debian":["DSA-1423"],"gentoo":["GLSA-200711-05"],"osvdb":["43760"],"secunia":["27503","28008"],"vupen":["ADV-2007-3768"]},"summary":"Static code injection vulnerability in the translation module (translator.php) in SiteBar 3.3.8 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary PHP code via the value parameter.
