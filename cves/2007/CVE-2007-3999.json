An attacker who has access to an API may try to embed malicious code in the API function call and exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in the function's implementation.

This has a very broad effect on security across a system, usually affecting more than one software process."},{"id":"10","name":"Buffer Overflow via Environment Variables","prerequisites":"The application uses environment variables.

Before starting the development of the application, consider using a code language (e.g., Java) or compiler that limits the ability of developers to act beyond the bounds of a buffer. If the chosen language is susceptible to buffer related issues (e.g., C) then consider using secure functions instead of those vulnerable to buffer manipulations. If a potentially dangerous function must be used, make sure that proper boundary checking is performed. Additionally, there are often a number of compiler-based mechanisms (e.g., StackGuard, ProPolice and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag) that can help identify and protect against potential buffer issues. Finally, there may be operating system level preventative functionality that can be applied.","summary":"An adversary manipulates an application's interaction with a buffer in an attempt to read or modify data they shouldn't have access to. Buffer attacks are distinguished in that it is the buffer space itself that is the target of the attack rather than any code responsible for interpreting the content of the buffer. In virtually all buffer attacks the content that is placed in the buffer is immaterial. Instead, most buffer attacks involve retrieving or providing more input than can be stored in the allocated buffer, resulting in the reading or overwriting of other unintended program memory."},{"id":"24","name":"Filter Failure through Buffer Overflow","prerequisites":"Ability to control the length of data passed to an active filter.","related_weakness":["118","119","120","20","680","697","733","74"],"solutions":"Make sure that ANY failure occurring in the filtering or input validation routine is properly handled and that offending input is NOT allowed to go through.

An attacker may try to feed overly long input strings to the program in an attempt to overwhelm the filter (by causing a buffer overflow) and hoping that the filter does not fail securely (i.e. the user input is let into the system unfiltered)."},{"id":"47","name":"Buffer Overflow via Parameter Expansion","prerequisites":"The program expands one of the parameters passed to a function with input controlled by the user, but a later function making use of the expanded parameter erroneously considers the original, not the expanded size of the parameter.

Binary resources may include music files like MP3, image files like JPEG files, and any other binary file. These attacks may pass unnoticed to the client machine through normal usage of files, such as a browser loading a seemingly innocent JPEG file. This can allow the attacker access to the execution stack and execute arbitrary code in the target process. This attack pattern is a variant of standard buffer overflow attacks using an unexpected vector (binary files) to wrap its attack and open up a new attack vector. The attacker is required to either directly serve the binary content to the victim, or place it in a locale like a MP3 sharing application, for the victim to download. The attacker then is notified upon the download or otherwise locates the vulnerability opened up by the buffer overflow."},{"id":"42","name":"MIME Conversion","prerequisites":"The target system uses a mail server.

message.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.4.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.4.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.4.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.4.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.5.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.5.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.4.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.4.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.5.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:mit:kerberos_5:1.6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
