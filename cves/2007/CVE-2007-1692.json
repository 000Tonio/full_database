NOTE: it could be argued that if an attacker already has control over WINS/DNS, then web traffic could already be intercepted by modifying WINS or DNS records, so this would not cross privilege boundaries and would not be a vulnerability.  It has also been reported that DHCP is an alternate attack vector.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_2000:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_2000:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_2003_server:2000:*:small_business_server:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_2003_server:2000:*:small_business_server:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_2003_server:r2:*:datacenter_64-bit:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_2003_server:r2:*:datacenter_64-bit:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_2000:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_2003_server:2000:*:small_business_server:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_2003_server:r2:*:datacenter_64-bit:*:*:*:*:*"]}
