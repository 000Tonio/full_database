NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of these vectors because the user can select fewer options, there is no operational impact, or the user can do less expansion.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:guidance_software:encase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:guidance_software:encase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:guidance_software:encase:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
