If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2021-10-20T11:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2014-3004","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-10-20T11:15:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/67676","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/126854/Castor-Library-XXE-Disclosure.html","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/May/142","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-updates/2014-06/msg00043.html","http://secunia.com/advisories/59427","https://quickview.cloudapps.cisco.com/quickview/bug/CSCvm56811","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html"],"refmap":{"bid":["67676"],"fulldisc":["20140527 CVE-2014-3004 - Castor Library Default Config could lead to XML External Entity (XXE) Attacks"],"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/126854/Castor-Library-XXE-Disclosure.html","https://quickview.cloudapps.cisco.com/quickview/bug/CSCvm56811","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2020.html"],"secunia":["59427"],"suse":["openSUSE-SU-2014:0822"]},"summary":"The default configuration for the Xerces SAX Parser in Castor before 1.3.3 allows context-dependent attackers to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks via a crafted XML document.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:castor_project:castor:1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:castor_project:castor:1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:castor_project:castor:1.3.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:castor_project:castor:1.3.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:castor_project:castor:1.3.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:castor_project:castor:1.3.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:opensuse_project:opensuse:12.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:opensuse_project:opensuse:12.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:opensuse:13.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:opensuse:13.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:castor_project:castor:1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:castor_project:castor:1.3.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:castor_project:castor:1.3.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:opensuse_project:opensuse:12.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:opensuse:opensuse:13.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
