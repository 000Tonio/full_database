The target host does not do proper range checking on the variable before utilizing it. When the integer variable is incremented or decremented to an out of range value, it gets a very different value (e.g. very small or negative number)","related_weakness":["120","122","128","190","196","680","697"],"solutions":"Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking. Carefully review the service's implementation before making it available to user. For instance you can use manual or automated code review to uncover vulnerabilities such as integer overflow. Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution. Always do bound checking before consuming user input data.","summary":"This attack forces an integer variable to go out of range. The integer variable is often used as an offset such as size of memory allocation or similarly. The attacker would typically control the value of such variable and try to get it out of range. For instance the integer in question is incremented past the maximum possible value, it may wrap to become a very small, or negative number, therefore providing a very incorrect value which can lead to unexpected behavior. At worst the attacker can execute arbitrary code."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2020-02-14T15:26:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-190","id":"CVE-2014-4607","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-02-14T15:26:00","redhat":{"advisories":[{"bugzilla":{"id":"1112418","title":"CVE-2014-4607 lzo: lzo1x_decompress_safe() integer overflow"},"oval":{"OR":[{"comment":"Red Hat Enterprise Linux must be installed","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhba:tst:20070304026"},{"AND":[{"comment":"Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is installed","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhba:tst:20111656003"},{"OR":[{"AND":[{"comment":"lzo is earlier than 0:2.03-3.1.el6_5.1","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20140861001"},{"comment":"lzo is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease2 key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20140861002"}]},{"AND":[{"comment":"lzo-devel is earlier than 0:2.03-3.1.el6_5.1","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20140861003"},{"comment":"lzo-devel is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease2 key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20140861004"}]},{"AND":[{"comment":"lzo-minilzo is earlier than 0:2.03-3.1.el6_5.1","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20140861005"},{"comment":"lzo-minilzo is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease2 key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20140861006"}]}]}]},{"AND":[{"comment":"Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 is installed","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhba:tst:20150364027"},{"OR":[{"AND":[{"comment":"lzo is earlier than 0:2.06-6.el7_0.2","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20140861008"},{"comment":"lzo is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease2 key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20140861002"}]},{"AND":[{"comment":"lzo-devel is earlier than 0:2.06-6.el7_0.2","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20140861009"},{"comment":"lzo-devel is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease2 key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20140861004"}]},{"AND":[{"comment":"lzo-minilzo is earlier than 0:2.06-6.el7_0.2","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20140861010"},{"comment":"lzo-minilzo is signed with Red Hat redhatrelease2 key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20140861006"}]}]}]}]},"rhsa":{"id":"RHSA-2014:0861","released":"2014-07-09","severity":"Moderate","title":"RHSA-2014:0861: lzo security update (Moderate)"}}],"rpms":["lzo-0:2.03-3.1.el6_5.1","lzo-0:2.06-6.el7_0.2","lzo-debuginfo-0:2.03-3.1.el6_5.1","lzo-debuginfo-0:2.06-6.el7_0.2","lzo-devel-0:2.03-3.1.el6_5.1","lzo-devel-0:2.06-6.el7_0.2","lzo-minilzo-0:2.03-3.1.el6_5.1","lzo-minilzo-0:2.06-6.el7_0.2"]},"references":["http://blog.securitymouse.com/2014/06/raising-lazarus-20-year-old-bug-that.html","https://web.archive.org/web/20140701023922/http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://web.archive.org/web/20140701023922/http://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/"],"misc":["http://blog.securitymouse.com/2014/06/raising-lazarus-20-year-old-bug-that.html"]},"summary":"Integer overflow in the LZO algorithm variant in Oberhumer liblzo2 and lzo-2 before 2.07 on 32-bit platforms might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted Literal Run.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:oberhumer:liblzo2:*:*:*:*:*:*:x86:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:oberhumer:liblzo2:*:*:*:*:*:*:x86:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:oberhumer:lzo2:*:*:*:*:*:*:x86:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:oberhumer:lzo2:*:*:*:*:*:*:x86:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:oberhumer:liblzo2:*:*:*:*:*:*:x86:*","cpe:2.3:a:oberhumer:lzo2:*:*:*:*:*:*:x86:*"]}
