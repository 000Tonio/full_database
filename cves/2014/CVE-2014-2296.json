If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2018-09-19T13:31:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2014-2296","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-09-19T13:31:00","references":["http://jasig.275507.n4.nabble.com/CAS-3-5-2-1-and-3-4-12-1-Security-Releases-td4662444.html","https://vigilance.fr/vulnerability/Jasig-CAS-Server-bypassing-authentication-via-Google-Accounts-Integration-14512"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://vigilance.fr/vulnerability/Jasig-CAS-Server-bypassing-authentication-via-Google-Accounts-Integration-14512"],"mlist":["[cas-dev] 20140401  CAS 3.5.2.1 and 3.4.12.1 Security Releases"]},"summary":"XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in java/org/jasig/cas/util/SamlUtils.java in Jasig CAS server before 3.4.12.1 and 3.5.x before 3.5.2.1, when Google Accounts Integration is enabled, allows remote unauthenticated users to bypass authentication via crafted XML data.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:apereo:cas_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:apereo:cas_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:apereo:cas_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
