Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2021-06-14T18:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2014-9515","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-06-14T18:15:00","references":["https://infocon.org/cons/SyScan/SyScan%202015%20Singapore/SyScan%202015%20Singapore%20presentations/SyScan15%20David%20Jorm%20-%20Finding%20and%20exploiting%20novel%20flaws%20in%20Java%20software.pdf","https://github.com/pentestingforfunandprofit/research/tree/master/dozer-rce","https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer/issues/217","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/107970","https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer/issues/410","https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer/pull/447/commits/ccd550696f3df8545319ffa9c6adafc8eca2334c","https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer/issues/786","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html"],"refmap":{"bid":["107970"],"confirm":["https://github.com/DozerMapper/dozer/issues/217"],"misc":["https://github.com/pentestingforfunandprofit/research/tree/master/dozer-rce","https://infocon.org/cons/SyScan/SyScan%202015%20Singapore/SyScan%202015%20Singapore%20presentations/SyScan15%20David%20Jorm%20-%20Finding%20and%20exploiting%20novel%20flaws%20in%20Java%20software.pdf"]},"summary":"Dozer improperly uses a reflection-based approach to type conversion, which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted serialized object.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:dozer_project:dozer:5.2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:dozer_project:dozer:5.2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:dozer_project:dozer:5.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:dozer_project:dozer:5.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:dozer_project:dozer:5.3.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:dozer_project:dozer:5.3.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:dozer_project:dozer:5.3.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:dozer_project:dozer:5.3.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:dozer_project:dozer:5.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:dozer_project:dozer:5.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:dozer_project:dozer:5.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:dozer_project:dozer:5.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:dozer_project:dozer:5.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:dozer_project:dozer:5.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:dozer_project:dozer:5.2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:dozer_project:dozer:5.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:dozer_project:dozer:5.3.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:dozer_project:dozer:5.3.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:dozer_project:dozer:5.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:dozer_project:dozer:5.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:dozer_project:dozer:5.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
