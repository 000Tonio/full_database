Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2019-12-19T14:35:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2014-3699","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-12-19T14:35:00","redhat":{"advisories":[{"rhsa":{"id":"Red Hat"}}]},"references":["https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2014-3699","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2014-3699","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3699"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2014-3699","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3699"]},"summary":"eDeploy has RCE via cPickle deserialization of untrusted data","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:redhat:edeploy:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:redhat:edeploy:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:redhat:jboss_enterprise_web_server:1.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:redhat:jboss_enterprise_web_server:1.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:redhat:edeploy:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:redhat:jboss_enterprise_web_server:1.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
