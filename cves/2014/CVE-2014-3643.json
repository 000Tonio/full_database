If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2022-07-25T18:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2014-3643","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-07-25T18:15:00","redhat":{"advisories":[{"rhsa":{"id":"Red Hat"}}]},"references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2014-3643","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2014-3643","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2022.html"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2014-3643"]},"summary":"jersey: XXE via parameter entities not disabled by the jersey SAX parser","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:jersey_project:jersey:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:jersey_project:jersey:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:jersey_project:jersey:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
