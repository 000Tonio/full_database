The default security setting must be to deny access and then grant access only to those resources intended by business logic.","summary":"In applications, particularly web applications, access to functionality is mitigated by an authorization framework. This framework maps Access Control Lists (ACLs) to elements of the application's functionality; particularly URL's for web apps. In the case that the administrator failed to specify an ACL for a particular element, an attacker may be able to access it with impunity. An attacker with the ability to access functionality not properly constrained by ACLs can obtain sensitive information and possibly compromise the entire application. Such an attacker can access resources that must be available only to users at a higher privilege level, can access management sections of the application, or can run queries for data that they otherwise not supposed to."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2020-02-12T18:37:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-434","d2sec":[{"name":"WordPress Creative Contact Form 0.9.7 File Upload","url":"http://www.d2sec.com/exploits/wordpress_creative_contact_form_0.9.7_file_upload.html"}],"id":"CVE-2014-8739","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2020-02-12T18:37:00","references":["http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/113669","http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/113673","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/11/11/4","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/11/11/5","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/11/13/3","https://wordpress.org/plugins/sexy-contact-form/changelog/","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/35057/","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/36811/"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/113669","http://osvdb.org/show/osvdb/113673","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/11/11/4","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/11/11/5","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2014/11/13/3","https://wordpress.org/plugins/sexy-contact-form/changelog/","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/35057/","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/36811/"]},"summary":"Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in server/php/UploadHandler.php in the jQuery File Upload Plugin 6.4.4 for jQuery, as used in the Creative Solutions Creative Contact Form (formerly Sexy Contact Form) before 1.0.0 for WordPress and before 2.0.1 for Joomla!, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by uploading a PHP file with an PHP extension, then accessing it via a direct request to the file in files/, as exploited in the wild in October 2014.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:-:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:-:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:0.9.1:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:0.9.1:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:0.9.2:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:0.9.2:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:0.9.3:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:0.9.3:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:0.9.4:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:0.9.4:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:0.9.6:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:0.9.6:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:0.9.7:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:0.9.7:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:-:*:*:*:*:joomla\\!:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:-:*:*:*:*:joomla\\!:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:jquery_file_upload_project:jquery_file_upload:6.4.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:jquery_file_upload_project:jquery_file_upload:6.4.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:-:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:0.9.1:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:0.9.2:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:0.9.3:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:0.9.4:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:0.9.6:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:0.9.7:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:creative-solutions:creative_contact_form:-:*:*:*:*:joomla\\!:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jquery_file_upload_project:jquery_file_upload:6.4.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
