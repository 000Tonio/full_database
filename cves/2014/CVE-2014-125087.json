If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2014-125087","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-02-19T17:15:00","references":["https://vuldb.com/?id.221480","https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.221480","https://github.com/jmurty/java-xmlbuilder/issues/6","https://github.com/jmurty/java-xmlbuilder/releases/tag/v1.2","https://github.com/jmurty/java-xmlbuilder/commit/e6fddca201790abab4f2c274341c0bb8835c3e73"],"summary":"A vulnerability was found in java-xmlbuilder up to 1.1.
