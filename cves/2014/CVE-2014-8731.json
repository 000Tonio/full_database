Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":10,"cvss-time":"2018-10-09T19:54:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2014-8731","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2018-10-09T19:54:00","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/129089/PHPMemcachedAdmin-1.2.2-Remote-Code-Execution.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/533968/100/0/threaded","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/533980/100/0/threaded","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/71059","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/98638"],"refmap":{"bid":["71059"],"bugtraq":["20141112 CVE-2014-8731 - RCE in phpMemcachedAdmin <=1.2.2","20141113 Re: CVE-2014-8731 - RCE in phpMemcachedAdmin <=1.2.2"],"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/129089/PHPMemcachedAdmin-1.2.2-Remote-Code-Execution.html"],"xf":["phpmemcachedadmin-cve20148731-code-exec(98638)"]},"summary":"PHPMemcachedAdmin 1.2.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via vectors related \"serialized data and the last part of the concatenated filename,\" which creates a file in webroot.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:phpmemcachedadmin_project:phpmemcachedadmin:1.2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:phpmemcachedadmin_project:phpmemcachedadmin:1.2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:phpmemcachedadmin_project:phpmemcachedadmin:1.2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
