Most applications assume that users will provide static text and may respond unpredictably to the presence of formatting character. For example, in certain functions of the C programming languages such as printf, the formatting character %s will print the contents of a memory location expecting this location to identify a string and the formatting character %n prints the number of DWORD written in the memory. An adversary can use this to read or write to memory locations or files, or simply to manipulate the value of the resulting text in unexpected ways. Reading or writing memory may result in program crashes and writing memory could result in the execution of arbitrary code if the adversary can write to the program stack."}],"cvss":9,"cvss-time":"2023-02-13T00:44:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-134","id":"CVE-2014-8170","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2023-02-13T00:44:00","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1194745","https://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-node.git%3Ba=blob%3Bf=src/ovirtnode/ovirtfunctions.py%3Bh=caef7ef019ca12b49aa3c030792538956fb4caad%3Bhb=e11e02cd9256c854dd0419515097637d6829b4f1#l1091"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1194745"],"misc":["https://gerrit.ovirt.org/gitweb?p=ovirt-node.git;a=blob;f=src/ovirtnode/ovirtfunctions.py;h=caef7ef019ca12b49aa3c030792538956fb4caad;hb=e11e02cd9256c854dd0419515097637d6829b4f1#l1091"]},"summary":"ovirt_safe_delete_config in ovirtfunctions.py and other unspecified locations in ovirt-node 3.0.0-474-gb852fd7 as packaged in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3 do not properly quote input strings, which allows remote authenticated users and physically proximate attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a ; (semicolon) in an input string.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ovirt:ovirt-node:3.0.0-474-gb852fd7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ovirt:ovirt-node:3.0.0-474-gb852fd7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:redhat:enterprise_virtualization:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:redhat:enterprise_virtualization:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:ovirt:ovirt-node:3.0.0-474-gb852fd7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
