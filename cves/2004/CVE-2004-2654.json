However, the vendor's bug report clearly shows that the researcher later retracted this claim, because the tested product was actually STABLE5.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:squid:squid:2.5_stable5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:squid:squid:2.5_stable5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:squid:squid:2.5_stable5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
