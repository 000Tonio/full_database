The DoS flaw affects slower machines and those with less ram quicker than higher specification machines. On very hi-spec machines, the flaw does not seem to be exploitable.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_2003_server:r2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_2003_server:r2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_xp:*:gold:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_xp:*:gold:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_xp:*:sp1:tablet_pc:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_xp:*:sp1:tablet_pc:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
