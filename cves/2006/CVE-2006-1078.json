However, if there are some typical or recommended configurations that use htpasswd with sudo privileges, or common products that access htpasswd remotely, then perhaps it should be included.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:acme_labs:thttpd:2.25b:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:acme_labs:thttpd:2.25b:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:acme_labs:thttpd:2.25b:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
