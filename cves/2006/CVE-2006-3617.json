NOTE: some vectors might overlap CVE-2006-2975, although the use of alternate manipulations makes it unclear.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:pixelated_by_lev:pixelated_by_lev_guestbook:1.32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:pixelated_by_lev:pixelated_by_lev_guestbook:1.32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:pixelated_by_lev:pixelated_by_lev_guestbook:1.32:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
