NOTE: in most cases, this attack would not cross privilege boundaries, because modifying the SuiteOwners key requires administrative privileges.  However, this issue is a vulnerability because the product's functionality is intended to protect against privileged actions such as this.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:symantec:norton_personal_firewall:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:symantec:norton_personal_firewall:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:symantec:norton_personal_firewall:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
