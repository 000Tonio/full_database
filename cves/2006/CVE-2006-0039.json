A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":4.7,"cvss-time":"2023-02-13T02:16:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:C","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2006-0039","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2023-02-13T02:16:00","oval":[{"accepted":"2013-04-29T04:04:29.554-04:00","class":"vulnerability","contributors":[{"name":"Aharon Chernin","organization":"SCAP.com, LLC"},{"name":"Dragos Prisaca","organization":"G2, Inc."}],"definition_extensions":[{"comment":"The operating system installed on the system is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:11831"},{"comment":"CentOS Linux 4.x","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:16636"},{"comment":"Oracle Linux 4.x","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:15990"}],"description":"Race condition in the do_add_counters function in netfilter for Linux kernel 2.6.16 allows local users with CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities to read kernel memory by triggering the race condition in a way that produces a size value that is inconsistent with allocated memory, which leads to a buffer over-read in IPT_ENTRY_ITERATE.","family":"unix","id":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:10309","status":"accepted","submitted":"2010-07-09T03:56:16-04:00","title":"Race condition in the do_add_counters function in netfilter for Linux kernel 2.6.16 allows local users with CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities to read kernel memory by triggering the race condition in a way that produces a size value that is inconsistent with allocated memory, which leads to a buffer over-read in IPT_ENTRY_ITERATE.","version":"29"}],"redhat":{"advisories":[{"rhsa":{"id":"RHSA-2006:0689"}}],"rpms":["kernel-0:2.6.9-42.0.3.EL","kernel-debuginfo-0:2.6.9-42.0.3.EL","kernel-devel-0:2.6.9-42.0.3.EL","kernel-doc-0:2.6.9-42.0.3.EL","kernel-hugemem-0:2.6.9-42.0.3.EL","kernel-hugemem-devel-0:2.6.9-42.0.3.EL","kernel-largesmp-0:2.6.9-42.0.3.EL","kernel-largesmp-devel-0:2.6.9-42.0.3.EL","kernel-smp-0:2.6.9-42.0.3.EL","kernel-smp-devel-0:2.6.9-42.0.3.EL"]},"references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=191698","http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133465","http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/ChangeLog-2.6.16.17","http://secunia.com/advisories/20185","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/18113","http://www.debian.org/security/2006/dsa-1097","http://secunia.com/advisories/20671","http://www.debian.org/security/2006/dsa-1103","http://secunia.com/advisories/20914","http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-311-1","http://secunia.com/advisories/20991","http://www.osvdb.org/25697","http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2006-0689.html","http://secunia.com/advisories/22292","http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/ASA-2006-249.htm","http://secunia.com/advisories/22945","http://secunia.com/advisories/21476","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2006/1893","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2006/2554","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/26583","https://oval.cisecurity.org/repository/search/definition/oval%3Aorg.mitre.oval%3Adef%3A10309","http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git%3Ba=commit%3Bh=2722971cbe831117686039d5c334f2c0f560be13"],"refmap":{"bid":["18113"],"confirm":["http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=133465","http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/ChangeLog-2.6.16.17","http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/ASA-2006-249.htm","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=191698"],"debian":["DSA-1097","DSA-1103"],"misc":["http://www.kernel.org/git/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=2722971cbe831117686039d5c334f2c0f560be13"],"osvdb":["25697"],"secunia":["20185","20671","20914","20991","21476","22292","22945"],"ubuntu":["USN-311-1"],"vupen":["ADV-2006-1893","ADV-2006-2554"],"xf":["linux-doaddcounters-race-condition(26583)"]},"summary":"Race condition in the do_add_counters function in netfilter for Linux kernel 2.6.16 allows local users with CAP_NET_ADMIN capabilities to read kernel memory by triggering the race condition in a way that produces a size value that is inconsistent with allocated memory, which leads to a buffer over-read in IPT_ENTRY_ITERATE.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:2.6.16:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:2.6.16:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:2.6.16:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
