In the AirMagnet Enterprise system, such a script can be executed from the Sensor webpage or the AirWISE page in the AirMagnet Enterprise Console. This attack will not cause any damage to the AirMagnet Enterprise Server and no data will be lost or stolen. The intruder could potentially impact the performance of the machine running the Enterprise Console software. This is a known vulnerability in Internet Explorer and only works if users have enabled DirectX to execute scripts inside of Internet Explorer. \n\n- AirMagnet Solution: Listing SSIDs within quotes (“ “) will fix the problem. Customers should also be encouraged to not allow DirectX scripts in IE.\n\n- Fix Availability: Patch currently available on MyAirMagnet. Customers should upgrade to the latest version available on MyAirMagnet. Customers running a version of AirMagnet older than 6.1 must upgrade to version 6.1 before upgrading to the current release. Customers can contact AirMagnet Support to obtain the 6.1 release. \n"}],"summary":"The AirMagnet Enterprise console and Remote Sensor console (Laptop) in AirMagnet Enterprise before 7.5 build 6307 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML from a certain embedded Internet Explorer object into an SSID template value, aka \"Cross-Application Scripting (XAS)\".","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:airmagnet:enterprise:7.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:airmagnet:enterprise:7.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:airmagnet:enterprise:7.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
