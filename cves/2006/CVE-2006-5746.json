The intruder needs to be connected physically to the corporate network and obtain the IP address of a console user before attempting such an attack. The attack can ultimately be used to obtain AirMagnet system user passwords. \n\n- AirMagnet Solution: AirMagnet will release a patch to ensure that the console validates the correctly assigned certificate from the server. Customers can limit the risk of this vulnerability by following standard network security practices to ensure that unauthorized personnel do not gain physical access to the protected network.\n\n- Fix Availability: Patch currently available on MyAirMagnet. Customers should upgrade to the latest version available on MyAirMagnet. Customers running a version of AirMagnet older than 6.1 must upgrade to version 6.1 before upgrading to the current release. Customers can contact AirMagnet Support to obtain the 6.1 release.\n\n"}],"summary":"The console in AirMagnet Enterprise before 7.5 build 6307 does not properly validate the Enterprise Server certificate, which allows remote attackers to read network traffic via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, possibly related to the use of self-signed certificates.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:airmagnet:enterprise:7.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:airmagnet:enterprise:7.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:airmagnet:enterprise:7.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
