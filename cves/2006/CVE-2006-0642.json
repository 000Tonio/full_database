NOTE: since this is related to a configuration setting that has an operational impact that might vary depending on the environment, and the product is claimed to report a message when the compressed file exceeds specified limits, perhaps this should not be included in CVE.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:trend_micro:interscan_messaging_security_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:trend_micro:interscan_messaging_security_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:trend_micro:interscan_web_security_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:trend_micro:interscan_web_security_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:trend_micro:serverprotect:5.58:*:emc:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:trend_micro:serverprotect:5.58:*:emc:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:trend_micro:interscan_messaging_security_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:trend_micro:interscan_web_security_suite:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:trend_micro:serverprotect:5.58:*:emc:*:*:*:*:*"]}
