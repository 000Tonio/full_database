NOTE: the original report specifies the function name as \"drain_squeue,\" but this is likely incorrect. It is reportedly unlikely that this affects systems not using CMT processors.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:sun:solaris:10.0:*:sparc:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:sun:solaris:10.0:*:sparc:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:sun:solaris:10.0:*:sparc:*:*:*:*:*"]}
