Fuzzing techniques involve sending random or malformed messages to a target and monitoring the target's response. The attacker does not initially know how a target will respond to individual messages but by attempting a large number of message variants they may find a variant that trigger's desired behavior. In this attack, the purpose of the fuzzing is to cause the targeted application to return an error including a stack trace, although fuzzing a target can also sometimes cause the target to enter an unstable state, causing a crash. The stack trace enumerates the chain of methods that led up to the point where the error was encountered. This can not only reveal the names of the methods (some of which may have known weaknesses) but possibly also the location of class files and libraries as well as parameter values. In some cases, the stack trace might even disclose sensitive configuration or user information."},{"id":"28","name":"Fuzzing","prerequisites":"","related_weakness":["20","388","74"],"solutions":"Test to ensure that the software behaves as per specification and that there are no unintended side effects.

Fuzzing is a software security and functionality testing method that feeds randomly constructed input to the system and looks for an indication that a failure in response to that input has occurred. Fuzzing treats the system as a black box and is totally free from any preconceptions or assumptions about the system. Fuzzing can help an attacker discover certain assumptions made about user input in the system. Fuzzing gives an attacker a quick way of potentially uncovering some of these assumptions despite not necessarily knowing anything about the internals of the system. These assumptions can then be turned against the system by specially crafting user input that may allow an attacker to achieve his goals."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2019-11-14T13:21:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-388","id":"CVE-2006-6682","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-11-14T13:21:00","references":["http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=394454","http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=116371297325564&w=2","http://secunia.com/advisories/22967","http://www.osvdb.org/30545","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/21102","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/30454"],"refmap":{"bid":["21102"],"bugtraq":["20061113 Chetcpasswd 2.x: multiple vulnerabilities"],"misc":["http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=394454"],"osvdb":["30545"],"secunia":["22967"],"xf":["chetcpasswd-error-message-enumeration(30454)"]},"summary":"Pedro Lineu Orso chetcpasswd 2.3.3 provides a different error message when a request with a valid username fails, compared to a request with an invalid username, which allows remote attackers to determine valid usernames on the system.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:chetcpasswd_project:chetcpasswd:2.3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:chetcpasswd_project:chetcpasswd:2.3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:chetcpasswd_project:chetcpasswd:2.3.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
