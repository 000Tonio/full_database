Use methods that limit entity expansion and throw exceptions on attempted entity expansion. Implementation: Disable altogether the use of inline DTD schemas in your XML parsing objects. If must use DTD, normalize, filter and white list and parse with methods and routines that will detect entity expansion from untrusted sources.","summary":"An attacker submits an XML document to a target application where the XML document uses nested entity expansion to produce an excessively large output XML. XML allows the definition of macro-like structures that can be used to simplify the creation of complex structures. However, this capability can be abused to create excessive demands on a processor's CPU and memory. A small number of nested expansions can result in an exponential growth in demands on memory."},{"id":"492","name":"Regular Expression Exponential Blowup","prerequisites":"This type of an attack requires the ability to identify hosts running a poorly implemented Regex, and the ability to send crafted input to exploit the regular expression.","related_weakness":["400"],"solutions":"Test custom written Regex with fuzzing to determine if the Regex is a poor one. Add timeouts to processes that handle the Regex logic. If an evil Regex is found rewrite it as a good Regex.","summary":"An adversary may execute an attack on a program that uses a poor Regular Expression(Regex) implementation by choosing input that results in an extreme situation for the Regex. A typical extreme situation operates at exponential time compared to the input size. This is due to most implementations using a Nondeterministic Finite Automaton(NFA) state machine to be built by the Regex algorithm since NFA allows backtracking and thus more complex regular expressions. The algorithm builds a finite state machine and based on the input transitions through all the states until the end of the input is reached. NFA engines may evaluate each character in the input string multiple times during the backtracking. The algorithm tries each path through the NFA one by one until a match is found; the malicious input is crafted so every path is tried which results in a failure. Exploitation of the Regex results in programs hanging or taking a very long time to complete. These attacks may target various layers of the Internet due to regular expressions being used in validation."},{"id":"147","name":"XML Ping of the Death","prerequisites":"The target must receive and process XML transactions.","related_weakness":["400","770"],"solutions":"Design: Build throttling mechanism into the resource allocation. Provide for a timeout mechanism for allocated resources whose transaction does not complete within a specified interval. Implementation: Provide for network flow control and traffic shaping to control access to the resources.","summary":"An attacker initiates a resource depletion attack where a large number of small XML messages are delivered at a sufficiently rapid rate to cause a denial of service or crash of the target. Transactions such as repetitive SOAP transactions can deplete resources faster than a simple flooding attack because of the additional resources used by the SOAP protocol and the resources necessary to process SOAP messages. The transactions used are immaterial as long as they cause resource utilization on the target. In other words, this is a normal flooding attack augmented by using messages that will require extra processing on the target."}],"cvss":7.8,"cvss-time":"2018-10-18T16:32:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C","cwe":"CWE-400","id":"CVE-2006-1364","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2018-10-18T16:32:00","references":["http://hackingspirits.com/vuln-rnd/w3wp-remote-dos.zip","http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2006-March/044291.html","http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2006-March/044292.html","http://securitytracker.com/id?1015825","http://www.securiteam.com/windowsntfocus/5KP0O0KI0Y.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/428622/100/0/threaded","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/17188","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/25392","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/1601"],"refmap":{"bid":["17188"],"bugtraq":["20060322 w3wp remote DoS"],"exploit-db":["1601"],"fulldisc":["20060322 w3wp remote DoS","20060322 w3wp remote DoS due to improper reference of STA COM components in ASP.NET"],"misc":["http://hackingspirits.com/vuln-rnd/w3wp-remote-dos.zip","http://www.securiteam.com/windowsntfocus/5KP0O0KI0Y.html"],"sectrack":["1015825"],"xf":["ms-aspnet-w3wp-dos(25392)"]},"summary":"Microsoft w3wp (aka w3wp.exe) does not properly handle when the AspCompat directive is not used when referencing COM components in ASP.NET, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption or crash) by repeatedly requesting each of several documents that refer to COM components, or are restricted documents located under the ASP.NET application path.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:asp.net:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:asp.net:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:asp.net:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:asp.net:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:asp.net:1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:asp.net:1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:asp.net:1.1:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:asp.net:1.1:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:asp.net:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:asp.net:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:asp.net:1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:asp.net:1.1:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
