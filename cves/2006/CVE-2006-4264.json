NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a third party, who states that the $mosConfig_absolute_path variable is only used within a function definition.  CVE source code analysis on 20060824 is not conclusive but tends to concur with the dispute.  In addition, it appears that the component name is actually \"lmtg_myhomepage\".","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mambo:mtg_myhomepage_component:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mambo:mtg_myhomepage_component:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:mambo:mtg_myhomepage_component:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
