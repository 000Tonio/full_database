A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":4.7,"cvss-time":"2018-10-30T16:25:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2006-6275","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2018-10-30T16:25:00","oval":[{"accepted":"2007-09-27T08:57:40.779-04:00","class":"vulnerability","contributors":[{"name":"Pai Peng","organization":"Opsware, Inc."}],"definition_extensions":[{"comment":"Solaris 8 (SPARC) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:1539"},{"comment":"Solaris 8 (SPARC) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:1539"},{"comment":"Solaris 8 (x86) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:2059"},{"comment":"Solaris 8 (x86) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:2059"},{"comment":"Solaris 9 (x86) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:1683"},{"comment":"Solaris 9 (x86) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:1683"},{"comment":"Solaris 9 (x86) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:1683"},{"comment":"Solaris 9 (x86) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:1683"},{"comment":"Solaris 10 (x86) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:1926"},{"comment":"Solaris 10 (x86) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:1926"},{"comment":"Solaris 8 (SPARC) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:1539"},{"comment":"Solaris 9 (SPARC) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:1457"},{"comment":"Solaris 9 (SPARC) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:1457"},{"comment":"Solaris 9 (SPARC) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:1457"},{"comment":"Solaris 9 (SPARC) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:1457"},{"comment":"Solaris 10 (SPARC) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:1440"},{"comment":"Solaris 10 (SPARC) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:1440"},{"comment":"Solaris 8 (x86) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:2059"}],"description":"Race condition in the kernel in Sun Solaris 8 through 10 allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) via unspecified vectors, possibly related to the exitlwps function and SIGKILL and /proc PCAGENT signals.","family":"unix","id":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:1626","status":"accepted","submitted":"2007-08-10T12:25:21.000-04:00","title":"A Security Vulnerability in the Solaris Kernel May Allow a Denial of Service (DoS) Condition to Occur","version":"36"}],"references":["http://secunia.com/advisories/23187","http://securitytracker.com/id?1017321","http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-102574-1","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/21372","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2006/4792","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/30637","https://oval.cisecurity.org/repository/search/definition/oval%3Aorg.mitre.oval%3Adef%3A1626"],"refmap":{"bid":["21372"],"sectrack":["1017321"],"secunia":["23187"],"sunalert":["102574"],"vupen":["ADV-2006-4792"],"xf":["solaris-sigkill-dos(30637)"]},"summary":"Race condition in the kernel in Sun Solaris 8 through 10 allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) via unspecified vectors, possibly related to the exitlwps function and SIGKILL and /proc PCAGENT signals.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:sun:solaris:8.0:*:x86:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:sun:solaris:8.0:*:x86:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:sun:solaris:9.0:*:sparc:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:sun:solaris:9.0:*:sparc:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:sun:solaris:9.0:*:x86:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:sun:solaris:9.0:*:x86:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:sun:solaris:10.0:*:sparc:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:sun:solaris:10.0:*:sparc:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:sun:solaris:10.0:*:x86:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:sun:solaris:10.0:*:x86:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:sun:sunos:5.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:sun:sunos:5.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:sun:solaris:8.0:*:x86:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:sun:solaris:9.0:*:sparc:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:sun:solaris:9.0:*:x86:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:sun:solaris:10.0:*:sparc:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:sun:solaris:10.0:*:x86:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:sun:sunos:5.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
