This vulnerability exists only in Windows OS environments before XP.  For some reason it would not let me notate that in the \"vulnerable software\" section.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:counterpane:password_safe:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:counterpane:password_safe:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:counterpane:password_safe:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
