NOTE: the original researcher claims that issue has been disputed by the vendor, and that the vendor stated \"as far as I can tell, this is neither an exploit nor a vulnerability.  The above report describes a local bug in mIRC.\"  It could be that this is only exploitable by the user of the application, and thus would not cross privilege boundaries unless under an otherwise restrictive environment such as a kiosk.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:khaled_mardam-bey:mirc:6.16:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:khaled_mardam-bey:mirc:6.16:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:khaled_mardam-bey:mirc:6.16:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
