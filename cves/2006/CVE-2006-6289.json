NOTE: it could be argued that this vulnerability is due to a bug in the unset PHP command (CVE-2006-3017) and the proper fix should be in PHP; if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in wBB Lite. Successful exploitation requires that \"magic_quotes_gpc\" is disabled, and that \"register_globals\" is enabled.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:woltlab:burning_board_lite:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:woltlab:burning_board_lite:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:woltlab:burning_board_lite:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
