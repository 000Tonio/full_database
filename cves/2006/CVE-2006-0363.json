NOTE: it could be argued that local-only password recovery is inherently insecure because the decryption methods and keys must be stored somewhere on the local system, and are thus inherently accessible with varying degrees of effort.  Perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:msn_messenger:7.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:msn_messenger:7.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:msn_messenger:7.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
