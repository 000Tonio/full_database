NOTE: it could be argued that this is a laws-of-physics vulnerability that is a fundamental design limitation of certain hardware implementations, so perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:tor:tor:0.1.1.26:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:tor:tor:0.1.1.26:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:tor:tor:0.1.1.26:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
