NOTE: this issue might be resultant from the poor authentication as identified by CVE-2006-0182.  Since the design of the product allows the administrator to edit the code, perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE, except as a consequence of CVE-2006-0182.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:acal:calendar_project:2.2.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:acal:calendar_project:2.2.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:acal:calendar_project:2.2.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
