NOTE: it is not clear whether this is a site-specific issue; however, the claimed codebase relationship with PunBB might be relevant.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:revoboard:revoboard:1.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:revoboard:revoboard:1.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:revoboard:revoboard:1.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
