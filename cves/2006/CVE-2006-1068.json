This vulnerability may affects NetGear Router models 614 and 624 (including WGR614, WGT624, WGT624SC, WGU624, and possibly others) and is most likely related to VXWorks.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:netgear:netgear_router:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:netgear:netgear_router:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:h:netgear:netgear_router:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
