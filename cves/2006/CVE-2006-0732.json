Details will be updated after the grace period has ended.  NOTE: SAP Business Connector is an OEM version of webMethods Integration Server.  webMethods states that this issue can only occur when the product is installed as root/admin, and if the attacker has access to a general purpose port; however, both are discouraged in the documentation.  In addition, the attacker must already have acquired administrative privileges through other means. Apply patches (see SAP note 906401 and 908349).","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:business_connector:4.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:business_connector:4.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:business_connector:4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:business_connector:4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sap:business_connector:4.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:sap:business_connector:4.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
