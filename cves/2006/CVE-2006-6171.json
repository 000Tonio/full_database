NOTE: in November 2006, the role of CommandBufferSize was originally associated with CVE-2006-5815, but this was an error stemming from a vague initial disclosure.  NOTE: ProFTPD developers dispute this issue, saying that the relevant memory location is overwritten by assignment before further use within the affected function, so this is not a vulnerability.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:proftpd_project:proftpd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:proftpd_project:proftpd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:proftpd_project:proftpd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
