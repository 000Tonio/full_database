NOTE: this script might also allow attackers to generate the server-side \"secret\" URL without determining the original password, but this possibility was not discussed by the original researcher.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:pswd.js:pswd.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:pswd.js:pswd.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:pswd.js:pswd.js:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
