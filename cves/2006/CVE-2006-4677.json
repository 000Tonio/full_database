NOTE: this issue was disputed by a third-party researcher who stated that the _REQUEST parameters were dynamically unset at the beginning of the file.  Another researcher noted, and CVE agrees, that the unset PHP function can be bypassed (CVE-2006-3017).  If this issue is due to a vulnerability in PHP, then it should be excluded from CVE.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:phpopenchat:phpopenchat:2.3.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:phpopenchat:phpopenchat:2.3.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:phpopenchat:phpopenchat:3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:phpopenchat:phpopenchat:3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:phpopenchat:phpopenchat:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:phpopenchat:phpopenchat:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:phpopenchat:phpopenchat:2.3.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:phpopenchat:phpopenchat:3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:phpopenchat:phpopenchat:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
