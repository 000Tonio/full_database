A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":3.7,"cvss-time":"2018-10-03T21:36:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2006-1057","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-10-03T21:36:00","oval":[{"accepted":"2013-04-29T04:01:32.622-04:00","class":"vulnerability","contributors":[{"name":"Aharon Chernin","organization":"SCAP.com, LLC"},{"name":"Dragos Prisaca","organization":"G2, Inc."}],"definition_extensions":[{"comment":"The operating system installed on the system is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:11831"},{"comment":"CentOS Linux 4.x","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:16636"},{"comment":"Oracle Linux 4.x","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:15990"}],"description":"Race condition in daemon/slave.c in gdm before 2.14.1 allows local users to gain privileges via a symlink attack when gdm performs chown and chgrp operations on the .ICEauthority file.","family":"unix","id":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:10092","status":"accepted","submitted":"2010-07-09T03:56:16-04:00","title":"Race condition in daemon/slave.c in gdm before 2.14.1 allows local users to gain privileges via a symlink attack when gdm performs chown and chgrp operations on the .ICEauthority file.","version":"29"}],"redhat":{"advisories":[{"bugzilla":{"id":"1618026","title":"CVE-2006-1057 security flaw"},"oval":{"OR":[{"comment":"Red Hat Enterprise Linux must be installed","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhba:tst:20070304026"},{"AND":[{"comment":"Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 is installed","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhba:tst:20070304025"},{"comment":"gdm is earlier than 1:2.6.0.5-7.rhel4.15","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20070286001"},{"comment":"gdm is signed with Red Hat master key","oval":"oval:com.redhat.rhsa:tst:20070286002"}]}]},"rhsa":{"id":"RHSA-2007:0286","released":"2007-05-01","severity":"Low","title":"RHSA-2007:0286: gdm security and bug fix update (Low)"}}],"rpms":["gdm-1:2.6.0.5-7.rhel4.15","gdm-debuginfo-1:2.6.0.5-7.rhel4.15"]},"references":["http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/gdm2/daemon/slave.c?r1=1.260&r2=1.261","http://www.debian.org/security/2006/dsa-1040","http://www.mandriva.com/security/advisories?name=MDKSA-2006:083","http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2007-0286.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/17635","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2006/1465","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=188303","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/26092","https://oval.cisecurity.org/repository/search/definition/oval%3Aorg.mitre.oval%3Adef%3A10092","https://usn.ubuntu.com/278-1/","https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2006-April/msg00160.html"],"refmap":{"bid":["17635"],"confirm":["http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/gdm2/daemon/slave.c?r1=1.260&r2=1.261","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=188303"],"debian":["DSA-1040"],"fedora":["FEDORA-2006-338"],"mandriva":["MDKSA-2006:083"],"ubuntu":["USN-278-1"],"vupen":["ADV-2006-1465"],"xf":["gdm-slavec-symlink(26092)"]},"statements":[{"contributor":"Mark J Cox","lastmodified":"2006-09-19","organization":"Red Hat","statement":"Red Hat is aware of this issue and is tracking it via the following bug:\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=188302\n\nThe Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact, a future update may address this flaw.
