NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the Apache security team, saying \"It is by design that PHP allows scripts to process any request method.  A script which does not explicitly verify the request method will hence be processed as normal for arbitrary methods.  It is therefore expected behaviour that one cannot implement per-method access control using the Apache configuration alone, which is the assumption made in this report.\"","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:php:php:4.4.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:php:php:4.4.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:php:php:4.4.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
