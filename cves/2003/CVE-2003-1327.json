Successful exploitation requires that the option \"MAIL_ADMIN\" has been enabled (not default), that anonymous users have write permissions on a folder, and that the program has been compiled on a system where very long paths are permitted.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:washington_university:wu-ftpd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:washington_university:wu-ftpd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:washington_university:wu-ftpd:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
