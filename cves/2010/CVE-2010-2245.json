If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5.8,"cvss-time":"2017-08-16T17:36:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2010-2245","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2017-08-16T17:36:00","references":["http://marc.info/?l=wink-user&m=127843482925387&w=2","https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/wink/trunk/security/CVE-2010-2245.pdf"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/wink/trunk/security/CVE-2010-2245.pdf"],"mlist":["[MARC] 20100706 [Important] Wink security advisory CVE-2010-2245"]},"summary":"XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in Apache Wink 1.1.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files or cause a denial of service via a crafted XML document.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:wink:0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:wink:0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:wink:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:wink:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:wink:1.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:wink:1.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:wink:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:wink:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:apache:wink:0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:apache:wink:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:apache:wink:1.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:apache:wink:1.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
