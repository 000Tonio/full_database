The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":6.9,"cvss-time":"2022-09-06T17:52:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2010-5250","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2022-09-06T17:52:00","references":["http://secunia.com/advisories/41215","http://www.corelan.be:8800/index.php/2010/08/25/dll-hijacking-kb-2269637-the-unofficial-list/"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://www.corelan.be:8800/index.php/2010/08/25/dll-hijacking-kb-2269637-the-unofficial-list/"],"secunia":["41215"]},"summary":"Untrusted search path vulnerability in the pthread_win32_process_attach_np function in pthreadGC2.dll in Pthreads-win32 2.8.0 allows local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse quserex.dll file in the current working directory.
