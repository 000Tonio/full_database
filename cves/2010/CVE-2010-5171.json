The adversary can leverage a race condition by \"running the race\", modifying the resource and modifying the normal execution flow.

A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":6.2,"cvss-time":"2012-08-27T04:00:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2010-5171","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2012-08-27T04:00:00","references":["http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/bugtraq/2010-05/0026.html","http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2010-05/0066.html","http://countermeasures.trendmicro.eu/you-just-cant-trust-a-drunk/","http://matousec.com/info/advisories/khobe-8.0-earthquake-for-windows-desktop-security-software.php","http://matousec.com/info/articles/khobe-8.0-earthquake-for-windows-desktop-security-software.php","http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00001949.html","http://www.osvdb.org/67660","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/39924","http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/07/argument_switch_av_bypass/"],"refmap":{"bid":["39924"],"bugtraq":["20100505 KHOBE - 8.0 earthquake for Windows desktop security software"],"fulldisc":["20100505 KHOBE - 8.0 earthquake for Windows desktop security software"],"misc":["http://countermeasures.trendmicro.eu/you-just-cant-trust-a-drunk/","http://matousec.com/info/advisories/khobe-8.0-earthquake-for-windows-desktop-security-software.php","http://matousec.com/info/articles/khobe-8.0-earthquake-for-windows-desktop-security-software.php","http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00001949.html","http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/07/argument_switch_av_bypass/"],"osvdb":["67660"]},"summary":"** DISPUTED ** Race condition in Outpost Security Suite Pro 6.7.3.3063.452.0726 and 7.0.3330.505.1221 BETA on Windows XP allows local users to bypass kernel-mode hook handlers, and execute dangerous code that would otherwise be blocked by a handler but not blocked by signature-based malware detection, via certain user-space memory changes during hook-handler execution, aka an argument-switch attack or a KHOBE attack.
