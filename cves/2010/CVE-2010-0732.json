A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":6.2,"cvss-time":"2023-02-13T04:16:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2010-0732","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2023-02-13T04:16:00","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/03/16/9","http://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=0748cf563d0d0d03001a62589f13be16a8ec06c1","http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-screensaver/commit/?id=ab08cc93f2dc6223c8c00bfa1ca4f2d89069dbe0","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=565527","http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/gtk+/2.18/gtk+-2.18.5.news","https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=598476","http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Gnome-Bildschirmsperre-in-OpenSuse-Linux-wirkungslos-2-Update-928580.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/03/05/2","http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-screensaver/commit/?h=gnome-2-28&id=98f8a22412cf388217fd5b88915eadd274d68520","https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-screensaver/+bug/446395","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2010/02/12/1","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2010-04/msg00001.html","http://secunia.com/advisories/39317","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/38211","http://www.mandriva.com/security/advisories?name=MDVSA-2010:109"],"refmap":{"bid":["38211"],"confirm":["http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/gtk+/2.18/gtk+-2.18.5.news","http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-screensaver/commit/?h=gnome-2-28&id=98f8a22412cf388217fd5b88915eadd274d68520","http://git.gnome.org/browse/gnome-screensaver/commit/?id=ab08cc93f2dc6223c8c00bfa1ca4f2d89069dbe0","http://git.gnome.org/browse/gtk+/commit/?id=0748cf563d0d0d03001a62589f13be16a8ec06c1","https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-screensaver/+bug/446395","https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=598476","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=565527"],"mandriva":["MDVSA-2010:109"],"misc":["http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Gnome-Bildschirmsperre-in-OpenSuse-Linux-wirkungslos-2-Update-928580.html"],"mlist":["[oss-security] 20100212 CVE Request: gnome-screensaver termination by pressing \"Enter\"","[oss-security] 20100305 Re: CVE Request: gnome-screensaver termination by pressing \"Enter\"","[oss-security] 20100316 Re: Re: CVE Request: gnome-screensaver termination by pressing \"Enter\""],"secunia":["39317"],"suse":["SUSE-SR:2010:008"]},"summary":"gdk/gdkwindow.c in GTK+ before 2.18.5, as used in gnome-screensaver before 2.28.1, performs implicit paints on windows of type GDK_WINDOW_FOREIGN, which triggers an X error in certain circumstances and consequently allows physically proximate attackers to bypass screen locking and access an unattended workstation by pressing the Enter key many times.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:gtk:gtk\\+:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:gtk:gtk\\+:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:gnome:screensaver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:gnome:screensaver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:gtk:gtk\\+:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
