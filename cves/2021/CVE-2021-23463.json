If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.4,"cvss-time":"2022-04-28T14:53:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-23463","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-04-28T14:53:00","references":["https://github.com/h2database/h2database/issues/3195","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMH2DATABASE-1769238","https://github.com/h2database/h2database/pull/3199","https://github.com/h2database/h2database/commit/d83285fd2e48fb075780ee95badee6f5a15ea7f8%23diff-008c2e4462609982199cd83e7cf6f1d6b41296b516783f6752c44b9f15dc7bc3","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"],"summary":"The package com.h2database:h2 from 1.4.198 and before 2.0.202 are vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) Injection via the org.h2.jdbc.JdbcSQLXML class object, when it receives parsed string data from org.h2.jdbc.JdbcResultSet.getSQLXML() method.
