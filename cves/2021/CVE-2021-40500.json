If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2021-10-18T18:21:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-40500","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-10-18T18:21:00","references":["https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3074693","https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=587169983"],"summary":"SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform (Crystal Reports) - versions 420, 430, allows an unauthenticated attacker to exploit missing XML validations at endpoints to read sensitive data.
