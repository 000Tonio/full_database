If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2021-10-19T19:19:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-20801","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-10-19T19:19:00","references":["https://kb.cybozu.support/article/37423","https://jvn.jp/en/jp/JVN52694228/index.html"],"summary":"Cybozu Remote Service 3.1.8 to 3.1.9 allows a remote authenticated attacker to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks and obtain the information stored in the product via unspecified vectors.
