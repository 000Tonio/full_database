Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":10,"cvss-time":"2021-09-07T16:32:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-34066","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2021-09-07T16:32:00","references":["https://github.com/EdgeGallery/developer-be/issues/1"],"summary":"An issue was discovered in EdgeGallery/developer before v1.0.
