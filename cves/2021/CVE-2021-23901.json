If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition.

XML external entity injection (also known as XXE) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an application's processing of XML data. It often allows an attacker to view files on the application server filesystem, and to interact with any back-end or external systems that the application itself can access. This issue is fixed in Apache Nutch 1.18.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:nutch:0.8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:nutch:0.8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:nutch:0.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:nutch:0.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:netapp:snap_creator_framework:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:netapp:snap_creator_framework:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:apache:nutch:0.8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:apache:nutch:0.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netapp:snap_creator_framework:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
