When the executable loads the resource (such as an image file or configuration file) the attacker has modified the file to either execute malicious code directly or manipulate the target process (e.g. application server) to execute based on the malicious configuration parameters.

The endpoint file may be either output or input. If the file is output, the result is that the endpoint is modified, instead of a file at the intended location. Modifications to the endpoint file may include appending, overwriting, corrupting, changing permissions, or other modifications. In some variants of this attack the attacker may be able to control the change to a file while in other cases they cannot. The former is especially damaging since the attacker may be able to grant themselves increased privileges or insert false information, but the latter can also be damaging as it can expose sensitive information or corrupt or destroy vital system or application files. Alternatively, the endpoint file may serve as input to the targeted application. This can be used to feed malformed input into the target or to cause the target to process different information, possibly allowing the attacker to control the actions of the target or to cause the target to expose information to the attacker. Moreover, the actions taken on the endpoint file are undertaken with the permissions of the targeted user or application, which may exceed the permissions that the attacker would normally have."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2022-10-25T15:53:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N","cwe":"CWE-59","id":"CVE-2021-21272","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-10-25T15:53:00","references":["https://github.com/deislabs/oras/commit/96cd90423303f1bb42bd043cb4c36085e6e91e8e","https://github.com/deislabs/oras/releases/tag/v0.9.0","https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/oras","https://github.com/deislabs/oras/security/advisories/GHSA-g5v4-5x39-vwhx"],"summary":"ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts to OCI Conformant registries. ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0, there is a \"zip-slip\" vulnerability. The directory support feature allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras` CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For `oras` package users, the workaround is to not use `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:deislabs:oras:0.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:deislabs:oras:0.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:deislabs:oras:0.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:deislabs:oras:0.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:deislabs:oras:0.6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:deislabs:oras:0.6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:deislabs:oras:0.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:deislabs:oras:0.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:deislabs:oras:0.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:deislabs:oras:0.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:deislabs:oras:0.8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:deislabs:oras:0.8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:deislabs:oras:0.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:deislabs:oras:0.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:deislabs:oras:0.6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:deislabs:oras:0.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:deislabs:oras:0.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:deislabs:oras:0.8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
