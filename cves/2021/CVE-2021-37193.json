In general, content-spoofing within an application API can be employed to stage many different types of attacks varied based on the attackers' intent. When the goal is to spread malware, deceptive content is created such as modified links, buttons, or images, that entice users to click on those items, all of which point to a malicious URI. The techniques require use of specialized software that allow the attacker to man-in-the-middle communications between the web browser and the remote system in order to change the destination of various application interface elements."},{"id":"385","name":"Transaction or Event Tampering via Application API Manipulation","prerequisites":"Targeted software is utilizing application framework APIs","related_weakness":["311","345","346","471","602"],"solutions":"","summary":"An attacker hosts or joins an event or transaction within an application framework in order to change the content of messages or items that are being exchanged.

Despite the use of MITM software, the attack is actually directed at the server, as the client is one node in a series of content brokers that pass information along to the application framework.

Performing this attack allows the attacker to manipulate content in such a way as to produce messages or content that looks authentic but contains links/buttons that point to an attacker controlled destination. Some applications make navigation remapping more difficult to detect because the actual HREF values of images, profile elements, and links/buttons are masked. One example would be to place an image in a user's photo gallery that when clicked upon redirected the user to an off-site location. Also, traditional web vulnerabilities (such as CSRF) can be constructed with remapped buttons or links. In some cases navigation remapping can be used for Phishing attacks or even means to artificially boost the page view, user site reputation, or click-fraud."},{"id":"388","name":"Application API Button Hijacking","prerequisites":"Targeted software is utilizing application framework APIs","related_weakness":["311","345","346","471","602"],"solutions":"","summary":"An attacker manipulates either egress or ingress data from a client within an application framework in order to change the destination and/or content of buttons displayed to a user within API messages.
