If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2021-12-21T01:50:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-45096","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-12-21T01:50:00","references":["https://github.com/dawid-czarnecki/public-vulnerabilities","https://www.knime.com/whats-new-in-knime-45","https://www.knime.com/changelog-v45"],"summary":"KNIME Analytics Platform before 4.5.0 is vulnerable to XXE (external XML entity injection) via a crafted workflow file (.knwf), aka AP-17730.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:knime:knime_analytics_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:knime:knime_analytics_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:knime:knime_analytics_platform:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
