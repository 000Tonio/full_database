Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":9,"cvss-time":"2021-12-02T13:40:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-43360","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2021-12-02T13:40:00","references":["https://www.twcert.org.tw/tw/cp-132-5355-6e339-1.html"],"summary":"Sunnet eHRD e-mail delivery task scheduleâ€™s serialization function has inadequate input object validation and restriction, which allows a post-authenticated remote attacker with database access privilege, to execute arbitrary code and control the system or interrupt services.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sun:ehrd:8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sun:ehrd:8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sun:ehrd:9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sun:ehrd:9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sun:ehrd:8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:sun:ehrd:9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
