Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-36336","impact":{},"last-modified":"2021-12-21T17:18:00","references":["https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/000193079"],"summary":"Wyse Management Suite 3.3.1 and below versions contain a deserialization vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated attacker to execute code on the affected system.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
