In versions up to and including 0.3.1 there is a heap-based out of bounds write in parse_die() when reversing an AMD64 ELF binary with DWARF debug info. When a malicious AMD64 ELF binary is opened by a victim user, Rizin may crash or execute unintended actions. No workaround are known and users are advised to upgrade.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:rizin:rizin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:rizin:rizin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:rizin:rizin:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
