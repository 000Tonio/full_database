Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2021-08-05T15:42:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-29781","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-08-05T15:42:00","references":["https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/203091","https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6476668"],"summary":"IBM Partner Engagement Manager 2.0 could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system, caused by an unsafe deserialization flaw.
