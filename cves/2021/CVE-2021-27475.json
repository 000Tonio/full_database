Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2022-03-29T17:59:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-27475","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-03-29T17:59:00","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-21-133-01","https://rockwellautomation.custhelp.com/app/answers/answer_view/a_id/1131435"],"summary":"Rockwell Automation Connected Components Workbench v12.00.00 and prior does not limit the objects that can be deserialized.
