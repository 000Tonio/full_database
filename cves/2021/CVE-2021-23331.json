The method prepareDownloadFilecreates creates a temporary file with the permissions bits of -rw-r--r-- on unix-like systems. On unix-like systems, the system temporary directory is shared between users. As such, the contents of the file downloaded by downloadFileFromResponse will be visible to all other users on the local system. A workaround fix for this issue is to set the system property java.io.tmpdir to a safe directory as remediation. Note: This version of the SDK is end of life and no longer maintained, please upgrade to the latest version.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:squareup:connect_java_software_development_kit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:squareup:connect_java_software_development_kit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:squareup:connect_java_software_development_kit:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
