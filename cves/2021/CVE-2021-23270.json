This occurs when a link prefix route points to a point-to-point link, a destination IPv6 address belongs to the prefix and is not a local IPv6 address, and a router advertisement is received with at least one global unique IPv6 prefix for which the on-link flag is set.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:gargoyle-router:gargoyle:1.12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:gargoyle-router:gargoyle:1.12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:gargoyle-router:gargoyle:1.12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
