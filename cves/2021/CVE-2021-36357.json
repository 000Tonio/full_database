The fix is to use the right endian conversion function.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:openpowerfoundation:skiboot:2.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:openpowerfoundation:skiboot:2.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:openpowerfoundation:skiboot:2.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
