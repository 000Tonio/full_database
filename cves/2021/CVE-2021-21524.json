Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":10,"cvss-time":"2021-04-22T14:43:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-21524","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2021-04-22T14:43:00","references":["https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000184753/dsa-2021-054-dell-emc-srm-and-dell-emc-storage-monitoring-and-reporting-smr-security-update-for-multiple-vulnerabilities"],"summary":"Dell SRM versions prior to 4.5.0.1 and Dell SMR versions prior to 4.5.0.1 contain an Untrusted Deserialization Vulnerability.
