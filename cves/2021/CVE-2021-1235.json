Implementation: Obfuscate database type in Database API's error message.","summary":"An attacker sends a series of probes to a web application in order to elicit version-dependent and type-dependent behavior that assists in identifying the target. An attacker could learn information such as software versions, error pages, and response headers, variations in implementations of the HTTP protocol, directory structures, and other similar information about the targeted service. This information can then be used by an attacker to formulate a targeted attack plan. While web application fingerprinting is not intended to be damaging (although certain activities, such as network scans, can sometimes cause disruptions to vulnerable applications inadvertently) it may often pave the way for more damaging attacks."}],"cvss":4.9,"cvss-time":"2021-01-27T20:47:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-497","id":"CVE-2021-1235","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-01-27T20:47:00","references":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-vinfdis-MC8L58dj"],"refmap":{"cisco":["20210120 Cisco SD-WAN vManage Information Disclosure Vulnerability"]},"summary":"A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to read sensitive database files on an affected system.
