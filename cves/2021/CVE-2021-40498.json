The vulnerability is related to Android implementation methods that are widely used across Android mobile applications, and such methods are embedded into the SAP SuccessFactors mobile application. These Android methods begin executing once the user accesses their profile on the mobile application. While executing, it can also pick up the activities from other Android applications that are running in the background of the users device and are using the same types of methods in the application. Such vulnerability can also lead to phishing attacks that can be used for staging other types of attacks.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:successfactors_mobile:-:*:*:*:*:android:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:successfactors_mobile:-:*:*:*:*:android:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sap:successfactors_mobile:-:*:*:*:*:android:*:*"]}
