XML Routing Detour Attacks are Man in the Middle type attacks. The attacker compromises or inserts an intermediate system in the processing of the XML message. For example, WS-Routing can be used to specify a series of nodes or intermediaries through which content is passed. If any of the intermediate nodes in this route are compromised by an attacker they could be used for a routing detour attack. From the compromised system the attacker is able to route the XML process to other nodes of his or her choice and modify the responses so that the normal chain of processing is unaware of the interception. This system can forward the message to an outside entity and hide the forwarding and processing from the legitimate processing systems by altering the header information."}],"cvss":3.5,"cvss-time":"2021-11-06T02:49:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-610","id":"CVE-2021-25740","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-11-06T02:49:00","references":["https://groups.google.com/g/kubernetes-security-announce/c/WYE9ptrhSLE","https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/103675","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211014-0001/"],"summary":"A security issue was discovered with Kubernetes that could enable users to send network traffic to locations they would otherwise not have access to via a confused deputy attack.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:kubernetes:kubernetes:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:kubernetes:kubernetes:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:kubernetes:kubernetes:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
