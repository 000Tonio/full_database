Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":3.5,"cvss-time":"2022-08-09T13:28:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-43853","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-08-09T13:28:00","references":["https://github.com/michaelschwarz/Ajax.NET-Professional/security/advisories/GHSA-5q7q-qqw2-hjq7","https://github.com/michaelschwarz/Ajax.NET-Professional/commit/c89e39b9679fcb8ab6644fe21cc7e652cb615e2b","https://github.com/michaelschwarz/Ajax.NET-Professional/releases/tag/v21.12.22.1"],"summary":"Ajax.NET Professional (AjaxPro) is an AJAX framework available for Microsoft ASP.NET.
