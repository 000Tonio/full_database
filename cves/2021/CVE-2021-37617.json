The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute.

Exploitation of this preferential search order can allow an attacker to make the loading process load the adversary's rogue library rather than the legitimate library. This attack can be leveraged with many different libraries and with many different loading processes.

The Nextcloud Desktop Client invokes its uninstaller script when being installed to make sure there are no remnants of previous installations. In versions 3.0.3 through 3.2.4, the Client searches the `Uninstall.exe` file in a folder that can be written by regular users. This could lead to a case where a malicious user creates a malicious `Uninstall.exe`, which would be executed with administrative privileges on the Nextcloud Desktop Client installation. This issue is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop Client version 3.3.0. As a workaround, do not allow untrusted users to create content in the `C:\\` system folder and verify that there is no malicious `C:\\Uninstall.exe` file on the system.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.1.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.1.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.1.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.1.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.1.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.1.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.2.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.2.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.2.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.2.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.2.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.2.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.2.0:rc3:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.2.0:rc3:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.1.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.1.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.1.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.2.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.2.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.2.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.2.0:rc3:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:nextcloud:desktop:3.2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
