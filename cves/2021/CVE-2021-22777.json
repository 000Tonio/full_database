Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2022-01-31T19:43:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-22777","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-01-31T19:43:00","references":["http://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Doc_Ref=SEVD-2021-194-03"],"summary":"A CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability exists that could cause code execution by opening a malicious project file.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:schneider-electric:sosafe_configurable:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:schneider-electric:sosafe_configurable:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:schneider-electric:sosafe_configurable:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
