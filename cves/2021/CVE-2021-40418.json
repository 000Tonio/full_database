Upon destruction of the object that owns it, the uninitialized member will be dereferenced and then destroyed using the object’s virtual destructor. Due to the object property being uninitialized, this can result in dereferencing an arbitrary pointer for the object’s virtual method table, which can result in code execution under the context of the application.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:blackmagicdesign:davinci_resolve:17.3.1.0005:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:blackmagicdesign:davinci_resolve:17.3.1.0005:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:blackmagicdesign:davinci_resolve:17.3.1.0005:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
