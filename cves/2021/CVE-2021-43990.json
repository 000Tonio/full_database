If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":2.6,"cvss-time":"2022-10-17T18:12:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-43990","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-10-17T18:12:00","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-109-03"],"summary":"The affected product is vulnerable to a network-based attack by threat actors supplying a crafted, malicious XML payload designed to trigger an external entity reference call.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:fanuc:roboguide:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:fanuc:roboguide:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:fanuc:roboguide:9.40083.00.05:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:fanuc:roboguide:9.40083.00.05:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:fanuc:roboguide:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fanuc:roboguide:9.40083.00.05:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
