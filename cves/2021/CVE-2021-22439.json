Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":9.3,"cvss-time":"2021-07-02T19:57:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-22439","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2021-07-02T19:57:00","references":["https://www.huawei.com/en/psirt/security-advisories/huawei-sa-20210619-01-injection-en"],"summary":"There is a deserialization vulnerability in Huawei AnyOffice V200R006C10.
