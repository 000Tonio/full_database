We assume that the USB splitter supplies power to some speakers. The power indicator LED of the USB splitter is connected directly to the power line, as a result, the intensity of the USB splitter's power indicator LED is correlative to its power consumption. The sound played by the connected speakers affects the USB splitter's power consumption and as a result is also correlative to the light intensity of the LED. By analyzing measurements obtained from an electro-optical sensor directed at the power indicator LED of the USB splitter, we can recover the sound played by the connected speakers.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:benda:miracase_hmub500_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:benda:miracase_hmub500_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:benda:miracase_hmub500:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:benda:miracase_hmub500:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:benda:miracase_hmub500_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
