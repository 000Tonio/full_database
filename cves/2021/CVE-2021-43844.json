XML Routing Detour Attacks are Man in the Middle type attacks. The attacker compromises or inserts an intermediate system in the processing of the XML message. For example, WS-Routing can be used to specify a series of nodes or intermediaries through which content is passed. If any of the intermediate nodes in this route are compromised by an attacker they could be used for a routing detour attack. From the compromised system the attacker is able to route the XML process to other nodes of his or her choice and modify the responses so that the normal chain of processing is unaware of the interception. This system can forward the message to an outside entity and hide the forwarding and processing from the legitimate processing systems by altering the header information."}],"cvss":9.3,"cvss-time":"2022-01-04T17:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-610","id":"CVE-2021-43844","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2022-01-04T17:15:00","references":["https://github.com/rcmaehl/MSEdgeRedirect/security/advisories/GHSA-95v4-748v-fmf9","https://github.com/rcmaehl/MSEdgeRedirect/releases/tag/0.5.0.1"],"summary":"MSEdgeRedirect is a tool to redirect news, search, widgets, weather, and more to a user's default browser. MSEdgeRedirect versions before 0.5.0.1 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via specifically crafted URLs. This vulnerability requires user interaction and the acceptance of a prompt. With how MSEdgeRedirect is coded, parameters are impossible to pass to any launched file. However, there are two possible scenarios in which an attacker can do more than a minor annoyance. In Scenario 1 (confirmed), a user visits an attacker controlled webpage; the user is prompted with, and downloads, an executable payload; the user is prompted with, and accepts, the aforementioned crafted URL prompt; and RCE executes the payload the user previously downloaded, if the download path is successfully guessed. In Scenario 2 (not yet confirmed), a user visits an attacked controlled webpage; the user is prompted with, and accepts, the aforementioned crafted URL prompt; and a payload on a remote, attacker controlled, SMB server is executed. The issue was found in the _DecodeAndRun() function, in which I incorrectly assumed _WinAPI_UrlIs() would only accept web resources. Unfortunately, file:/// passes the default _WinAPI_UrlIs check(). File paths are now directly checked for and must fail. There is no currently known exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild. A patched version, 0.5.0.1, has been released that checks for and denies these crafted URLs. There are no workarounds for this issue. Users are advised not to accept any unexpected prompts from web pages.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:msedgeredirect_project:msedgeredirect:0.1.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:msedgeredirect_project:msedgeredirect:0.1.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:msedgeredirect_project:msedgeredirect:0.2.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:msedgeredirect_project:msedgeredirect:0.2.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:msedgeredirect_project:msedgeredirect:0.3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:msedgeredirect_project:msedgeredirect:0.3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:msedgeredirect_project:msedgeredirect:0.4.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:msedgeredirect_project:msedgeredirect:0.4.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:msedgeredirect_project:msedgeredirect:0.4.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:msedgeredirect_project:msedgeredirect:0.4.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:msedgeredirect_project:msedgeredirect:0.5.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:msedgeredirect_project:msedgeredirect:0.5.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:msedgeredirect_project:msedgeredirect:0.1.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:msedgeredirect_project:msedgeredirect:0.2.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:msedgeredirect_project:msedgeredirect:0.3.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:msedgeredirect_project:msedgeredirect:0.4.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:msedgeredirect_project:msedgeredirect:0.4.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:msedgeredirect_project:msedgeredirect:0.5.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
