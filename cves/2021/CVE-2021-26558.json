Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2021-11-16T17:43:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-26558","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-11-16T17:43:00","references":["https://lists.apache.org/thread/4gzkm1zb6c97v9gl8lcz8ll5xr8o484c","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/11/11/1"],"summary":"Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability of Apache ShardingSphere-UI allows an attacker to inject outer link resources.
