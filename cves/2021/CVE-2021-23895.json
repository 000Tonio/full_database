Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":9,"cvss-time":"2021-06-11T13:34:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-23895","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2021-06-11T13:34:00","references":["https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10359"],"summary":"Deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability in McAfee Database Security (DBSec) prior to 4.8.2 allows a remote authenticated attacker to create a reverse shell with administrator privileges on the DBSec server via carefully constructed Java serialized object sent to the DBSec server.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:database_security:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:database_security:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:database_security:4.6.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:database_security:4.6.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:database_security:4.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:database_security:4.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:database_security:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:database_security:4.6.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:database_security:4.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
