If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2022-04-05T23:59:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-33208","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-04-05T23:59:00","references":["https://github.com/blackarrowsec/advisories/tree/master/2021/CVE-2021-33208","https://www.softwareag.com/corporate/products/az/mashzone_nextgen/default"],"summary":"The \"Register an Ehcache Configuration File\" admin feature in MashZone NextGen through 10.7 GA allows XXE attacks via a malicious XML configuration file.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:softwareag:mashzone_nextgen:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:softwareag:mashzone_nextgen:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:softwareag:mashzone_nextgen:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
