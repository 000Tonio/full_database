A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2021-10-25T14:38:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2021-0298","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-10-25T14:38:00","references":["https://kb.juniper.net/JSA11212"],"summary":"A Race Condition in the 'show chassis pic' command in Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved may allow an attacker to crash the port interface concentrator daemon (picd) process on the FPC, if the command is executed coincident with other system events outside the attacker's control, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
