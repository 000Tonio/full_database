The default security setting must be to deny access and then grant access only to those resources intended by business logic.","summary":"In applications, particularly web applications, access to functionality is mitigated by an authorization framework. This framework maps Access Control Lists (ACLs) to elements of the application's functionality; particularly URL's for web apps. In the case that the administrator failed to specify an ACL for a particular element, an attacker may be able to access it with impunity. An attacker with the ability to access functionality not properly constrained by ACLs can obtain sensitive information and possibly compromise the entire application. Such an attacker can access resources that must be available only to users at a higher privilege level, can access management sections of the application, or can run queries for data that they otherwise not supposed to."}],"cvss":9.3,"cvss-time":"2021-08-17T18:46:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-434","id":"CVE-2021-38305","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2021-08-17T18:46:00","references":["https://github.com/23andMe/Yamale/releases/tag/3.0.8","https://github.com/23andMe/Yamale/pull/165"],"summary":"23andMe Yamale before 3.0.8 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted schema file. The schema parser uses eval as part of its processing, and tries to protect from malicious expressions by limiting the builtins that are passed to the eval. When processing the schema, each line is run through Python's eval function to make the validator available. A well-constructed string within the schema rules can execute system commands; thus, by exploiting the vulnerability, an attacker can run arbitrary code on the image that invokes Yamale.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:23andme:yamale:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:23andme:yamale:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:23andme:yamale:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
