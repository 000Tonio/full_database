Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2021-02-26T13:07:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-27335","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-02-26T13:07:00","references":["https://hacked0x90.net/index.php/2021/02/15/kollectapp-insecure-java-deserialization/"],"summary":"KollectApps before 4.8.16c is affected by insecure Java deserialization, leading to Remote Code Execution via a ysoserial.payloads.CommonsCollections parameter.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:kollectapp:kollect:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:kollectapp:kollect:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:kollectapp:kollect:4.8.16:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:kollectapp:kollect:4.8.16:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:kollectapp:kollect:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:kollectapp:kollect:4.8.16:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
