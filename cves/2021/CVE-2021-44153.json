When editing the license file, it is possible for an admin user to enable an option to run arbitrary executables, as demonstrated by an ISV demo \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\calc.exe\" entry. An attacker can exploit this to run a malicious binary on startup, or when triggering the Reread/Restart Servers function on the webserver. (Exploitation does not require CVE-2018-15573, because the license file is meant to be changed in the application.)","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:reprisesoftware:reprise_license_manager:14.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:reprisesoftware:reprise_license_manager:14.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:reprisesoftware:reprise_license_manager:14.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
