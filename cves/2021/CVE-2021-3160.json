Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2021-02-04T18:17:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-3160","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-02-04T18:17:00","references":["https://www.aca.fr/solution/assurex-solution-gestion-des-contrats-assurance/","https://www.digital.security/fr/sites/default/files/advisories/cert-ds_advisory_cve-2021-3160.txt"],"summary":"Deserialization of untrusted data in the login page of ASSUWEB 359.3 build 1 subcomponent of ACA ASSUREX RENTES product allows a remote attacker to inject unsecure serialized Java object using a specially crafted HTTP request, resulting in an unauthenticated remote code execution on the server.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:aca:assuweb:359.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:aca:assuweb:359.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:aca:assuweb:359.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
