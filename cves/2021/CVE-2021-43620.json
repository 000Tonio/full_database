Security-relevant validation of filename extensions is plausibly affected. Methods of NSString for conversion to a string may return a partial result. Because they call CStr::from_ptr on a pointer to the string buffer, the string is terminated at the first '\\0' byte, which might not be the end of the string.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:fruity_project:fruity:0.1.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:fruity_project:fruity:0.1.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:fruity_project:fruity:0.2.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:fruity_project:fruity:0.2.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:fruity_project:fruity:0.1.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:fruity_project:fruity:0.2.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"]}
