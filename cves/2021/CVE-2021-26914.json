Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":9.3,"cvss-time":"2021-05-21T16:52:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-26914","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2021-05-21T16:52:00","references":["https://www.netmotionsoftware.com/security-advisories/security-vulnerability-in-mobility-web-server-november-19-2020","https://ssd-disclosure.com/ssd-advisory-netmotion-mobility-server-multiple-deserialization-of-untrusted-data-lead-to-rce/","https://ssd-disclosure.com/?p=4676","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162617/NetMotion-Mobility-Server-MvcUtil-Java-Deserialization.html"],"summary":"NetMotion Mobility before 11.73 and 12.x before 12.02 allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code as SYSTEM because of Java deserialization in MvcUtil valueStringToObject.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:netmotionsoftware:netmotion_mobility:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:netmotionsoftware:netmotion_mobility:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:netmotionsoftware:netmotion_mobility:12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:netmotionsoftware:netmotion_mobility:12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:netmotionsoftware:netmotion_mobility:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:netmotionsoftware:netmotion_mobility:12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
