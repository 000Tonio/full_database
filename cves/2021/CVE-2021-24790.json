The delete_cf7_data would lead to arbitrary metadata deletion, as well as PHP Object Injection if a suitable gadget chain is present in another plugin, as user data is passed to the maybe_unserialize() function without being first validated.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:contact_form_advanced_database_project:contact_form_advanced_database:-:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:contact_form_advanced_database_project:contact_form_advanced_database:-:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:contact_form_advanced_database_project:contact_form_advanced_database:1.0.8:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:contact_form_advanced_database_project:contact_form_advanced_database:1.0.8:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:contact_form_advanced_database_project:contact_form_advanced_database:-:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:contact_form_advanced_database_project:contact_form_advanced_database:1.0.8:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"]}
