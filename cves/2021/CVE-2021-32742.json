Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.4,"cvss-time":"2021-07-22T12:54:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-32742","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-07-22T12:54:00","references":["https://github.com/vapor/vapor/security/advisories/GHSA-pqwh-c2f3-vxmq","https://github.com/vapor/vapor/releases/tag/4.47.2"],"summary":"Vapor is a web framework for Swift. In versions 4.47.1 and prior, bug in the `Data.init(base32Encoded:)` function opens up the potential for exposing server memory and/or crashing the server (Denial of Service) for applications where untrusted data can end up in said function. Vapor does not currently use this function itself so this only impact applications that use the impacted function directly or through other dependencies. The vulnerability is patched in version 4.47.2. As a workaround, one may use an alternative to Vapor's built-in `Data.init(base32Encoded:)`.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:vapor_project:vapor:4.29.4:*:*:*:*:swift:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:vapor_project:vapor:4.29.4:*:*:*:*:swift:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:vapor_project:vapor:4.29.4:*:*:*:*:swift:*:*"]}
