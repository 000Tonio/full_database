An attacker modifies a known path on the target in order to reach material that is not available through intended channels. These attacks normally involve adding additional path separators (/ or \\) and/or dots (.), or encodings thereof, in various combinations in order to reach parent directories or entirely separate trees of the target's directory structure."}],"cvss":6,"cvss-time":"2022-05-19T17:06:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-23","id":"CVE-2021-34605","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-05-19T17:06:00","references":["https://claroty.com/2022/05/11/blog-research-from-project-file-to-code-execution-exploiting-vulnerabilities-in-xinje-plc-program-tool/"],"summary":"A zip slip vulnerability in XINJE XD/E Series PLC Program Tool up to version v3.5.1 can provide an attacker with arbitrary file write privilege when opening a specially-crafted project file.
