Additionally, writing malicious data to log files may target jobs, filters, reports, and other agents that process the logs in an asynchronous attack pattern. This pattern of attack is similar to \"Log Injection-Tampering-Forging\" except that in this case, the attack is targeting the logs of the web server and not the application."},{"id":"93","name":"Log Injection-Tampering-Forging","prerequisites":"The target host is logging the action and data of the user.

The attacker injects, manipulates or forges malicious log entries in the log file, allowing him to mislead a log audit, cover traces of attack, or perform other malicious actions.

As a result tainted data is resulting in the log files leading to a failure in accountability, non-repudiation and incident forensics capability."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2023-01-19T02:58:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-75","id":"CVE-2021-39174","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2023-01-19T02:58:00","references":["https://github.com/fiveai/Cachet/releases/tag/v2.5.1","https://github.com/fiveai/Cachet/security/advisories/GHSA-88f9-7xxh-c688","https://blog.sonarsource.com/cachet-code-execution-via-laravel-configuration-injection/"],"summary":"Cachet is an open source status page system. Prior to version 2.5.1, authenticated users, regardless of their privileges (User or Admin), can leak the value of any configuration entry of the dotenv file, e.g. the application secret (`APP_KEY`) and various passwords (email, database, etc). This issue was addressed in version 2.5.1 by improving `UpdateConfigCommandHandler` and preventing the use of nested variables in the resulting dotenv configuration file.
