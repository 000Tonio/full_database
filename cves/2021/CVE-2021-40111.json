This can be used for a Denial Of Service attack. The IMAP user needs to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability. This affected Apache James prior to version 3.6.1. This vulnerability had been patched in Apache James 3.6.1 and higher. We recommend the upgrade.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:james:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:james:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:james:2.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:james:2.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:apache:james:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:apache:james:2.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
