If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5.5,"cvss-time":"2021-05-14T20:47:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-1530","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-05-14T20:47:00","references":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-bwms-xxe-uSLrZgKs"],"summary":"A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco BroadWorks Messaging Server Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information or cause a partial denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML file that contains references to external entities. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to retrieve files from the local system, resulting in the disclosure of sensitive information, or cause the application to consume available resources, resulting in a partial DoS condition on an affected system. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:broadworks_messaging_server:22.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:broadworks_messaging_server:22.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:cisco:broadworks_messaging_server:22.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
