When user clicks on a specially crafted a malicious URL, if user does not carefully pay attention to url, user may be tricked to think content may be coming from a valid domain, while it comes from another. This is performed by using a very long username part of the url so that user cannot see the domain name. A remote attacker can leverage this to perform url address bar spoofing attack. The fix is, browser no longer shows the user name part in address bar.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:f-secure:safe:-:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:f-secure:safe:-:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:f-secure:safe:17.7.260301:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:f-secure:safe:17.7.260301:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:f-secure:safe:17.8.264411:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:f-secure:safe:17.8.264411:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:f-secure:safe:-:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:f-secure:safe:17.7.260301:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:f-secure:safe:17.8.264411:*:*:*:*:iphone_os:*:*"]}
