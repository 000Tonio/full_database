A user without the user-management privilege can change another user's email address if the attacker knows details of the victim such as the exact roles and group roles, ID, and remote authentication ID settings. These must be sent in a modified save API request. It was fixed in 6.3.0.03.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:labcup:labcup:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:labcup:labcup:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:labcup:labcup:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
