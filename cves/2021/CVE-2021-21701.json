If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2021-11-17T01:18:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-21701","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-11-17T01:18:00","references":["https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2021-11-12/#SECURITY-2394","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/11/12/1","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-21-1313/"],"summary":"Jenkins Performance Plugin 3.20 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:performance:3.20:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:performance:3.20:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:performance:3.20:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*"]}
