Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.2,"cvss-time":"2021-12-17T17:48:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-0970","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2021-12-17T17:48:00","references":["https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2021-12-01"],"summary":"In createFromParcel of GpsNavigationMessage.java, there is a possible Parcel serialization/deserialization mismatch.
