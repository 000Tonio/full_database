This vulnerability is due to improper management of memory resources, referred to as a double free. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted LLDP packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: LLDP is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:video_surveillance_7000_ip_camera_firmware:2.12.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:cisco:video_surveillance_7000_ip_camera_firmware:2.12.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:cisco:video_surveillance_7000_ip_camera_firmware:2.12.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
