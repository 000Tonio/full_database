A potential heap buffer overflow exists in the code that parses the HTTP POST request, due to an incorrect signed integer comparison. This vulnerability requires the attacker to send a malformed HTTP packet with a negative Content-Length, which bypasses the size checks and results in a large heap overflow in the wbs_multidata buffer copy.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:hcc-embedded:nichestack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:hcc-embedded:nichestack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:hcc-embedded:nichestack:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
