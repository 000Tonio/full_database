Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2021-03-10T13:49:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-20076","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-03-10T13:49:00","references":["https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-03"],"summary":"Tenable.sc and Tenable.sc Core versions 5.13.0 through 5.17.0 were found to contain a vulnerability that could allow an authenticated, unprivileged user to perform Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Tenable.sc server via Hypertext Preprocessor unserialization.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:tenable:tenable.sc:5.14.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:tenable:tenable.sc:5.14.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:tenable:tenable.sc:5.14.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:tenable:tenable.sc:5.14.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:tenable:tenable.sc:5.17.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:tenable:tenable.sc:5.17.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:tenable:tenable.sc:5.14.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:tenable:tenable.sc:5.14.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:tenable:tenable.sc:5.17.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
