If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":3.6,"cvss-time":"2021-01-14T16:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-21470","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-01-14T16:15:00","references":["https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3000291","https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=564760476"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3000291","https://wiki.scn.sap.com/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=564760476"]},"summary":"SAP EPM Add-in for Microsoft Office, version - 1010 and SAP EPM Add-in for SAP Analysis Office, version - 2.8, allows an authenticated attacker with user privileges to parse malicious XML files which could result in XXE-based attacks in applications that accept attacker-controlled XML configuration files.
