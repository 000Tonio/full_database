If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2021-03-25T01:53:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-28110","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-03-25T01:53:00","references":["https://gist.github.com/kukuxumushi/0b7d90a917ac3480066c4cbf7519b40a"],"summary":"/exec in TranzWare e-Commerce Payment Gateway (TWEC PG) before 3.1.27.5 had a vulnerability in its XML parser.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:compassplus:tranzware_e-commerce_payment_gateway:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:compassplus:tranzware_e-commerce_payment_gateway:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:compassplus:tranzware_e-commerce_payment_gateway:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
