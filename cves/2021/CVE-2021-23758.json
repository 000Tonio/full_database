Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2021-12-06T20:06:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-23758","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-12-06T20:06:00","references":["https://github.com/michaelschwarz/Ajax.NET-Professional/commit/b0e63be5f0bb20dfce507cb8a1a9568f6e73de57","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-DOTNET-AJAXPRO2-1925971"],"summary":"All versions of package ajaxpro.2 are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data due to the possibility of deserialization of arbitrary .NET classes, which can be abused to gain remote code execution.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ajaxpro.2_project:ajaxpro.2:*:*:*:*:*:.net:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ajaxpro.2_project:ajaxpro.2:*:*:*:*:*:.net:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:ajaxpro.2_project:ajaxpro.2:*:*:*:*:*:.net:*:*"]}
