Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":4.6,"cvss-time":"2021-10-28T19:16:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-35227","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-10-28T19:16:00","references":["https://www.solarwinds.com/trust-center/security-advisories/cve-2021-35227","https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/success_center/arm/content/release_notes/arm_2021-4_release_notes.htm"],"summary":"The HTTP interface was enabled for RabbitMQ Plugin in ARM 2020.2.6 and the ability to configure HTTPS was not available.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:solarwinds:access_rights_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:solarwinds:access_rights_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:solarwinds:access_rights_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
