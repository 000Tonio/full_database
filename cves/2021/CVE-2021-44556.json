If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.4,"cvss-time":"2021-12-13T19:24:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-44556","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-12-13T19:24:00","references":["https://github.com/KBNLresearch/digger","https://github.com/KBNLresearch/digger/pull/1"],"summary":"National Library of the Netherlands digger < 6697d1269d981e35e11f240725b16401b5ce3db5 is affected by a XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability.
