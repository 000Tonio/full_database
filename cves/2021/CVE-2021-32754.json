If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":3.5,"cvss-time":"2021-07-15T16:31:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-32754","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-07-15T16:31:00","references":["https://github.com/secure-software-engineering/FlowDroid/security/advisories/GHSA-39r7-275f-rvgw"],"summary":"FlowDroid is a data flow analysis tool. FlowDroid versions prior to 2.9.0 contained an XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability that allowed an attacker who had control over the source/sink definition file in XML format to read files from external locations. In order for this to occur, the XML-based format for sources and sinks had to be used and the attacker had to able control the source/sink definition file. The vulnerability was patched in version 2.9.0. As a workaround, do not allow untrusted entities to control the source/sink definition file.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:flowdroid_project:flowdroid:2.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:flowdroid_project:flowdroid:2.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:flowdroid_project:flowdroid:2.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:flowdroid_project:flowdroid:2.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:flowdroid_project:flowdroid:2.6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:flowdroid_project:flowdroid:2.6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:flowdroid_project:flowdroid:2.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:flowdroid_project:flowdroid:2.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:flowdroid_project:flowdroid:2.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:flowdroid_project:flowdroid:2.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:flowdroid_project:flowdroid:2.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:flowdroid_project:flowdroid:2.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:flowdroid_project:flowdroid:2.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:flowdroid_project:flowdroid:2.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:flowdroid_project:flowdroid:2.6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:flowdroid_project:flowdroid:2.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:flowdroid_project:flowdroid:2.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:flowdroid_project:flowdroid:2.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
