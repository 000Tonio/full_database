Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2021-05-27T22:37:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-32634","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-05-27T22:37:00","references":["https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/emissary/security/advisories/GHSA-m5qf-gfmp-7638","https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/emissary/commit/40260b1ec1f76cc92361702cc14fa1e4388e19d7"],"summary":"Emissary is a distributed, peer-to-peer, data-driven workflow framework.
