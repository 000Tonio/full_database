An attacker modifies a known path on the target in order to reach material that is not available through intended channels. These attacks normally involve adding additional path separators (/ or \\) and/or dots (.), or encodings thereof, in various combinations in order to reach parent directories or entirely separate trees of the target's directory structure."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2022-06-07T20:57:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-23","id":"CVE-2021-32964","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-06-07T20:57:00","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-21-161-02"],"summary":"The AGG Software Web Server version 4.0.40.1014 and prior is vulnerable to a path traversal attack, which may allow an attacker to read arbitrary files from the file system.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:aggsoft:webserver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:aggsoft:webserver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:aggsoft:webserver:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
