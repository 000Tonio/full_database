If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2021-03-04T16:05:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-26703","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-03-04T16:05:00","references":["https://files.eprints.org/2548/","https://files.eprints.org/2549/","https://github.com/grymer/CVE/blob/master/eprints_security_review.pdf"],"summary":"EPrints 3.4.2 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files and possibly execute commands via crafted JSON/XML input to a cgi/ajax/phrase URI.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:eprints:eprints:3.4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:eprints:eprints:3.4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:eprints:eprints:3.4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
