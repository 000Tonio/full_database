Prior to versions 3.4.5 and 3.3.15, an authenticated user with authorization to read webhooks in one project can craft a request to reveal Webhook definitions and tokens in another project. The user could use the revealed webhook tokens to trigger webhooks. Severity depends on trust level of authenticated users and whether any webhooks exist that trigger sensitive actions. There are patches for this vulnerability in versions 3.4.5 and 3.3.15. There are currently no known workarounds.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:pagerduty:rundeck:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:pagerduty:rundeck:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:pagerduty:rundeck:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*"]}
