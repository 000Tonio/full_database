We assume that the Raspberry Pi supplies power to some speakers. The power indicator LED of the Raspberry Pi is connected directly to the power line, as a result, the intensity of a device's power indicator LED is correlative to the power consumption. The sound played by the speakers affects the Raspberry Pi's power consumption and as a result is also correlative to the light intensity of the LED. By analyzing measurements obtained from an electro-optical sensor directed at the power indicator LED of the Raspberry Pi, we can recover the sound played by the speakers.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:raspberrypi:raspberry_pi_4_model_b_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:raspberrypi:raspberry_pi_4_model_b_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:raspberrypi:raspberry_pi_4_model_b:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:raspberrypi:raspberry_pi_4_model_b:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:raspberrypi:raspberry_pi_3_model_b\\+_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:raspberrypi:raspberry_pi_3_model_b\\+_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:raspberrypi:raspberry_pi_3_model_b\\+:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:raspberrypi:raspberry_pi_3_model_b\\+:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:raspberrypi:raspberry_pi_4_model_b_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:raspberrypi:raspberry_pi_3_model_b\\+_firmware:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
