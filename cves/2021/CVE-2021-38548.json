The power indicator LED of the speakers is connected directly to the power line, as a result, the intensity of a device's power indicator LED is correlative to the power consumption. The sound played by the speakers affects their power consumption and as a result is also correlative to the light intensity of the LEDs. By analyzing measurements obtained from an electro-optical sensor directed at the power indicator LEDs of the speakers, we can recover the sound played by them.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:jbl:go_2_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:jbl:go_2_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:jbl:go_2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:jbl:go_2:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:jbl:go_2_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
