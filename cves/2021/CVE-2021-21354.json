An attacker can redirect anyone to malicious sites. To Reproduce type in this URL: \"https://pollbot.services.mozilla.com//evil.com/\". Affected versions will redirect to that website when you inject a payload like \"//evil.com/\". This is fixed in version 1.4.4.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mozilla:pollbot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mozilla:pollbot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:mozilla:pollbot:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
