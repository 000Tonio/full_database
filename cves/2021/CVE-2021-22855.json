Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2021-02-24T18:30:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-22855","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-02-24T18:30:00","references":["https://www.chtsecurity.com/news/d334641f-2b28-4eab-a5ed-c6ec6740557e","https://www.twcert.org.tw/tw/cp-132-4405-2ddde-1.html"],"summary":"The specific function of HR Portal of Soar Cloud System accepts any type of object to be deserialized.
