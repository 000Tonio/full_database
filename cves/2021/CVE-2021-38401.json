This can result in the crashing of the application or, for certain pointer values, access to data that would not normally be possible or the execution of arbitrary code. Since pointers are simply integer variables, Integer Attacks may often be used in Pointer Attacks."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-822","id":"CVE-2021-38401","impact":{},"last-modified":"2021-12-21T02:10:00","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-21-299-01"],"summary":"Fuji Electric V-Server Lite and Tellus Lite V-Simulator prior to v4.0.12.0 is vulnerable to an untrusted pointer dereference, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code and cause the application to crash.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
