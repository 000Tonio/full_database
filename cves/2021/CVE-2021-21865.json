Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2022-09-03T03:27:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-21865","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-09-03T03:27:00","references":["https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2021-1301","https://customers.codesys.com/index.php?eID=dumpFile&t=f&f=16805&token=ee583c498941d9fda86490bca98ff21928eec08a&download="],"summary":"A unsafe deserialization vulnerability exists in the PackageManagement.plugin ExtensionMethods.Clone() functionality of CODESYS GmbH CODESYS Development System 3.5.16.
