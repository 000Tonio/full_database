If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2022-06-13T12:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-45981","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-06-13T12:15:00","references":["https://www.netscout.com/securityadvisories","https://netscout.com"],"summary":"NetScout nGeniusONE 6.3.2 allows an XML External Entity (XXE) attack.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:netscout:ngeniusone:6.3.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:netscout:ngeniusone:6.3.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:netscout:ngeniusone:6.3.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
