Use methods that limit entity expansion and throw exceptions on attempted entity expansion. Implementation: Disable altogether the use of inline DTD schemas in your XML parsing objects.

XML allows the definition of macro-like structures that can be used to simplify the creation of complex structures. However, this capability can be abused to create excessive demands on a processor's CPU and memory. A small number of nested expansions can result in an exponential growth in demands on memory."},{"id":"492","name":"Regular Expression Exponential Blowup","prerequisites":"This type of an attack requires the ability to identify hosts running a poorly implemented Regex, and the ability to send crafted input to exploit the regular expression.","related_weakness":["400"],"solutions":"Test custom written Regex with fuzzing to determine if the Regex is a poor one. Add timeouts to processes that handle the Regex logic. If an evil Regex is found rewrite it as a good Regex.","summary":"An adversary may execute an attack on a program that uses a poor Regular Expression(Regex) implementation by choosing input that results in an extreme situation for the Regex. A typical extreme situation operates at exponential time compared to the input size. This is due to most implementations using a Nondeterministic Finite Automaton(NFA) state machine to be built by the Regex algorithm since NFA allows backtracking and thus more complex regular expressions. The algorithm builds a finite state machine and based on the input transitions through all the states until the end of the input is reached. NFA engines may evaluate each character in the input string multiple times during the backtracking. The algorithm tries each path through the NFA one by one until a match is found; the malicious input is crafted so every path is tried which results in a failure. Exploitation of the Regex results in programs hanging or taking a very long time to complete. These attacks may target various layers of the Internet due to regular expressions being used in validation."},{"id":"147","name":"XML Ping of the Death","prerequisites":"The target must receive and process XML transactions.","related_weakness":["400","770"],"solutions":"Design: Build throttling mechanism into the resource allocation.

Implementation: Provide for network flow control and traffic shaping to control access to the resources.","summary":"An attacker initiates a resource depletion attack where a large number of small XML messages are delivered at a sufficiently rapid rate to cause a denial of service or crash of the target. Transactions such as repetitive SOAP transactions can deplete resources faster than a simple flooding attack because of the additional resources used by the SOAP protocol and the resources necessary to process SOAP messages. The transactions used are immaterial as long as they cause resource utilization on the target. In other words, this is a normal flooding attack augmented by using messages that will require extra processing on the target."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2021-02-08T21:23:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-400","id":"CVE-2021-21271","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-02-08T21:23:00","references":["https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/v0.34.3/CHANGELOG.md#v0.34.3","https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/commit/a2a6852ab99e4a0f9e79f0ea8c1726e262e25c76","https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/security/advisories/GHSA-p658-8693-mhvg"],"summary":"Tendermint Core is an open source Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a state transition machine - written in any programming language - and securely replicates it on many machines. Tendermint Core v0.34.0 introduced a new way of handling evidence of misbehavior. As part of this, we added a new Timestamp field to Evidence structs. This timestamp would be calculated using the same algorithm that is used when a block is created and proposed. (This algorithm relies on the timestamp of the last commit from this specific block.) In Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2, the consensus reactor is responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence whenever double signs are observed. However, the current block is still “in flight” when it is being formed by the consensus reactor. It hasn’t been finalized through network consensus yet. This means that different nodes in the network may observe different “last commits” when assigning a timestamp to DuplicateVoteEvidence. In turn, different nodes could form DuplicateVoteEvidence objects at the same height but with different timestamps. One DuplicateVoteEvidence object (with one timestamp) will then eventually get finalized in the block, but this means that any DuplicateVoteEvidence with a different timestamp is considered invalid. Any node that formed invalid DuplicateVoteEvidence will continue to propose invalid evidence; its peers may see this, and choose to disconnect from this node. This bug means that double signs are DoS vectors in Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2. Tendermint Core v0.34.3 is a security release which fixes this bug. As of v0.34.3, DuplicateVoteEvidence is no longer formed by the consensus reactor; rather, the consensus reactor passes the Votes themselves into the EvidencePool, which is now responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence. The EvidencePool has timestamp info that should be consistent across the network, which means that DuplicateVoteEvidence formed in this reactor should have consistent timestamps. This release changes the API between the consensus and evidence reactors.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.0:rc3:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.0:rc3:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.0:rc4:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.0:rc4:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.0:rc5:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.0:rc5:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.0:rc6:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.0:rc6:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.1:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.1:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.1:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.1:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.0:rc3:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.0:rc4:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.0:rc5:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.0:rc6:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.1:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.1:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:tendermint:tendermint:0.34.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
