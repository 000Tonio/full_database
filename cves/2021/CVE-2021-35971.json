Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2021-07-06T17:51:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-35971","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-07-06T17:51:00","references":["https://www.veeam.com/kb4180","https://www.veeam.com/kb4126"],"summary":"Veeam Backup and Replication 10 before 10.0.1.4854 P20210609 and 11 before 11.0.0.837 P20210507 mishandles deserialization during Microsoft .NET remoting.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:veeam:veeam_backup_\\&_replication:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:veeam:veeam_backup_\\&_replication:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:veeam:veeam_backup_\\&_replication:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:veeam:veeam_backup_\\&_replication:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:veeam:veeam_backup_\\&_replication:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:veeam:veeam_backup_\\&_replication:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
