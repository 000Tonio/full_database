If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2021-11-17T01:17:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-43576","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-11-17T01:17:00","references":["https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2021-11-12/#SECURITY-2415","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/11/12/1","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-21-1314/"],"summary":"Jenkins pom2config Plugin 1.2 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks, allowing attackers with Overall/Read and Item/Read permissions to have Jenkins parse a crafted XML file that uses external entities for extraction of secrets from the Jenkins controller or server-side request forgery.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:pom2config:1.2:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:pom2config:1.2:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:pom2config:1.2:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*"]}
