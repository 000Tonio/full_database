Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2021-07-22T13:22:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-34520","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-07-22T13:22:00","references":["https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2021-34520","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-21-828/"],"summary":"Microsoft SharePoint Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2021-34467, CVE-2021-34468.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:sharepoint_foundation:2013:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:sharepoint_foundation:2013:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:sharepoint_server:2016:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:sharepoint_server:2016:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:sharepoint_server:2019:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:sharepoint_server:2019:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:sharepoint_foundation:2013:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:sharepoint_server:2016:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:sharepoint_server:2019:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
