If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2021-09-14T13:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-34436","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-09-14T13:15:00","references":["https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=563174"],"summary":"In Eclipse Theia 0.1.1 to 0.2.0, it is possible to exploit the default build to obtain remote code execution (and XXE) via the theia-xml-extension.
