If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2022-01-15T02:52:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-42560","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-01-15T02:52:00","references":["https://github.com/mitre/caldera/releases","https://github.com/DrunkenShells/Disclosures/tree/master/CVE-2021-42560-Unsafe%20XML%20Parsing-MITRE%20Caldera"],"summary":"An issue was discovered in CALDERA 2.9.0.
