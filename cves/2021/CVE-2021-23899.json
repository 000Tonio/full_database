If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2021-01-19T18:45:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-23899","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-01-19T18:45:00","references":["https://github.com/OWASP/json-sanitizer/commit/a37f594f7378a1c76b3283e0dab9e1ab1dc0247e","https://github.com/OWASP/json-sanitizer/compare/v1.2.1...v1.2.2","https://groups.google.com/g/json-sanitizer-support/c/dAW1AeNMoA0"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://github.com/OWASP/json-sanitizer/commit/a37f594f7378a1c76b3283e0dab9e1ab1dc0247e","https://github.com/OWASP/json-sanitizer/compare/v1.2.1...v1.2.2","https://groups.google.com/g/json-sanitizer-support/c/dAW1AeNMoA0"]},"summary":"OWASP json-sanitizer before 1.2.2 may emit closing SCRIPT tags and CDATA section delimiters for crafted input.
