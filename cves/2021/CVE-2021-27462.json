Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2022-03-29T18:19:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-27462","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-03-29T18:19:00","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-21-091-01","https://idp.rockwellautomation.com/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx?RelayState=RPID%3Drockwellautomation.custhelp.com%26RelayState%3Danswers%2Fanswer_view%2Fa_id%2F1130831"],"summary":"A deserialization vulnerability exists in how the AosService.rem service in Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk AssetCentre v10.00 and earlier verifies serialized data.
