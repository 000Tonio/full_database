Tainted data from the attacker is used and copied to temporary files. The target host does insecure temporary file creation.","related_weakness":["367","61","662","667","689"],"solutions":"Use safe libraries when creating temporary files. For instance the standard library function mkstemp can be used to safely create temporary files. For shell scripts, the system utility mktemp does the same thing. Access to the directories should be restricted as to prevent attackers from manipulating the files. Denying access to a file can prevent an attacker from replacing that file with a link to a sensitive file. Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning access rights to files. Ensure good compartmentalization in the system to provide protected areas that can be trusted.","summary":"This attack leverages the use of symbolic links (Symlinks) in order to write to sensitive files. An attacker can create a Symlink link to a target file not otherwise accessible to her. When the privileged program tries to create a temporary file with the same name as the Symlink link, it will actually write to the target file pointed to by the attackers' Symlink link. If the attacker can insert malicious content in the temporary file she will be writing to the sensitive file by using the Symlink. The race occurs because the system checks if the temporary file exists, then creates the file. The attacker would typically create the Symlink during the interval between the check and the creation of the temporary file."},{"id":"25","name":"Forced Deadlock","prerequisites":"The target host has a deadlock condition. There are four conditions for a deadlock to occur, known as the Coffman conditions.

For competing actions, use well-known libraries which implement synchronization.","summary":"The adversary triggers and exploits a deadlock condition in the target software to cause a denial of service. A deadlock can occur when two or more competing actions are waiting for each other to finish, and thus neither ever does. Deadlock conditions can be difficult to detect."},{"id":"26","name":"Leveraging Race Conditions","prerequisites":"A resource is accessed/modified concurrently by multiple processes such that a race condition exists.

The adversary can leverage a race condition by \"running the race\", modifying the resource and modifying the normal execution flow. For instance, a race condition can occur while accessing a file: the adversary can trick the system by replacing the original file with his version and cause the system to read the malicious file."},{"id":"29","name":"Leveraging Time-of-Check and Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Conditions","prerequisites":"A resource is access/modified concurrently by multiple processes.

A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":2.1,"cvss-time":"2022-02-15T21:10:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-662","id":"CVE-2021-0147","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-02-15T21:10:00","references":["https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00470.html"],"summary":"Improper locking in the Power Management Controller (PMC) for some Intel Chipset firmware before versions pmc_fw_lbg_c1-21ww02a and pmc_fw_lbg_b0-21ww02a may allow a privileged user to potentially enable denial of service via local access.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:intel:power_management_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:intel:power_management_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:intel:power_management_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
