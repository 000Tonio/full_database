If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2021-09-27T18:46:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-39239","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2021-09-27T18:46:00","references":["https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf44d529c54ef1d0097e813f576a0823a727e1669a9f610d3221d493d%40%3Cusers.jena.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rf44d529c54ef1d0097e813f576a0823a727e1669a9f610d3221d493d@%3Cannounce.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rce5241b228a1f0e5880f6b2bfdb7ae9ee420e94cb692738a0bbfed9d@%3Cdev.jena.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r0f03ae7e102c3e8587fdd36531fc167309335738156dfbd7d9c1bf45@%3Cdev.jena.apache.org%3E"],"summary":"A vulnerability in XML processing in Apache Jena, in versions up to 4.1.0, may allow an attacker to execute XML External Entities (XXE), including exposing the contents of local files to a remote server.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:jena:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:apache:jena:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:apache:jena:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
