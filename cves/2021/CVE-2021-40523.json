During negotiation between a server and a client, the server may fail to give the WILL/WONT or DO/DONT response for DO and WILL commands because of improper handling of exception condition, which leads to property violations and denial of service. Specifically, a server sometimes sends no response, because a fixed buffer space is available for all responses and that space may have been exhausted.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:contiki-os:contiki:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:contiki-os:contiki:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:contiki-os:contiki:3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
