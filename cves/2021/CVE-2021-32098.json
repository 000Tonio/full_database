Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2021-05-11T19:56:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-32098","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-05-11T19:56:00","references":["https://blog.sonarsource.com/pandora-fms-742-critical-code-vulnerabilities-explained","https://pandorafms.com/blog/whats-new-in-pandora-fms-743/","https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/multiple-vulnerabilities-in-pandora-fms-could-trigger-remote-execution-attack"],"summary":"Artica Pandora FMS 742 allows unauthenticated attackers to perform Phar deserialization.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:artica:pandora_fms:742:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:artica:pandora_fms:742:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:artica:pandora_fms:742:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
