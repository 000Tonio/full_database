The provided input for ECALL 14 triggers a branch in trustedEcdsaSign that frees a non-initialized pointer from the stack. An attacker can chain multiple enclave calls to prepare a stack that contains a valid address. This address is then freed, resulting in compromised integrity of the enclave. This was resolved after v1.58.3 and not reproducible in sgxwallet v1.77.0.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:skale:sgxwallet:1.58.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:skale:sgxwallet:1.58.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:skale:sgxwallet:1.58.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
