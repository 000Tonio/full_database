Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":4.6,"cvss-time":"2021-10-08T03:30:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-0685","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-10-08T03:30:00","references":["https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2021-09-01"],"summary":"In ParsedIntentInfo of ParsedIntentInfo.java, there is a possible parcel serialization/deserialization mismatch due to unsafe deserialization.
