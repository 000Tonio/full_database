When using the get_post_logout_redirect and get_post_login_redirect functions, it is possible to bypass URL validation and redirect a user to an arbitrary URL by providing multiple back slashes such as \\\\\\evil.com/path. This vulnerability is only exploitable if an alternative WSGI server other than Werkzeug is used, or the default behaviour of Werkzeug is modified using 'autocorrect_location_header=False. **Note:** Flask-Security is not maintained anymore.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:flask-security_project:flask-security:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:flask-security_project:flask-security:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:flask-security_project:flask-security:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
