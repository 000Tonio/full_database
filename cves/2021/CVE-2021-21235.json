In kamadak-exif version 0.5.2, there is an infinite loop in parsing crafted PNG files. Specifically, reader::read_from_container can cause an infinite loop when a crafted PNG file is given. This is fixed in version 0.5.3. No workaround is available. Applications that do not pass files with the PNG signature to Reader::read_from_container are not affected.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:kamadak-exif_project:kamadak-exif:0.5.2:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:kamadak-exif_project:kamadak-exif:0.5.2:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:kamadak-exif_project:kamadak-exif:0.5.2:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"]}
