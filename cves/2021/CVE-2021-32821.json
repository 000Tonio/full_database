All known versions include a CSS selector parser that is vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). An attack requires that an attacker can inject a string into a CSS selector at runtime, which is quite common with e.g. jQuery CSS selectors. No patches are available for this issue.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mootools:mootools:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mootools:mootools:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:mootools:mootools:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
