This then caused a javascript error on topic pages because we were looking for an `<a>` element inside the footnote reference span and getting its ID, and because it did not exist we got a null reference error in javascript. Users are advised to update to version 0.2. As a workaround editing offending posts from the rails console or the database console for self-hosters, or disabling the plugin in the admin panel can mitigate this issue.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse_footnote:0.1:*:*:*:*:discourse:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse_footnote:0.1:*:*:*:*:discourse:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:discourse:discourse_footnote:0.1:*:*:*:*:discourse:*:*"]}
