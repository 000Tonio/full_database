An 'explicit intent' is delivered to a specific application as declared within the intent, whereas an 'implicit intent' is directed to an application as defined by the Android operating system. If an implicit intent must be used, then it should be assumed that the intent will be received by an unknown application and any response should be treated accordingly (i.e., with appropriate security controls). Never use implicit intents for inter-application communication.","summary":"An adversary intercepts an implicit intent sent to launch a trusted activity and instead launches a counterfeit activity in its place.

In verions 3.7.2 and 3.7.3, Dde to incorrect use of a default URL, `singularity` action commands (`run`/`shell`/`exec`) specifying a container using a `library://` URI will always attempt to retrieve the container from the default remote endpoint (`cloud.sylabs.io`) rather than the configured remote endpoint. An attacker may be able to push a malicious container to the default remote endpoint with a URI that is identical to the URI used by a victim with a non-default remote endpoint, thus executing the malicious container. Only action commands (`run`/`shell`/`exec`) against `library://` URIs are affected. Other commands such as `pull` / `push` respect the configured remote endpoint. The vulnerability is patched in Singularity version 3.7.4. Two possible workarounds exist: Users can only interact with the default remote endpoint, or an installation can have an execution control list configured to restrict execution to containers signed with specific secure keys.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sylabs:singularity:3.7.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sylabs:singularity:3.7.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sylabs:singularity:3.7.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sylabs:singularity:3.7.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sylabs:singularity:3.7.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:sylabs:singularity:3.7.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
