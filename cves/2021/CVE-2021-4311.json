If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-4311","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-01-12T21:50:00","references":["https://github.com/Talend/tmdm-server-se/pull/1420","https://github.com/Talend/tmdm-server-se/commit/31d442b9fb1d518128fd18f6e4d54e06c3d67793","https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.217666","https://vuldb.com/?id.217666"],"summary":"A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in Talend Open Studio for MDM.
