Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2021-02-18T02:14:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-27213","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-02-18T02:14:00","references":["https://github.com/cvandeplas/pystemon/commit/dbeb87afefdb63de2f4cff69b6f10c5965d14b54","https://www.huntr.dev/bounties/1-other-pystemon/"],"summary":"config.py in pystemon before 2021-02-13 allows code execution via YAML deserialization because SafeLoader and safe_load are not used.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:pystemon_project:pystemon:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:pystemon_project:pystemon:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:pystemon_project:pystemon:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
