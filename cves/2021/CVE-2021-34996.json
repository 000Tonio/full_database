Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The specific flaw exists within the Demo_ExecuteProcessOnGroup workflow. By creating a workflow, an attacker can specify an arbitrary command to be executed. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of SYSTEM.
