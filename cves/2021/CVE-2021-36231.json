Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":9,"cvss-time":"2021-09-08T17:38:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-36231","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2021-09-08T17:38:00","references":["https://www.syss.de/fileadmin/dokumente/Publikationen/Advisories/SYSS-2021-035.txt"],"summary":"Deserialization of untrusted data in multiple functions in MIK.starlight 7.9.5.24363 allows authenticated remote attackers to execute operating system commands by crafting serialized objects.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:unit4:mik.starlight:7.9.5.24363:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:unit4:mik.starlight:7.9.5.24363:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:unit4:mik.starlight:7.9.5.24363:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
