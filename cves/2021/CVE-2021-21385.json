Mifos-Mobile before commit e505f62 disables HTTPS hostname verification of its HTTP client. Additionally it accepted any self-signed certificate as valid. Hostname verification is an important part when using HTTPS to ensure that the presented certificate is valid for the host. Disabling it can allow for man-in-the-middle attacks. Accepting any certificate, even self-signed ones allows man-in-the-middle attacks. This problem is fixed in mifos-mobile commit e505f62.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mifos:mifos-mobile:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mifos:mifos-mobile:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:mifos:mifos-mobile:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*"]}
