If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2022-01-03T20:52:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-44028","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-01-03T20:52:00","references":["https://support.quest.com/kace-desktop-authority/kb/336098/quest-response-to-desktop-authority-vulnerabilities-prior-to-11-2"],"summary":"XXE can occur in Quest KACE Desktop Authority before 11.2 because the log4net configuration file might be controlled by an attacker, a related issue to CVE-2018-1285.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:quest:kace_desktop_authority:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:quest:kace_desktop_authority:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:quest:kace_desktop_authority:10.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:quest:kace_desktop_authority:10.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:quest:kace_desktop_authority:10.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:quest:kace_desktop_authority:10.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:quest:kace_desktop_authority:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:quest:kace_desktop_authority:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:quest:kace_desktop_authority:11.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:quest:kace_desktop_authority:11.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:quest:kace_desktop_authority:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:quest:kace_desktop_authority:10.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:quest:kace_desktop_authority:10.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:quest:kace_desktop_authority:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:quest:kace_desktop_authority:11.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
