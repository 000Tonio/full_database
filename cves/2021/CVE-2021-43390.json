The specific issue exists within the parsing of DGN files. Crafted data in a DGN file and lack of proper validation of input data can trigger a write operation past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:opendesign:drawings_software_development_kit:2021.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:opendesign:drawings_software_development_kit:2021.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:opendesign:drawings_software_development_kit:2021.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:opendesign:drawings_software_development_kit:2021.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:opendesign:drawings_software_development_kit:2021.11:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:opendesign:drawings_software_development_kit:2021.12:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
