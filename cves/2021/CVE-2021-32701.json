When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope `foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope, introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope `bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When caching is disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in [`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L152). From [`tokenFromCache()`](https://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb29a4/pipeline/authn/authenticator_oauth2_introspection.go#L97) it seems that it only validates the token expiration date, but ignores whether the token has or not the proper scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.0:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.0:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.1:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.1:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.2:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.2:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.3:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.3:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.4:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.4:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.5:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.5:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.6:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.6:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.7:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.7:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.8:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.8:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.9:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.9:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.10:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.10:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.11:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.11:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.0:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.1:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.2:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.3:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.4:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.5:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.6:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.7:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.8:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.9:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.10:beta2:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ory:oathkeeper:0.38.11:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
