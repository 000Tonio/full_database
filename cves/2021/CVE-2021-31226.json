A potential heap buffer overflow exists in the code that parses the HTTP POST request, due to lack of size validation. This vulnerability requires the attacker to send a crafted HTTP POST request with a URI longer than 50 bytes. This leads to a heap overflow in wbs_post() via an strcpy() call.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:hcc-embedded:interniche:4.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:hcc-embedded:interniche:4.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:hcc-embedded:interniche:4.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
