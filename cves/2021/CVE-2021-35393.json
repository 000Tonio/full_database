The binary is usually named wscd or mini_upnpd and is the successor to miniigd. The server is vulnerable to a stack buffer overflow vulnerability that is present due to unsafe parsing of the UPnP SUBSCRIBE/UNSUBSCRIBE Callback header. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows remote unauthenticated attackers to gain arbitrary code execution on the affected device.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:realtek:realtek_jungle_sdk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:realtek:realtek_jungle_sdk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:realtek:realtek_jungle_sdk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
