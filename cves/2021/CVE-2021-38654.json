Use secure functions not vulnerable to buffer overflow. If you have to use dangerous functions, make sure that you do boundary checking.

As a consequence, an adversary is able to write past the boundaries of allocated buffer regions in memory, causing a program crash or potentially redirection of execution as per the adversaries' choice."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2021-09-24T19:08:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-129","id":"CVE-2021-38654","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-09-24T19:08:00","references":["https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2021-38654","https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-21-1081/"],"summary":"Microsoft Office Visio Remote Code Execution Vulnerability This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2021-38653.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:365_apps:-:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:365_apps:-:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:office:2019:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:office:2019:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:365_apps:-:*:*:*:enterprise:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:office:2019:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
