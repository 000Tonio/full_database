In particular, the desired behavior (if .travis.yml has been created locally by a customer, and added to git) is for a Travis service to perform builds in a way that prevents public access to customer-specific secret environment data such as signing keys, access credentials, and API tokens. However, during the stated 8-day interval, secret data could be revealed to an unauthorized actor who forked a public repository and printed files during a build process.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:travis-ci:travis_ci:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:travis-ci:travis_ci:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:travis-ci:travis_ci:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
