Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2021-05-17T19:11:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-24280","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-05-17T19:11:00","references":["https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/db4ba6b0-887e-4ec1-8935-ab21d369b329","https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2021/04/severe-vulnerabilities-patched-in-redirection-for-contact-form-7-plugin/"],"summary":"In the Redirection for Contact Form 7 WordPress plugin before 2.3.4, any authenticated user, such as a subscriber, could use the import_from_debug AJAX action to inject PHP objects.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:querysol:redirection_for_contact_form_7:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:querysol:redirection_for_contact_form_7:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:querysol:redirection_for_contact_form_7:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"]}
