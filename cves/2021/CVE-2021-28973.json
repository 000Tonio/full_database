If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2022-05-03T16:04:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2021-28973","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-05-03T16:04:00","references":["https://www.compass-security.com/fileadmin/Research/Advisories/2021-01_CSNC-2021-005_Helix_ALM_XXE.txt"],"summary":"The XML Import functionality of the Administration console in Perforce Helix ALM 2020.3.1 Build 22 accepts XML input data that is parsed by insecurely configured software components, leading to XXE attacks.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:perforce:helix_alm:2020.3.1:build_22:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:perforce:helix_alm:2020.3.1:build_22:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:perforce:helix_alm:2020.3.1:build_22:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
