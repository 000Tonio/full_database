With this vulnerability in place, an attacker may increment the incoming frame counter values by injecting messages with a sufficiently large frame counter value and invalid payload. This results in denial of service/valid packets in the network. There is also a possibility of a replay attack in the stack.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microchip:miwi:6.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microchip:miwi:6.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:microchip:miwi:6.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
