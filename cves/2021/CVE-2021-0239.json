By continuously sending this specific stream of genuine Layer 2 frames, an attacker can repeatedly crash the PFE, causing a sustained Denial of Service (DoS). This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: All versions prior to 20.4R1-EVO. This issue does not affect Junos OS versions.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos_os_evolved:20.4:r1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos_os_evolved:20.4:r1:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:juniper:junos_os_evolved:20.4:r1:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
