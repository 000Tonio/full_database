Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2021-12-07T13:13:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2021-36564","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2021-12-07T13:13:00","references":["https://github.com/top-think/framework/issues/2559"],"summary":"ThinkPHP v6.0.8 was discovered to contain a deserialization vulnerability via the component vendor\\league\\flysystem-cached-adapter\\src\\Storage\\Adapter.php.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:thinkphp:thinkphp:6.0.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:thinkphp:thinkphp:6.0.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:thinkphp:thinkphp:6.0.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
