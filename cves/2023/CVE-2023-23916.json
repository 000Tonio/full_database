The number of acceptable \"links\" in this \"decompression chain\" wascapped, but the cap was implemented on a per-header basis allowing a maliciousserver to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps simply byusing many headers. The use of such a decompression chain could result in a \"malloc bomb\", making curl end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying to and returning out of memory errors.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
