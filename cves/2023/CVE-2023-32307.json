The previous patch of [GHSA-8599-x7rq-fr54](https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-sip/security/advisories/GHSA-8599-x7rq-fr54) fixed the vulnerability when attr_type did not match the enum value, but there are also vulnerabilities in the handling of other valid cases. The OOB read and integer-overflow made by attacker may lead to crash, high consumption of memory or even other more serious consequences. These issue have been addressed in version 1.13.15. Users are advised to upgrade.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
