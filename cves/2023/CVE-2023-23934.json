Browsers may allow \"nameless\" cookies that look like `=value` instead of `key=value`. A vulnerable browser may allow a compromised application on an adjacent subdomain to exploit this to set a cookie like `=__Host-test=bad` for another subdomain. Werkzeug prior to 2.2.3 will parse the cookie `=__Host-test=bad` as __Host-test=bad`. If a Werkzeug application is running next to a vulnerable or malicious subdomain which sets such a cookie using a vulnerable browser, the Werkzeug application will see the bad cookie value but the valid cookie key. The issue is fixed in Werkzeug 2.2.3.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
