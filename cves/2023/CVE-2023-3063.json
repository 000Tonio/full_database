This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber privileges or above, to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
