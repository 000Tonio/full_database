There is a blocking operation when a task is in !TASK_RUNNING. In dvb_frontend_get_event, wait_event_interruptible is called; the condition is dvb_frontend_test_event(fepriv,events). In dvb_frontend_test_event, down(&fepriv->sem) is called. However, wait_event_interruptible would put the process to sleep, and down(&fepriv->sem) may block the process.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
