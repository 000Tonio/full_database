This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of certain parameters within 802.11 frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a wireless 802.11 association request frame with crafted parameters to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause an unexpected reload of an affected device, resulting in a DoS condition.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
