NOTE: Vendor states that allowing users to unfollow, mute, block, and report tweets and accounts and the impact of these negative engagements on Twitterâ€™s ranking algorithm is a conscious design decision, rather than a security vulnerability.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:twitter:recommendation_algorithm:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:twitter:recommendation_algorithm:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:twitter:recommendation_algorithm:2023-03-31:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:twitter:recommendation_algorithm:2023-03-31:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:twitter:recommendation_algorithm:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:twitter:recommendation_algorithm:2023-03-31:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
