This is due to the plugin checking if an IP had been blocklist via client-side scripts rather than server-side. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass any login restrictions that may prevent a brute force attack.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:lcweb:privatecontent:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:lcweb:privatecontent:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:lcweb:privatecontent:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"]}
