The default security setting must be to deny access and then grant access only to those resources intended by business logic.","summary":"In applications, particularly web applications, access to functionality is mitigated by an authorization framework. This framework maps Access Control Lists (ACLs) to elements of the application's functionality; particularly URL's for web apps. In the case that the administrator failed to specify an ACL for a particular element, an attacker may be able to access it with impunity. An attacker with the ability to access functionality not properly constrained by ACLs can obtain sensitive information and possibly compromise the entire application. Such an attacker can access resources that must be available only to users at a higher privilege level, can access management sections of the application, or can run queries for data that they otherwise not supposed to."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-434","id":"CVE-2023-36809","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-07-06T11:55:00","references":["https://www.github.com/kiwitcms/kiwi/commit/195ea53eaaf360c19227c864cc0fe58910032c3c","https://huntr.dev/bounties/511489dd-ba38-4806-9029-b28ab2830aa8/","https://kiwitcms.org/blog/kiwi-tcms-team/2023/07/04/kiwi-tcms-125/","https://huntr.dev/bounties/c6eeb346-fa99-4d41-bc40-b68f8d689223/","https://www.github.com/kiwitcms/kiwi/commit/ffb00450be52fe11a82a2507632c2328cae4ec9d","https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/security/advisories/GHSA-jpgw-2r9m-8qfw"],"summary":"Kiwi TCMS, an open source test management system allows users to upload attachments to test plans, test cases, etc. Versions of Kiwi TCMS prior to 12.5 had introduced changes which were meant to serve all uploaded files as plain text in order to prevent browsers from executing potentially dangerous files when such files are accessed directly. The previous Nginx configuration was incorrect allowing certain browsers like Firefox to ignore the `Content-Type: text/plain` header on some occasions thus allowing potentially dangerous scripts to be executed. Additionally, file upload validators and parts of the HTML rendering code had been found to require additional sanitation and improvements. Version 12.5 fixes this vulnerability with updated Nginx content type configuration, improved file upload validation code to prevent more potentially dangerous uploads, and Sanitization of test plan names used in the `tree_view_html()` function.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
