Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2023-23638","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-03-08T13:55:00","references":["https://lists.apache.org/thread/8h6zscfzj482z512d2v5ft63hdhzm0cb"],"summary":"A deserialization vulnerability existed when dubbo generic invoke, which could lead to malicious code execution.
