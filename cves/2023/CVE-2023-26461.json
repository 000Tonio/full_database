If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2023-26461","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-03-14T13:33:00","references":["https://www.sap.com/documents/2022/02/fa865ea4-167e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html","https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3284550"],"summary":"SAP NetWeaver allows (SAP Enterprise Portal) - version 7.50, allows an authenticated attacker with sufficient privileges to access the XML parser which can submit a crafted XML file which when parsed will enable them to access but not modify sensitive files and data.
