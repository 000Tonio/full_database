It spawns a web interface listening on port 8088. A user-controllable path is handed to a path-concatenation method (Path.Combine from .NET) without proper sanitisation. This yields the possibility of including local files, as well as remote files on SMB shares. If one provides a file with the extension .t4, it is rendered with the .NET templating engine mono/t4, which can execute code.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
