If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2023-22322","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-02-06T19:55:00","references":["https://jvn.jp/en/vu/JVNVU94200979/"],"summary":"Improper restriction of XML external entity reference (XXE) vulnerability exists in OMRON CX-Motion Pro 1.4.6.013 and earlier.
