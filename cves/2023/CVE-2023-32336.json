Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2023-32336","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-05-22T10:56:00","references":["https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/node/6995879","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/255285"],"summary":"IBM InfoSphere Information Server 11.7 is affected by a remote code execution vulnerability due to insecure deserialization in an RMI service.
