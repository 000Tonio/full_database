Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2023-1549","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-05-15T13:26:00","references":["https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/c94b3a68-673b-44d7-9251-f3590cc5ee9e"],"summary":"The Ad Inserter WordPress plugin before 2.7.27 unserializes user input provided via the settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform PHP Object Injection when a suitable gadget is present","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
