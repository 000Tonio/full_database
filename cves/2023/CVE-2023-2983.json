Through the identification of shared folders/drives between systems, the adversary may further their goals of locating and collecting sensitive information/files, or map potential routes for lateral movement within the network."},{"id":"637","name":"Collect Data from Clipboard","prerequisites":"The adversary must have a means (i.e., a pre-installed tool or background process) by which to collect data from the clipboard and store it. That is, when the target copies data to the clipboard (e.g., to paste into another application), the adversary needs some means of capturing that data in a third location.","related_weakness":["267"],"solutions":"While copying and pasting of data with the clipboard is a legitimate and practical function, certain situations and context may require the disabling of this feature. Just as certain applications disable screenshot capability, applications that handle highly sensitive information should consider disabling copy and paste functionality. Employ a robust identification and audit/blocking via whitelisting of applications on your system. Malware may contain the functionality associated with this attack pattern.","summary":"The adversary exploits an application that allows for the copying of sensitive data or information by collecting information copied to the clipboard. Data copied to the clipboard can be accessed by other applications, such as malware built to exfiltrate or log clipboard contents on a periodic basis. In this way, the adversary aims to garner information to which he is unauthorized."},{"id":"634","name":"Probe Audio and Video Peripherals","prerequisites":"Knowledge of the target device's or applicationâ€™s vulnerabilities that can be capitalized on with malicious code. The adversary must be able to place the malicious code on the target device.","related_weakness":["267"],"solutions":"Prevent unknown code from executing on a system through whitelisting policy. Patch installed applications as soon as new updates become available.","summary":"The adversary exploits the target system's audio and video functionalities through malware or scheduled tasks. The goal is to capture sensitive information about the target for financial, personal, political, or other gains which is accomplished by collecting communication data between two parties via the use of peripheral devices (e.g. microphones and webcams) or applications with audio and video capabilities (e.g. Skype) on a system."},{"id":"58","name":"Restful Privilege Elevation","prerequisites":"The attacker needs to be able to identify HTTP Get URLs. The Get methods must be set to call applications that perform operations other than get such as update and delete.","related_weakness":["264","267","269"],"solutions":"Design: Enforce principle of least privilege Implementation: Ensure that HTTP Get methods only retrieve state and do not alter state on the server side Implementation: Ensure that HTTP methods have proper ACLs based on what the functionality they expose","summary":"Rest uses standard HTTP (Get, Put, Delete) style permissions methods, but these are not necessarily correlated generally with back end programs. Strict interpretation of HTTP get methods means that these HTTP Get services should not be used to delete information on the server, but there is no access control mechanism to back up this logic. This means that unless the services are properly ACL'd and the application's service implementation are following these guidelines then an HTTP request can easily execute a delete or update on the server side. The attacker identifies a HTTP Get URL such as http://victimsite/updateOrder, which calls out to a program to update orders on a database or other resource. The URL is not idempotent so the request can be submitted multiple times by the attacker, additionally, the attacker may be able to exploit the URL published as a Get method that actually performs updates (instead of merely retrieving data). This may result in malicious or inadvertent altering of data on the server."},{"id":"648","name":"Collect Data from Screen Capture","prerequisites":"The adversary must have obtained logical access to the system by some means (e.g., via obtained credentials or planting malware on the system).","related_weakness":["267"],"solutions":"Identify potentially malicious software that may have functionality to acquire screen captures, and audit and/or block it by using whitelisting tools.

Through screenshots, the adversary aims to see what happens on the screen over the course of an operation. The adversary can leverage information gathered in order to carry out further attacks."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-267","id":"CVE-2023-2983","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-05-30T16:36:00","references":["https://huntr.dev/bounties/6b2f33d3-2fd0-4d2d-ad7b-2c1e2417eeb1","https://github.com/pimcore/pimcore/commit/c8f37b19c99cd82e4e558857d3e4d5476ea7228a"],"summary":"Privilege Defined With Unsafe Actions in GitHub repository pimcore/pimcore prior to 10.5.23.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
