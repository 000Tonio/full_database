Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2023-3232","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-06-14T06:15:00","references":["https://vuldb.com/?id.231503","https://github.com/HuBenLab/HuBenVulList/blob/main/CRMEB%20is%20vulnerable%20to%20Broken%20Access%20Control.md","https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.231503"],"summary":"A vulnerability was found in Zhong Bang CRMEB up to 4.6.0 and classified as critical.
