Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2023-0960","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-02-23T14:19:00","references":["https://github.com/jidle123/Seacms-v11.6/issues/1","https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.221630","https://note.youdao.com/ynoteshare/index.html?id=ef23876c8744c5c230f3874387c06b11","https://vuldb.com/?id.221630"],"summary":"A vulnerability was found in SeaCMS 11.6 and classified as problematic.
