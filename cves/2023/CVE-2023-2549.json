This is due to missing nonce validation in the 'createTempAccountLink' function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create a new user with administrator role via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. An attacker can leverage CVE-2023-2545 to get the login link or request a password reset to the new user's email address.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
