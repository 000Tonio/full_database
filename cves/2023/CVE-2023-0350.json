The adversary tricks the victim into accessing a URL that responds with the script file. Some browsers will detect that the specified MIME type of the file does not match the actual type of its content and will automatically switch to using an interpreter for the real content type. If the browser does not invoke script filters before doing this, the adversary's script may run on the target unsanitized, possibly revealing the victim's cookies or executing arbitrary script in their browser."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-646","id":"CVE-2023-0350","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-03-13T21:15:00","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-068-01"],"summary":"Akuvox E11 does not ensure that a file extension is associated with the file provided.
