When fixed files are unregistered, some context information (file_alloc_{start,end} and alloc_hint) is not cleared. A subsequent request that has auto index selection enabled via IORING_FILE_INDEX_ALLOC can cause a NULL pointer dereference. An unprivileged user can use the flaw to cause a system crash.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
