If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2023-2161","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-05-16T05:15:00","references":["https://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Doc_Ref=SEVD-2023-129-01&p_enDocType=Security+and+Safety+Notice&p_File_Name=SEVD-2023-129-01.pdf"],"summary":"\nA CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference vulnerability exists that\ncould cause unauthorized read access to the file system when a malicious configuration file is\nloaded on to the software by a local user.Â ","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
