Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2023-20853","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-04-27T02:15:00","references":["https://www.twcert.org.tw/tw/cp-132-7024-bdefe-1.html"],"summary":"aEnrich Technology a+HRD has a vulnerability of Deserialization of Untrusted Data within its MSMQ asynchronized message process.
