Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2023-29006","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-04-05T18:47:00","references":["https://github.com/pluginsGLPI/order/security/advisories/GHSA-xfx2-qx2r-3wwm","https://github.com/pluginsGLPI/order/commit/c78e64b95e54d5e47d9835984c93049f245b579e"],"summary":"The Order GLPI plugin allows users to manage order management within GLPI.
