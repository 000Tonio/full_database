When feeding untrusted user input into the size parameter of `NewBitfield` and `FromBytes` functions, an attacker can trigger `panic`s. This happen when the `size` is a not a multiple of `8` or is negative. There were already a note in the `NewBitfield` documentation, however known users of this package are subject to this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that `size` is a multiple of 8 before calling `NewBitfield` or `FromBytes`.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:protocol:go-bitfield:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:protocol:go-bitfield:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:protocol:go-bitfield:*:*:*:*:*:go:*:*"]}
