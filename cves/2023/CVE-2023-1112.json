Design: Ensure all input is validated, and does not contain file system commands Design: Run server interfaces with a non-root account and/or utilize chroot jails or other configuration techniques to constrain privileges even if attacker gains some limited access to commands. Design: For interactive user applications, consider if direct file system interface is necessary, instead consider having the application proxy communication. Implementation: Perform testing such as pen-testing and vulnerability scanning to identify directories, programs, and interfaces that grant direct access to executables.","summary":"An attacker manipulates inputs to the target software which the target software passes to file system calls in the OS.

Implementation: Use possible permissions on file access when developing and deploying web applications.","summary":"An attacker exploits a weakness in input validation on the target by supplying a specially constructed path utilizing dot and slash characters for the purpose of obtaining access to arbitrary files or resources. An attacker modifies a known path on the target in order to reach material that is not available through intended channels. These attacks normally involve adding additional path separators (/ or \\) and/or dots (.), or encodings thereof, in various combinations in order to reach parent directories or entirely separate trees of the target's directory structure."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-23","id":"CVE-2023-1112","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-03-01T13:44:00","references":["https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.222072","https://vuldb.com/?id.222072","https://github.com/Nickguitar/Drag-and-Drop-Multiple-File-Uploader-PRO-Path-Traversal"],"summary":"A vulnerability was found in Drag and Drop Multiple File Upload Contact Form 7 5.0.6.1.
