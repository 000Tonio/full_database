The target host does not do proper range checking on the variable before utilizing it. When the integer variable is incremented or decremented to an out of range value, it gets a very different value (e.g. very small or negative number)","related_weakness":["120","122","128","190","196","680","697"],"solutions":"Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking.

Always do bound checking before consuming user input data.","summary":"This attack forces an integer variable to go out of range. The integer variable is often used as an offset such as size of memory allocation or similarly. The attacker would typically control the value of such variable and try to get it out of range. For instance the integer in question is incremented past the maximum possible value, it may wrap to become a very small, or negative number, therefore providing a very incorrect value which can lead to unexpected behavior. At worst the attacker can execute arbitrary code."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-190","id":"CVE-2023-34453","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-06-15T20:46:00","references":["https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/blob/master/src/main/java/org/xerial/snappy/BitShuffle.java","https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/security/advisories/GHSA-pqr6-cmr2-h8hf","https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/commit/820e2e074c58748b41dbd547f4edba9e108ad905","https://github.com/xerial/snappy-java/blob/05c39b2ca9b5b7b39611529cc302d3d796329611/src/main/java/org/xerial/snappy/BitShuffle.java#L107"],"summary":"snappy-java is a fast compressor/decompressor for Java. Due to unchecked multiplications, an integer overflow may occur in versions prior to 1.1.10.1, causing a fatal error.\n\nThe function `shuffle(int[] input)` in the file `BitShuffle.java` receives an array of integers and applies a bit shuffle on it. It does so by multiplying the length by 4 and passing it to the natively compiled shuffle function. Since the length is not tested, the multiplication by four can cause an integer overflow and become a smaller value than the true size, or even zero or negative. In the case of a negative value, a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception will raise, which can crash the program. In a case of a value that is zero or too small, the code that afterwards references the shuffled array will assume a bigger size of the array, which might cause exceptions such as `java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.\n\nThe same issue exists also when using the `shuffle` functions that receive a double, float, long and short, each using a different multiplier that may cause the same issue.\n\nVersion 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this vulnerability.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
