Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2023-30899","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-05-09T14:30:00","references":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-789345.pdf"],"summary":"A vulnerability has been identified in Siveillance Video 2020 R2 (All versions < V20.2 HotfixRev14), Siveillance Video 2020 R3 (All versions < V20.3 HotfixRev12), Siveillance Video 2021 R1 (All versions < V21.1 HotfixRev12), Siveillance Video 2021 R2 (All versions < V21.2 HotfixRev8), Siveillance Video 2022 R1 (All versions < V22.1 HotfixRev7), Siveillance Video 2022 R2 (All versions < V22.2 HotfixRev5), Siveillance Video 2022 R3 (All versions < V22.3 HotfixRev2), Siveillance Video 2023 R1 (All versions < V23.1 HotfixRev1).
