Additionally, writing malicious data to log files may target jobs, filters, reports, and other agents that process the logs in an asynchronous attack pattern. This pattern of attack is similar to \"Log Injection-Tampering-Forging\" except that in this case, the attack is targeting the logs of the web server and not the application."},{"id":"93","name":"Log Injection-Tampering-Forging","prerequisites":"The target host is logging the action and data of the user.

The attacker injects, manipulates or forges malicious log entries in the log file, allowing him to mislead a log audit, cover traces of attack, or perform other malicious actions. The target host is not properly controlling log access. As a result tainted data is resulting in the log files leading to a failure in accountability, non-repudiation and incident forensics capability."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-75","id":"CVE-2023-1758","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-04-05T17:35:00","references":["https://github.com/thorsten/phpmyfaq/commit/f3380f46c464d1bc6f3ded29213c79be0de8fc57","https://huntr.dev/bounties/0854328e-eb00-41a3-9573-8da8f00e369c"],"summary":"Failure to Sanitize Special Elements into a Different Plane (Special Element Injection) in GitHub repository thorsten/phpmyfaq prior to 3.1.12.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
