Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2023-1669","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-05-02T08:15:00","references":["https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/fb8791f5-2879-431e-9afc-06d5839e4b9d"],"summary":"The SEOPress WordPress plugin before 6.5.0.3 unserializes user input provided via the settings, which could allow high-privilege users such as admin to perform PHP Object Injection when a suitable gadget is present.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
