Design: Ensure all input is validated, and does not contain file system commands Design: Run server interfaces with a non-root account and/or utilize chroot jails or other configuration techniques to constrain privileges even if attacker gains some limited access to commands. Design: For interactive user applications, consider if direct file system interface is necessary, instead consider having the application proxy communication. Implementation: Perform testing such as pen-testing and vulnerability scanning to identify directories, programs, and interfaces that grant direct access to executables.","summary":"An attacker manipulates inputs to the target software which the target software passes to file system calls in the OS.

Assume that user inputs are malicious. Utilize strict type, character, and encoding enforcement Implementation: Perform input validation for all remote content, including remote and user-generated content. Implementation: Validate user input by only accepting known good. Ensure all content that is delivered to client is sanitized against an acceptable content specification -- whitelisting approach. Implementation: Prefer working without user input when using file system calls Implementation: Use indirect references rather than actual file names. Implementation: Use possible permissions on file access when developing and deploying web applications.","summary":"An attacker exploits a weakness in input validation on the target by supplying a specially constructed path utilizing dot and slash characters for the purpose of obtaining access to arbitrary files or resources. An attacker modifies a known path on the target in order to reach material that is not available through intended channels. These attacks normally involve adding additional path separators (/ or \\) and/or dots (.), or encodings thereof, in various combinations in order to reach parent directories or entirely separate trees of the target's directory structure."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-23","id":"CVE-2023-2356","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-04-28T12:58:00","references":["https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow/commit/f73147496e05c09a8b83d95fb4f1bf86696c6342","https://huntr.dev/bounties/7b5d130d-38eb-4133-8c7d-0dfc9a9d9896"],"summary":"Relative Path Traversal in GitHub repository mlflow/mlflow prior to 2.3.1.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
