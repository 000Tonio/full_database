Additionally, it is not possible to explicitly save an empty security context to the HttpSessionSecurityContextRepository. This vulnerability can keep users authenticated even after they performed logout. Users of affected versions should apply the following mitigation. 5.7.x users should upgrade to 5.7.8. 5.8.x users should upgrade to 5.8.3. 6.0.x users should upgrade to 6.0.3.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:vmware:spring_security:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:vmware:spring_security:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:vmware:spring_security:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
