Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 112, Focus for Android < 112, Firefox ESR < 102.10, Firefox for Android < 112, and Thunderbird < 102.10.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
