Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2023-27978","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-03-21T11:51:00","references":["https://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Doc_Ref=SEVD-2023-073-04&p_enDocType=Security+and+Safety+Notice&p_File_Name=SEVD-2023-073-04.pdf"],"summary":"A CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability exists in the Dashboard module that could cause an interpretation of malicious payload data, potentially leading to remote code execution when an attacker gets the user to open a malicious file.
