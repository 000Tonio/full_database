When using a code book, application error messages aren't generated in string or stack trace form, but are catalogued and replaced with a unique (often integer-based) value 'coding' for the error. Such a technique will require helpdesk and hosting personnel to use a 'code book' or similar mapping to decode application errors/logs in order to respond to them normally. Design: wrap application functionality (preferably through the underlying framework) in an output encoding scheme that obscures or cleanses error messages to prevent such attacks. Such a technique is often used in conjunction with the above 'code book' suggestion. Implementation: Obfuscate server fields of HTTP response. Implementation: Hide inner ordering of HTTP response header. Implementation: Customizing HTTP error codes such as 404 or 500. Implementation: Hide HTTP response header software information filed. Implementation: Hide cookie's software information filed. Implementation: Obfuscate database type in Database API's error message.","summary":"An attacker sends random, malformed, or otherwise unexpected messages to a target application and observes the application's log or error messages returned. Fuzzing techniques involve sending random or malformed messages to a target and monitoring the target's response. The attacker does not initially know how a target will respond to individual messages but by attempting a large number of message variants they may find a variant that trigger's desired behavior. In this attack, the purpose of the fuzzing is to observe the application's log and error messages, although fuzzing a target can also sometimes cause the target to enter an unstable state, causing a crash. By observing logs and error messages, the attacker can learn details about the configuration of the target application and might be able to cause the target to disclose sensitive information."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-532","id":"CVE-2023-25163","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-02-18T21:48:00","references":["https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/issues/12309","https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/pull/12320","https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/security/advisories/GHSA-mv6w-j4xc-qpfw","https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/rbac/"],"summary":"Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. All versions of Argo CD starting with v2.6.0-rc1 have an output sanitization bug which leaks repository access credentials in error messages. These error messages are visible to the user, and they are logged. The error message is visible when a user attempts to create or update an Application via the Argo CD API (and therefor the UI or CLI). The user must have `applications, create` or `applications, update` RBAC access to reach the code which may produce the error. The user is not guaranteed to be able to trigger the error message. They may attempt to spam the API with requests to trigger a rate limit error from the upstream repository. If the user has `repositories, update` access, they may edit an existing repository to introduce a URL typo or otherwise force an error message. But if they have that level of access, they are probably intended to have access to the credentials anyway. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in version 2.6.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:rc1:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:rc1:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:rc2:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:rc2:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:rc3:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:rc3:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:rc4:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:rc4:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:rc5:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:rc5:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:rc6:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:rc6:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:rc7:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:rc7:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:-:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:-:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:rc1:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:rc2:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:rc3:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:rc4:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:rc5:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:rc6:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:rc7:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:linuxfoundation:argo_continuous_delivery:2.6.0:-:*:*:*:kubernetes:*:*"]}
