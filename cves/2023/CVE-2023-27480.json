If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2023-27480","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-03-07T20:14:00","references":["https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/e3527b98fdd8dc8179c24dc55e662b2c55199434","https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20320","https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-gx4f-976g-7g6v"],"summary":"XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it.
