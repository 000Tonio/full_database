This is due to the fact that during menu item deletion/modification, the plugin does not verify that the post ID provided to the AJAX action is indeed a menu item. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access or higher, to modify or delete arbitrary posts.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:thingsforrestaurants:quick_restaurant_menu:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:thingsforrestaurants:quick_restaurant_menu:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:thingsforrestaurants:quick_restaurant_menu:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"]}
