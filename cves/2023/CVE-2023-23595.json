If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2023-23595","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-01-24T16:35:00","references":["https://bluecatnetworks.com/integrations/adaptive-application/device-registration-portal-drp/","https://github.com/colemanjp/XXE-Vulnerability-in-Bluecat-Device-Registration-Portal-DRP","https://everything.curl.dev/usingcurl/netrc"],"summary":"BlueCat Device Registration Portal 2.2 allows XXE attacks that exfiltrate single-line files.
