Tainted data from the attacker is used and copied to temporary files. The target host does insecure temporary file creation.","related_weakness":["367","61","662","667","689"],"solutions":"Use safe libraries when creating temporary files. For instance the standard library function mkstemp can be used to safely create temporary files. For shell scripts, the system utility mktemp does the same thing. Access to the directories should be restricted as to prevent attackers from manipulating the files. Denying access to a file can prevent an attacker from replacing that file with a link to a sensitive file. Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning access rights to files. Ensure good compartmentalization in the system to provide protected areas that can be trusted.","summary":"This attack leverages the use of symbolic links (Symlinks) in order to write to sensitive files. An attacker can create a Symlink link to a target file not otherwise accessible to her. When the privileged program tries to create a temporary file with the same name as the Symlink link, it will actually write to the target file pointed to by the attackers' Symlink link. If the attacker can insert malicious content in the temporary file she will be writing to the sensitive file by using the Symlink. The race occurs because the system checks if the temporary file exists, then creates the file. The attacker would typically create the Symlink during the interval between the check and the creation of the temporary file."},{"id":"25","name":"Forced Deadlock","prerequisites":"The target host has a deadlock condition. There are four conditions for a deadlock to occur, known as the Coffman conditions. [R.25.3][REF-6] The target host exposes an API to the user.","related_weakness":["412","567","662","667","833"],"solutions":"Use known algorithm to avoid deadlock condition (for instance non-blocking synchronization algorithms). For competing actions, use well-known libraries which implement synchronization.","summary":"The adversary triggers and exploits a deadlock condition in the target software to cause a denial of service. A deadlock can occur when two or more competing actions are waiting for each other to finish, and thus neither ever does. Deadlock conditions can be difficult to detect."},{"id":"26","name":"Leveraging Race Conditions","prerequisites":"A resource is accessed/modified concurrently by multiple processes such that a race condition exists. The adversary has the ability to modify the resource.","related_weakness":["362","363","366","368","370","662","665","667","689"],"solutions":"Use safe libraries to access resources such as files. Be aware that improper use of access function calls such as chown(), tempfile(), chmod(), etc. can cause a race condition. Use synchronization to control the flow of execution. Use static analysis tools to find race conditions. Pay attention to concurrency problems related to the access of resources.","summary":"The adversary targets a race condition occurring when multiple processes access and manipulate the same resource concurrently, and the outcome of the execution depends on the particular order in which the access takes place. The adversary can leverage a race condition by \"running the race\", modifying the resource and modifying the normal execution flow. For instance, a race condition can occur while accessing a file: the adversary can trick the system by replacing the original file with his version and cause the system to read the malicious file."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-667","id":"CVE-2023-2269","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-05-14T03:15:00","references":["https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/ZD1xyZxb3rHot8PV@redhat.com/t/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/63AJUCJTZCII2JMAF7MGZEM66KY7IALT/"],"summary":"A denial of service problem was found, due to a possible recursive locking scenario, resulting in a deadlock in table_clear in drivers/md/dm-ioctl.c in the Linux Kernel Device Mapper-Multipathing sub-component.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
