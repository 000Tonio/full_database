This can result in the crashing of the application or, for certain pointer values, access to data that would not normally be possible or the execution of arbitrary code. Since pointers are simply integer variables, Integer Attacks may often be used in Pointer Attacks."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-823","id":"CVE-2023-2426","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-04-29T22:15:00","references":["https://huntr.dev/bounties/3451be4c-91c8-4d08-926b-cbff7396f425","https://github.com/vim/vim/commit/caf642c25de526229264cab9425e7c9979f3509b"],"summary":"Use of Out-of-range Pointer Offset in GitHub repository vim/vim prior to 9.0.1499.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
