If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2023-2806","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-05-19T13:00:00","references":["https://vuldb.com/?id.229411","https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.229411","https://github.com/Strangenees/e-cology/blob/main/main.md"],"summary":"A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in Weaver e-cology up to 9.0.
