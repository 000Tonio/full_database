This is unrelated to CWE-676. It may write beyond the bounds of the destination buffer when attempting to write a padded, thousands-separated string representation of a number, if the buffer is allocated the exact size required to represent that number as a string. For example, 1,234,567 (with padding to 13) overflows by two bytes.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:gnu:glibc:2.37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:gnu:glibc:2.37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:gnu:glibc:2.37:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
