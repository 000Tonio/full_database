If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2023-1288","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-03-20T14:15:00","references":["https://www.3ds.com/vulnerability/advisories"],"summary":"An XML External Entity injection (XXE) vulnerability in ENOVIA Live Collaboration V6R2013xE allows an attacker to read local files on the server.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:3ds:enovia_live_collaboration:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:3ds:enovia_live_collaboration:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:3ds:enovia_live_collaboration:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
