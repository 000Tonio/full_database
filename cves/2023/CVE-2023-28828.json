If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2023-28828","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-04-11T13:19:00","references":["https://cert-portal.siemens.com/productcert/pdf/ssa-632164.pdf"],"summary":"A vulnerability has been identified in Polarion ALM (All versions < V2304.0).
