The attacker will, for most circumstances, also need to be able to place code in the victim container. This does not necessarily mean that they will have to subvert host-level security, except when explicitly indicated.","related_weakness":["325","328"],"solutions":"A given code signing scheme may be fallible due to improper use of cryptography. Developers must never roll out their own cryptography, nor should existing primitives be modified or ignored. If an attacker cannot attack the scheme directly, he might try to alter the environment that affects the signing and verification processes. A possible mitigation is to avoid reliance on flags or environment variables that are user-controllable.","summary":"Many languages use code signing facilities to vouch for code's identity and to thus tie code to its assigned privileges within an environment. Subverting this mechanism can be instrumental in an attacker escalating privilege. Any means of subverting the way that a virtual machine enforces code signing classifies for this style of attack."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-325","id":"CVE-2023-28999","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-04-04T17:40:00","references":["https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/infk/inst-infsec/appliedcrypto/education/theses/report_DanieleCoppola.pdf","https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories/GHSA-8875-wxww-3rr8","https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/pull/5560"],"summary":"Nextcloud is an open-source productivity platform.
