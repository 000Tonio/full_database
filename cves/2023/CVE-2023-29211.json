Implementation: Perform testing such as pen-testing and vulnerability scanning to identify directories, programs, and interfaces that grant direct access to executables. Implementation: Implement host integrity monitoring to detect any unwanted altering of configuration files. Implementation: Ensure that files that are not required to execute, such as configuration files, are not over-privileged, i.e. not allowed to execute.","summary":"An attack of this type exploits a system's trust in configuration and resource files. When the executable loads the resource (such as an image file or configuration file) the attacker has modified the file to either execute malicious code directly or manipulate the target process (e.g. application server) to execute based on the malicious configuration parameters. Since systems are increasingly interrelated mashing up resources from local and remote sources the possibility of this attack occurring is high."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-95","id":"CVE-2023-29211","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-04-16T07:15:00","references":["https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/security/advisories/GHSA-w7v9-fc49-4qg4","https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-platform/commit/ba4c76265b0b8a5e2218be400d18f08393fe1428#diff-64f39f5f2cc8c6560a44e21a5cfd509ef00e8a2157cd9847c9940a2e08ea43d1R63-R64","https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-20297"],"summary":"XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top level XWiki projects. Any user with view rights `WikiManager.DeleteWiki` can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python or Velocity code in XWiki leading to full access to the XWiki installation.
