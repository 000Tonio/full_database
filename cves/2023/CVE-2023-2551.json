This is usually accomplished through an insecurely configured PHP runtime environment and an improperly sanitized \"include\" or \"require\" call, which the user can then control to point to any web-accessible file. This allows adversaries to hijack the targeted application and force it to execute their own instructions."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-98","id":"CVE-2023-2551","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-05-05T20:15:00","references":["https://github.com/unilogies/bumsys/commit/86e29dd23df348ec6075f0c0de8e06b8d9fb0a9a","https://huntr.dev/bounties/5723613c-55c6-4f18-9ed3-61ad44f5de9c"],"summary":"PHP Remote File Inclusion in GitHub repository unilogies/bumsys prior to 2.1.1.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
