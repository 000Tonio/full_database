Most applications assume that users will provide static text and may respond unpredictably to the presence of formatting character. For example, in certain functions of the C programming languages such as printf, the formatting character %s will print the contents of a memory location expecting this location to identify a string and the formatting character %n prints the number of DWORD written in the memory. An adversary can use this to read or write to memory locations or files, or simply to manipulate the value of the resulting text in unexpected ways. Reading or writing memory may result in program crashes and writing memory could result in the execution of arbitrary code if the adversary can write to the program stack."}],"cvss":7.2,"cvss-time":"2018-10-10T19:35:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-134","id":"CVE-2009-1262","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2018-10-10T19:35:00","references":["http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2009-April/068583.html","http://osvdb.org/53266","http://secunia.com/advisories/34524","http://www.layereddefense.com/FortiClient02Apr.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/502354/100/0/threaded","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/502602/100/0/threaded","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/34343","http://www.securitytracker.com/id?1021966","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2009/0941","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/49633"],"refmap":{"bid":["34343"],"bugtraq":["20090402 Layered Defense Research Advisory: Format String Vulnerability: FortiClient Version 3","20090410 Re: Layered Defense Research Advisory: Format String Vulnerability: FortiClient Version 3"],"fulldisc":["20090402 Layered Defense Research Advisory: Format String Vulnerability: FortiClient Version 3"],"misc":["http://www.layereddefense.com/FortiClient02Apr.html"],"osvdb":["53266"],"sectrack":["1021966"],"secunia":["34524"],"vupen":["ADV-2009-0941"],"xf":["forticlient-vpn-format-string(49633)"]},"summary":"Format string vulnerability in Fortinet FortiClient 3.0.614, and possibly earlier, allows local users to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the VPN connection name.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:fortinet:forticlient:3.0.614:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:fortinet:forticlient:3.0.614:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:h:fortinet:forticlient:3.0.614:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
