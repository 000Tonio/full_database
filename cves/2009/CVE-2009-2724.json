The adversary can leverage a race condition by \"running the race\", modifying the resource and modifying the normal execution flow. For instance, a race condition can occur while accessing a file: the adversary can trick the system by replacing the original file with his version and cause the system to read the malicious file."},{"id":"29","name":"Leveraging Time-of-Check and Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Conditions","prerequisites":"A resource is access/modified concurrently by multiple processes.

A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":9.3,"cvss-time":"2018-10-10T19:42:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2009-2724","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2018-10-10T19:42:00","redhat":{"rpms":["java-1.5.0-sun-0:1.5.0.20-1jpp.1.el4","java-1.5.0-sun-0:1.5.0.20-1jpp.1.el5","java-1.5.0-sun-demo-0:1.5.0.20-1jpp.1.el4","java-1.5.0-sun-demo-0:1.5.0.20-1jpp.1.el5","java-1.5.0-sun-devel-0:1.5.0.20-1jpp.1.el4","java-1.5.0-sun-devel-0:1.5.0.20-1jpp.1.el5","java-1.5.0-sun-jdbc-0:1.5.0.20-1jpp.1.el4","java-1.5.0-sun-jdbc-0:1.5.0.20-1jpp.1.el5","java-1.5.0-sun-plugin-0:1.5.0.20-1jpp.1.el4","java-1.5.0-sun-plugin-0:1.5.0.20-1jpp.1.el5","java-1.5.0-sun-src-0:1.5.0.20-1jpp.1.el4","java-1.5.0-sun-src-0:1.5.0.20-1jpp.1.el5"]},"references":["http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/ReleaseNotes.html","http://secunia.com/advisories/37386","http://secunia.com/advisories/37460","http://security.gentoo.org/glsa/glsa-200911-02.xml","http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-21-118667-22-1","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/507985/100/0/threaded","http://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2009-0016.html","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2009/3316"],"refmap":{"bugtraq":["20091120 VMSA-2009-0016 VMware vCenter and ESX update release and vMA patch release address multiple security issue in third party components"],"confirm":["http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/ReleaseNotes.html","http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-21-118667-22-1","http://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2009-0016.html"],"gentoo":["GLSA-200911-02"],"secunia":["37386","37460"],"vupen":["ADV-2009-3316"]},"summary":"Race condition in the java.lang package in Sun Java SE 5.0 before Update 20 has unknown impact and attack vectors, related to a \"3Y Race condition in reflection checks.\"","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sun:java_se:*:19:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sun:java_se:*:19:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sun:java_se:*:19:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
