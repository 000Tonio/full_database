NOTE: the vendor and original researcher have disputed this issue, since legitimate requests can generate the same amount of resource consumption.  CVE concurs with the dispute, so this identifier should not be used.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
