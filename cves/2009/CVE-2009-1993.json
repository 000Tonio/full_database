In Oracle Database releases up to and including 10g Release 2, Oracle Application Express was separately installed from a Companion CD supplied with the Oracle Database CD set or from a package downloaded from an Oracle web site. If you have not installed Oracle Application Express from the companion CD or from a packaged download from an Oracle web site, no further action is required. From Oracle Database 11g onwards, Oracle Application Express is included in the default installation of the Oracle Database.\r\n\r\nIf you have Oracle Application Express installed in an Oracle Database home, then refer to Critical Patch Update October 2009 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, My Oracle Support Note 881382.1 for the version to be installed. \"","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:oracle:database_server:3.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:oracle:database_server:3.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:oracle:database_server:3.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
