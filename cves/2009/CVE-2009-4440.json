The adversary can leverage a race condition by \"running the race\", modifying the resource and modifying the normal execution flow. For instance, a race condition can occur while accessing a file: the adversary can trick the system by replacing the original file with his version and cause the system to read the malicious file."},{"id":"29","name":"Leveraging Time-of-Check and Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Conditions","prerequisites":"A resource is access/modified concurrently by multiple processes.

A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2010-06-13T19:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2009-4440","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2010-06-13T19:15:00","references":["http://secunia.com/advisories/37915","http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-21-141958-01-1","http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-66-270789-1","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/37481","http://www.securitytracker.com/id?1023389","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2009/3647"],"refmap":{"bid":["37481"],"confirm":["http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-21-141958-01-1"],"sectrack":["1023389"],"secunia":["37915"],"sunalert":["270789"],"vupen":["ADV-2009-3647"]},"summary":"Directory Proxy Server (DPS) in Sun Java System Directory Server Enterprise Edition 6.0 through 6.3.1 does not properly handle multiple client connections within a short time window, which allows remote attackers to hijack the backend connection of an authenticated user, and obtain the privileges of this user, by making a client connection in opportunistic circumstances, related to \"long binds,\" aka Bug Ids 6828462 and 6823593.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sun:java_system_directory_server:6.0:*:enterprise:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sun:java_system_directory_server:6.0:*:enterprise:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sun:java_system_directory_server:6.1:enterprise:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sun:java_system_directory_server:6.1:enterprise:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sun:java_system_directory_server:6.2:enterprise:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sun:java_system_directory_server:6.2:enterprise:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sun:java_system_directory_server:6.3:enterprise:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sun:java_system_directory_server:6.3:enterprise:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sun:java_system_directory_server:6.0:*:enterprise:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:sun:java_system_directory_server:6.1:enterprise:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:sun:java_system_directory_server:6.2:enterprise:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:sun:java_system_directory_server:6.3:enterprise:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
