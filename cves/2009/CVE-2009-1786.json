A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":6.9,"cvss-time":"2017-09-29T01:34:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2009-1786","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2017-09-29T01:34:00","oval":[{"accepted":"2009-08-31T04:00:09.685-04:00","class":"vulnerability","contributors":[{"name":"Aharon Chernin","organization":"DTCC"}],"definition_extensions":[{"comment":"IBM AIX 5300-00 is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:6195"},{"comment":"IBM AIX 5300-01 through 5300-06 is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:5973"},{"comment":"IBM AIX 5300-07 is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:5707"},{"comment":"IBM AIX 5300-08 is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:5293"},{"comment":"IBM AIX 5300-09 is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:6306"},{"comment":"IBM AIX 6100-00 is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:5589"},{"comment":"IBM AIX 6100-01 is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:5959"},{"comment":"IBM AIX 6100-02 is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:5685"}],"description":"The malloc subsystem in libc in IBM AIX 5.3 and 6.1 allows local users to create or overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the log file associated with the MALLOCDEBUG environment variable.","family":"unix","id":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:6276","status":"accepted","submitted":"2009-07-18T15:10:44.000-05:00","title":"Malloc subsystem in libc in IBM AIX 5.3 and 6.1 vulnerability.","version":"43"}],"references":["http://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/libc_advisory.asc","http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=802","http://secunia.com/advisories/35146","http://securitytracker.com/id?1022261","http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IZ50121","http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IZ50129","http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IZ50139","http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IZ50445","http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IZ50447","http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IZ50500","http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=isg1IZ50517","http://www.osvdb.org/54617","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/35034","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2009/1380","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/50636","https://oval.cisecurity.org/repository/search/definition/oval%3Aorg.mitre.oval%3Adef%3A6276","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9306"],"refmap":{"aixapar":["IZ50121","IZ50129","IZ50139","IZ50445","IZ50447","IZ50500","IZ50517"],"bid":["35034"],"confirm":["http://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/libc_advisory.asc"],"exploit-db":["9306"],"idefense":["20090520 IBM AIX libc MALLOCDEBUG File Overwrite Vulnerability"],"osvdb":["54617"],"sectrack":["1022261"],"secunia":["35146"],"vupen":["ADV-2009-1380"],"xf":["aix-mallocdebug-privilege-escalation(50636)"]},"summary":"The malloc subsystem in libc in IBM AIX 5.3 and 6.1 allows local users to create or overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the log file associated with the MALLOCDEBUG environment variable.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:ibm:aix:5.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:ibm:aix:5.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:ibm:aix:6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:ibm:aix:6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:ibm:aix:5.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:ibm:aix:6.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
