NOTE: a reliable third party reports that this is not a vulnerability, because it results in a more restrictive security policy.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:php:php:5.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:php:php:5.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:php:php:5.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
