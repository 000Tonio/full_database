Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-40238","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-10-28T17:41:00","references":["https://github.com/CERTCC/VINCE/issues?q=label%3Asecurity"],"summary":"A Remote Code Injection vulnerability exists in CERT software prior to version 1.50.5.
