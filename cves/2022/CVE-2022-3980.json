If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-3980","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-11-18T04:47:00","references":["https://www.sophos.com/en-us/security-advisories/sophos-sa-20221116-smc-xee"],"summary":"An XML External Entity (XEE) vulnerability allows server-side request forgery (SSRF) and potential code execution in Sophos Mobile managed on-premises between versions 5.0.0 and 9.7.4.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sophos:mobile:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sophos:mobile:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sophos:mobile:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
