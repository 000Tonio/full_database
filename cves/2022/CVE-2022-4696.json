If IORING_OP_SPLICE is missing the IO_WQ_WORK_FILES flag, which signals that the operation won't use current->nsproxy, so its reference counter is not increased. This assumption is not always true as calling io_splice on specific files will call the get_uts function which will use current->nsproxy leading to invalidly decreasing its reference counter later causing the use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading to version 5.10.160 or above","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:5.7:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:5.7:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:linux:linux_kernel:5.7:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
