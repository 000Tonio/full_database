Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-44351","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-12-10T03:06:00","references":["https://github.com/zorlan/skycaiji/issues/46"],"summary":"Skycaiji v2.5.1 was discovered to contain a deserialization vulnerability via /SkycaijiApp/admin/controller/Mystore.php.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:skycaiji:skycaiji:2.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:skycaiji:skycaiji:2.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:skycaiji:skycaiji:2.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
