Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":10,"cvss-time":"2022-06-09T20:08:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-1660","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2022-06-09T20:08:00","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-146-01"],"summary":"The affected products are vulnerable of untrusted data due to deserialization without prior authorization/authentication, which may allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:keysight:n6854a_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:keysight:n6854a_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:keysight:n6854a:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:keysight:n6854a:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:keysight:n6841a_rf_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:keysight:n6841a_rf_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:keysight:n6841a_rf:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:keysight:n6841a_rf:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:keysight:n6854a_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:keysight:n6841a_rf_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
