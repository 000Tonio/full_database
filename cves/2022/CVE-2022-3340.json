If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-3340","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-11-08T16:14:00","references":["https://kcm.trellix.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10388"],"summary":"XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in Trellix IPS Manager prior to 10.1 M8 allows a remote authenticated administrator to perform XXE attack in the administrator interface part of the interface, which allows a saved XML configuration file to be imported.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:trellix:intrusion_prevention_system_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:trellix:intrusion_prevention_system_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:trellix:intrusion_prevention_system_manager:10.1:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:trellix:intrusion_prevention_system_manager:10.1:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:trellix:intrusion_prevention_system_manager:10.1:minor8:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:trellix:intrusion_prevention_system_manager:10.1:minor8:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:trellix:intrusion_prevention_system_manager:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:trellix:intrusion_prevention_system_manager:10.1:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:trellix:intrusion_prevention_system_manager:10.1:minor8:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
