Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-45136","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-11-17T23:14:00","references":["https://lists.apache.org/thread/mc77cdl5stgjtjoldk467gdf756qjt31","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/14/5"],"summary":"** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Apache Jena SDB 3.17.0 and earlier is vulnerable to a JDBC Deserialisation attack if the attacker is able to control the JDBC URL used or cause the underlying database server to return malicious data.
