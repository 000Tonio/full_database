The Directus process can be aborted by having an authorized user update the `filename_disk` value to a folder and accessing that file through the `/assets` endpoint. This vulnerability has been patched and release v9.15.0 contains the fix. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may prevent this problem by making sure no (untrusted) non-admin users have permissions to update the `filename_disk` field on `directus_files`.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:monospace:directus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:monospace:directus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:monospace:directus:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
