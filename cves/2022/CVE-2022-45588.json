If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-45588","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-03-16T03:15:00","references":["https://www.talend.com/security/incident-response/#CVE-2022-45588","http://talend.com"],"summary":"All versions before R2022-09 of Talend's Remote Engine Gen 2 are potentially vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) type of attacks.
