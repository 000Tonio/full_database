If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-45588","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-02-13T15:09:00","references":["https://www.talend.com/security/incident-response/#CVE-2022-45588","http://talend.com"],"summary":"XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in Talend Remote Engine Gen 2 before R2022-09.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:talend:remote_engine_gen_2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:talend:remote_engine_gen_2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:talend:remote_engine_gen_2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
