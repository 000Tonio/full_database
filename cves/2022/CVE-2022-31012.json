The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":4.4,"cvss-time":"2022-07-22T16:50:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2022-31012","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-07-22T16:50:00","references":["https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/tag/v2.37.1.windows.1","https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/security/advisories/GHSA-gjrj-fxvp-hjj2"],"summary":"Git for Windows is a fork of Git that contains Windows-specific patches. This vulnerability in versions prior to 2.37.1 lets Git for Windows' installer execute a binary into `C:\\mingw64\\bin\\git.exe` by mistake. This only happens upon a fresh install, not when upgrading Git for Windows. A patch is included in version 2.37.1. Two workarounds are available. Create the `C:\\mingw64` folder and remove read/write access from this folder, or disallow arbitrary authenticated users to create folders in `C:\\`.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:gitforwindows:git:-:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:gitforwindows:git:-:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:gitforwindows:git:2.34.1:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:gitforwindows:git:2.34.1:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:gitforwindows:git:-:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:gitforwindows:git:2.34.1:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*"]}
