Design: Ensure all input is validated, and does not contain file system commands Design: Run server interfaces with a non-root account and/or utilize chroot jails or other configuration techniques to constrain privileges even if attacker gains some limited access to commands. Design: For interactive user applications, consider if direct file system interface is necessary, instead consider having the application proxy communication. Implementation: Perform testing such as pen-testing and vulnerability scanning to identify directories, programs, and interfaces that grant direct access to executables.","summary":"An attacker manipulates inputs to the target software which the target software passes to file system calls in the OS.

Implementation: Use possible permissions on file access when developing and deploying web applications.","summary":"An attacker exploits a weakness in input validation on the target by supplying a specially constructed path utilizing dot and slash characters for the purpose of obtaining access to arbitrary files or resources. An attacker modifies a known path on the target in order to reach material that is not available through intended channels.
