A flaw was found in REST API in StarWind Stack. REST command, which allows changing the hostname, doesnâ€™t check a new hostname parameter. It goes directly to bash as part of a script. An attacker with non-root user access can inject arbitrary data into the command that will be executed with root privileges.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:starwindsoftware:starwind_san_\\&_nas:0.2:build_1914:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:starwindsoftware:starwind_san_\\&_nas:0.2:build_1914:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:starwindsoftware:starwind_san_\\&_nas:0.2:build_1914:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
