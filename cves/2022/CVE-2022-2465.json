Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-2465","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-08-27T03:30:00","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-202-03"],"summary":"Rockwell Automation ISaGRAF Workbench software versions 6.0 through 6.6.9 are affected by a Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability.
