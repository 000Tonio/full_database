By appending ;i18ntranslation or /../i18ntranslation/ to the end of a URL, users with no privileges can access privileged API endpoints. This can lead to remote code execution by abusing the privileged API actions.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:bonitasoft:bonita_web:2021.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:bonitasoft:bonita_web:2021.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:bonitasoft:bonita_web:2021.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
