If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-4818","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-01-06T15:33:00","references":["https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.216997","https://vuldb.com/?id.216997","https://github.com/Talend/tmdm-server-se/releases/tag/snap%2Fmaster%2F20221220_1938","https://github.com/Talend/tmdm-server-se/pull/1598","https://github.com/Talend/tmdm-server-se/commit/95590db2ad6a582c371273ceab1a73ad6ed47853"],"summary":"A vulnerability was found in Talend Open Studio for MDM.
