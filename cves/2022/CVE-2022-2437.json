Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-2437","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-07-25T15:41:00","references":["https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset?sfp_email=&sfph_mail=&reponame=&old=2754749%40feed-them-social&new=2754749%40feed-them-social&sfp_email=&sfph_mail=","https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories/#CVE-2022-2437"],"summary":"The Feed Them Social â€“ for Twitter feed, Youtube and more plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to deserialization of untrusted input via the 'fts_url' parameter in versions up to, and including 2.9.8.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to call files using a PHAR wrapper that will deserialize the data and call arbitrary PHP Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized payload.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:slickremix:feed_them_social:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:slickremix:feed_them_social:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:slickremix:feed_them_social:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"]}
