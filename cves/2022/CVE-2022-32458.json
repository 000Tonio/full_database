If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-32458","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-09-14T21:02:00","references":["https://www.twcert.org.tw/tw/cp-132-6288-49e01-1.html","https://www.chtsecurity.com/news/09757883-fea6-4aff-9e22-8ae8c4f8f7bb"],"summary":"Digiwin BPM has a XML External Entity Injection (XXE) vulnerability due to insufficient validation for user input.
