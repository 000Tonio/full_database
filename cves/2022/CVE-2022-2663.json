An 'explicit intent' is delivered to a specific application as declared within the intent, whereas an 'implicit intent' is directed to an application as defined by the Android operating system. If an implicit intent must be used, then it should be assumed that the intent will be received by an unknown application and any response should be treated accordingly (i.e., with appropriate security controls). Never use implicit intents for inter-application communication.","summary":"An adversary intercepts an implicit intent sent to launch a trusted activity and instead launches a counterfeit activity in its place.
