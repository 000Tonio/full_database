This allows the attacker to have full read access to user data, make limited modifications to user data, and degrade the performance of the system, leading to a high impact on confidentiality and a limited impact on the availability and integrity of the application.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver_process_integration:7.50:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver_process_integration:7.50:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver_process_integration:7.50:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
