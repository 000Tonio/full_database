If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-2759","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-09-02T21:53:00","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-228-03"],"summary":"Delta Electronics Delta Robot Automation Studio (DRAS) versions prior to 1.13.20 are affected by improper restrictions where the software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.
