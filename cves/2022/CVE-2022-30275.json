It utilizes an MDLC driver to communicate with MOSCAD/ACE RTUs for engineering purposes. Access to these communications is protected by a password stored in cleartext in the wmdlcdrv.ini driver configuration file. In addition, this password is used for access control to MOSCAD/STS projects protected with the Legacy Password feature. In this case, an insecure CRC of the password is present in the project file: this CRC is validated against the password in the driver configuration file.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:motorolasolutions:mdlc:4.80.0024:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:motorolasolutions:mdlc:4.80.0024:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:motorolasolutions:mdlc:4.82.004:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:motorolasolutions:mdlc:4.82.004:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:motorolasolutions:mdlc:4.83.001:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:motorolasolutions:mdlc:4.83.001:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:motorolasolutions:mdlc:4.80.0024:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:motorolasolutions:mdlc:4.82.004:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:motorolasolutions:mdlc:4.83.001:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
