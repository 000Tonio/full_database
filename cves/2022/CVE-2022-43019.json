Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-43019","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-10-20T05:47:00","references":["https://github.com/hansmach1ne/opencats_zero-days/blob/main/RCE_via_deserialisation.md"],"summary":"OpenCATS v0.9.6 was discovered to contain a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability via the getDataGridPager's ajax functionality.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:opencats:opencats:0.9.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:opencats:opencats:0.9.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:opencats:opencats:0.9.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
