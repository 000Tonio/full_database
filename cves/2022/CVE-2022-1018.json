If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2022-04-12T16:08:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-1018","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-04-12T16:08:00","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-088-01"],"summary":"When opening a malicious solution file provided by an attacker, the application suffers from an XML external entity vulnerability due to an unsafe call within a dynamic link library file.
