Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-38650","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-11-16T23:20:00","references":["https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/alerts/multiple-vulnerabilities-vmware-vrealize-hyperic-monitoring-and-performance-management-product"],"summary":"** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** A remote unauthenticated insecure deserialization vulnerability exists in VMware Hyperic Server 5.8.6.
