Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-41778","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-01-23T18:28:00","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-298-07"],"summary":"Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master versions 00.00.01a and prior deserialize user-supplied data provided through the Device-DataCollect service port without proper verification.
