This can result in the crashing of the application or, for certain pointer values, access to data that would not normally be possible or the execution of arbitrary code. Since pointers are simply integer variables, Integer Attacks may often be used in Pointer Attacks."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-823","id":"CVE-2022-46378","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-05-10T17:06:00","references":["https://github.com/weston-embedded/uC-FTPs/pull/2","https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2022-1681"],"summary":"An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the PORT command parameter extraction functionality of Weston Embedded uC-FTPs v 1.98.00.
