The default security setting must be to deny access and then grant access only to those resources intended by business logic.","summary":"In applications, particularly web applications, access to functionality is mitigated by an authorization framework. This framework maps Access Control Lists (ACLs) to elements of the application's functionality; particularly URL's for web apps. In the case that the administrator failed to specify an ACL for a particular element, an attacker may be able to access it with impunity. An attacker with the ability to access functionality not properly constrained by ACLs can obtain sensitive information and possibly compromise the entire application. Such an attacker can access resources that must be available only to users at a higher privilege level, can access management sections of the application, or can run queries for data that they otherwise not supposed to."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-434","id":"CVE-2022-36065","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-09-12T15:48:00","references":["https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/pull/487","https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/security/advisories/GHSA-j24q-55xh-wm4r","https://github.com/growthbook/growthbook/commit/1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264"],"summary":"GrowthBook is an open-source platform for feature flagging and A/B testing. With some self-hosted configurations in versions prior to 2022-08-29, attackers can register new accounts and upload files to arbitrary directories within the container. If the attacker uploads a Python script to the right location, they can execute arbitrary code within the container. To be affected, ALL of the following must be true: Self-hosted deployment (GrowthBook Cloud is unaffected); using local file uploads (as opposed to S3 or Google Cloud Storage); NODE_ENV set to a non-production value and JWT_SECRET set to an easily guessable string like `dev`. This issue is patched in commit 1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264 (2022-08-29). As a workaround, set `JWT_SECRET` environment variable to a long random string. This will stop arbitrary file uploads, but the only way to stop attackers from registering accounts is by updating to the latest build.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.2.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.2.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:1.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:1.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:1.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:1.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:1.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:1.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:1.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:1.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:1.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:1.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:1.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:1.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.1.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.2.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.8.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:0.9.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:1.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:1.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:1.2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:1.3.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:1.4.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:growthbook:growthbook:1.5.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
