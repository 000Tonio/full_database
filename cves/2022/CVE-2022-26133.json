Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2022-04-28T17:50:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-26133","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-04-28T17:50:00","references":["https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/BSERV-13173","https://confluence.atlassian.com/security/multiple-products-security-advisory-hazelcast-vulnerable-to-remote-code-execution-cve-2016-10750-1116292387.html"],"summary":"SharedSecretClusterAuthenticator in Atlassian Bitbucket Data Center versions 5.14.0 and later before 7.6.14, 7.7.0 and later prior to 7.17.6, 7.18.0 and later prior to 7.18.4, 7.19.0 and later prior to 7.19.4, and 7.20.0 allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code via Java deserialization.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:bitbucket_data_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:bitbucket_data_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:bitbucket_data_center:7.20.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:bitbucket_data_center:7.20.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:bitbucket_data_center:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:atlassian:bitbucket_data_center:7.20.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
