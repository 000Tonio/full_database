Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-39008","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-09-21T13:55:00","references":["https://device.harmonyos.com/en/docs/security/update/security-bulletins-phones-202209-0000001392278845","https://consumer.huawei.com/en/support/bulletin/2022/9/"],"summary":"The NFC module has bundle serialization/deserialization vulnerabilities.
