Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2022-05-26T01:39:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-1118","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-05-26T01:39:00","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-095-01"],"summary":"Connected Components Workbench (v13.00.00 and prior), ISaGRAF Workbench (v6.0 though v6.6.9), and Safety Instrumented System Workstation (v1.2 and prior (for Trusted Controllers)) do not limit the objects that can be deserialized.
