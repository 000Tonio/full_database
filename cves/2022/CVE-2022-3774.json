An environment variable exposed to the user is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The vulnerable environment variable uses untrusted data. Tainted data used in the environment variables is not properly validated. For instance boundary checking is not done before copying the input data to a buffer.","related_weakness":["118","119","120","20","302","680","697","733","74","99"],"solutions":"Do not expose environment variable to the user. Do not use untrusted data in your environment variables. Use a language or compiler that performs automatic bounds checking There are tools such as Sharefuzz [R.10.3] which is an environment variable fuzzer for Unix that support loading a shared library. You can use Sharefuzz to determine if you are exposing an environment variable vulnerable to buffer overflow.","summary":"This attack pattern involves causing a buffer overflow through manipulation of environment variables. Once the attacker finds that they can modify an environment variable, they may try to overflow associated buffers. This attack leverages implicit trust often placed in environment variables."},{"id":"75","name":"Manipulating Writeable Configuration Files","prerequisites":"Configuration files must be modifiable by the attacker","related_weakness":["346","349","353","354","713","77","99"],"solutions":"Design: Enforce principle of least privilege Design: Backup copies of all configuration files Implementation: Integrity monitoring for configuration files Implementation: Enforce audit logging on code and configuration promotion procedures.
