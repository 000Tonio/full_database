Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-4302","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-01-09T19:52:00","references":["https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/b7707a15-0987-4051-a8ac-7be2424bcb01"],"summary":"The White Label CMS WordPress plugin before 2.5 unserializes user input provided via the settings, which could allow high-privilege users such as admin to perform PHP Object Injection when a suitable gadget is present.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:videousermanuals:white_label_cms:-:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:videousermanuals:white_label_cms:-:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:videousermanuals:white_label_cms:2.2.9:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:videousermanuals:white_label_cms:2.2.9:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:videousermanuals:white_label_cms:-:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:videousermanuals:white_label_cms:2.2.9:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"]}
