A feature was introduced in version 3.1 of the Paragon Active Assurance Control Center which allows users to selective share account data using a unique identifier. Knowing the proper format of the URL and the identifier of an existing object in an application it is possible to get access to that object without being logged in, even if the object is not shared, resulting in the opportunity for malicious exfiltration of user data. Note that the Paragon Active Assurance Control Center SaaS offering is not affected by this issue. This issue affects Juniper Networks Paragon Active Assurance version 3.1.0.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:juniper:paragon_active_assurance_control_center:3.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:juniper:paragon_active_assurance_control_center:3.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:juniper:paragon_active_assurance_control_center:3.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
