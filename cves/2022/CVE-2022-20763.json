Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.5,"cvss-time":"2022-04-14T15:11:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-20763","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-04-14T15:11:00","references":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-webex-java-MVX6crH9"],"summary":"A vulnerability in the login authorization components of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary Java code.
