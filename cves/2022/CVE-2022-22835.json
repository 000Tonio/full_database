If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":3.5,"cvss-time":"2022-09-03T03:55:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-22835","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-09-03T03:55:00","references":["https://labs.yarix.com/advisories/cve-2022-22835/","https://overit.us/products/geocall/","https://labs.yarix.com/2022/03/overit-framework-xslt-injection-and-xxe-cve-2022-22834-cve-2022-22835/"],"summary":"An issue was discovered in OverIT Geocall before version 8.0.
