Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-33315","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-07-27T19:03:00","references":["https://jvn.jp/vu/JVNVU96480474/index.html","https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/en/psirt/vulnerability/pdf/2022-008_en.pdf"],"summary":"Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in ICONICS GENESIS64 versions 10.97.1 and prior and Mitsubishi Electric MC Works64 versions 4.04E (10.95.210.01) and prior allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute an arbitrary malicious code by leading a user to load a monitoring screen file including malicious XAML codes.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:iconics:genesis64:10.97.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:iconics:genesis64:10.97.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:iconics:genesis64:10.97:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:iconics:genesis64:10.97:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mitsubishielectric:mc_works64:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mitsubishielectric:mc_works64:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mitsubishielectric:mc_works64:10.95.208.31:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mitsubishielectric:mc_works64:10.95.208.31:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:iconics:genesis64:10.97.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:iconics:genesis64:10.97:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:mitsubishielectric:mc_works64:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:mitsubishielectric:mc_works64:10.95.208.31:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
