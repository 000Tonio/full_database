If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-25628","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-12-21T16:40:00","references":["https://support.broadcom.com/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/21136"],"summary":"An authenticated user can perform XML eXternal Entity injection in Management Console in Symantec Identity Manager 14.4","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:symantec_identity_governance_and_administration:14.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:symantec_identity_governance_and_administration:14.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:symantec_identity_governance_and_administration:14.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:symantec_identity_governance_and_administration:14.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:symantec_identity_governance_and_administration:14.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:broadcom:symantec_identity_governance_and_administration:14.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
