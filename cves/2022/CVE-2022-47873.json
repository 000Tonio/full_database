If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-47873","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-02-08T01:56:00","references":["https://fordefence.com/cve-2022-47873-keos-software-xx/"],"summary":"Netcad KEOS 1.0 is vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) resulting in SSRF with XXE (remote).","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:netcad:keos:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:netcad:keos:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:netcad:keos:1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
