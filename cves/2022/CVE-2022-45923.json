Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-45923","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-01-30T16:24:00","references":["https://sec-consult.com/vulnerability-lab/advisory/pre-authenticated-remote-code-execution-in-csexe-opentext-server-component/","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2023/Jan/10","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/170613/OpenText-Extended-ECM-22.3-cs.exe-Remote-Code-Execution.html"],"summary":"An issue was discovered in OpenText Content Suite Platform 22.1 (16.2.19.1803).
