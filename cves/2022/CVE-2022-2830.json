Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-2830","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-09-09T16:02:00","references":["https://www.bitdefender.com/support/security-advisories/deserialization-of-untrusted-data-in-gravityzone-console-va-10573"],"summary":"Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in the message processing component of Bitdefender GravityZone Console allows an attacker to pass unsafe commands to the environment.
