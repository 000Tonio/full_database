Injection of a malicious payload within the RelayState= parameter of the HTTP request body results in the hijacking of the form action. Form-action hijacking vulnerabilities arise when an application places user-supplied input into the action URL of an HTML form. An attacker can use this vulnerability to construct a URL that, if visited by another application user, will modify the action URL of a form to point to the attacker's server.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cherwell:cherwell_service_management:10.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cherwell:cherwell_service_management:10.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:cherwell:cherwell_service_management:10.2.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
