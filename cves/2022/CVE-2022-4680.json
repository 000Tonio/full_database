Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-4680","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-02-06T22:23:00","references":["https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/f4197386-975d-4e53-8fc9-9425732da9af"],"summary":"The Revive Old Posts WordPress plugin before 9.0.11 unserializes user input provided via the settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform PHP Object Injection when a suitable gadget is present.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:revive:revive_old_posts:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:revive:revive_old_posts:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:revive:revive_old_posts:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"]}
