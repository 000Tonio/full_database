Some applications include APIs that are intended to allow an administrator to test and refine their domain. These APIs should usually be disabled once a system enters a production environment. Testing APIs may expose a great deal of diagnostic information intended to aid an administrator, but which can also be used by an attacker to further refine their attack. Moreover, testing APIs may not have adequate security controls or may not have undergone rigorous testing since they were not intended for use in production environments. As such, they may have many flaws and vulnerabilities that would allow an attacker to severely disrupt a target."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-489","id":"CVE-2022-32760","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-10-26T15:45:00","references":["https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2022-1555"],"summary":"A denial of service vulnerability exists in the XCMD doDebug functionality of Abode Systems, Inc. iota All-In-One Security Kit 6.9X and 6.9Z.
