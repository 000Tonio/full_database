Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":3.6,"cvss-time":"2022-06-24T16:50:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:N","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-29615","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-06-24T16:50:00","references":["https://www.sap.com/documents/2022/02/fa865ea4-167e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html","https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3202846"],"summary":"SAP NetWeaver Developer Studio (NWDS) - version 7.50, is based on Eclipse, which contains the logging framework log4j in version 1.x.
