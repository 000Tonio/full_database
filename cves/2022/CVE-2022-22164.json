A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2022-01-26T02:21:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N","cwe":"CWE-665","id":"CVE-2022-22164","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-01-26T02:21:00","references":["https://kb.juniper.net/JSA11272"],"summary":"An Improper Initialization vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved may cause a commit operation for disabling the telnet service to not take effect as expected, resulting in the telnet service staying enabled.
