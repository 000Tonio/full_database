The adversary can leverage a race condition by \"running the race\", modifying the resource and modifying the normal execution flow.

A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":4.4,"cvss-time":"2022-07-05T19:43:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2022-33915","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-07-05T19:43:00","references":["https://alas.aws.amazon.com/ALAS-2022-1601.html","https://alas.aws.amazon.com/AL2/ALAS-2022-1806.html"],"summary":"Versions of the Amazon AWS Apache Log4j hotpatch package before log4j-cve-2021-44228-hotpatch-1.3.5 are affected by a race condition that could lead to a local privilege escalation. This Hotpatch package is not a replacement for updating to a log4j version that mitigates CVE-2021-44228 or CVE-2021-45046; it provides a temporary mitigation to CVE-2021-44228 by hotpatching the local Java virtual machines. To do so, it iterates through all running Java processes, performs several checks, and executes the Java virtual machine with the same permissions and capabilities as the running process to load the hotpatch. A local user could cause the hotpatch script to execute a binary with elevated privileges by running a custom java process that performs exec() of an SUID binary after the hotpatch has observed the process path and before it has observed its effective user ID.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:amazon:hotpatch:-:*:*:*:*:log4j:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:amazon:hotpatch:-:*:*:*:*:log4j:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:amazon:hotpatch:1.1-12:*:*:*:*:log4j:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:amazon:hotpatch:1.1-12:*:*:*:*:log4j:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:amazon:hotpatch:1.1-16:*:*:*:*:log4j:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:amazon:hotpatch:1.1-16:*:*:*:*:log4j:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:amazon:hotpatch:-:*:*:*:*:log4j:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:amazon:hotpatch:1.1-12:*:*:*:*:log4j:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:amazon:hotpatch:1.1-16:*:*:*:*:log4j:*:*"]}
