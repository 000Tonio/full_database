XML Routing Detour Attacks are Man in the Middle type attacks. The attacker compromises or inserts an intermediate system in the processing of the XML message. For example, WS-Routing can be used to specify a series of nodes or intermediaries through which content is passed. If any of the intermediate nodes in this route are compromised by an attacker they could be used for a routing detour attack. From the compromised system the attacker is able to route the XML process to other nodes of his or her choice and modify the responses so that the normal chain of processing is unaware of the interception. This system can forward the message to an outside entity and hide the forwarding and processing from the legitimate processing systems by altering the header information."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2022-05-10T17:42:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-610","id":"CVE-2022-24900","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-05-10T17:42:00","references":["https://github.com/onlaj/Piano-LED-Visualizer/commit/3f10602323cd8184e1c69a76b815655597bf0ee5","https://github.com/onlaj/Piano-LED-Visualizer/security/advisories/GHSA-g78x-q3x8-r6m4","https://github.com/onlaj/Piano-LED-Visualizer/blob/6a732caa812c83a807c711f3d091af99209cae7b/webinterface/views_api.py#L970","https://github.com/onlaj/Piano-LED-Visualizer/pull/351","https://github.com/onlaj/Piano-LED-Visualizer/issues/350"],"summary":"Piano LED Visualizer is software that allows LED lights to light up as a person plays a piano connected to a computer. Version 1.3 and prior are vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The `os.path.join` call is unsafe for use with untrusted input. When the `os.path.join` call encounters an absolute path, it ignores all the parameters it has encountered till that point and starts working with the new absolute path. Since the \"malicious\" parameter represents an absolute path, the result of `os.path.join` ignores the static directory completely. Hence, untrusted input is passed via the `os.path.join` call to `flask.send_file` can lead to path traversal attacks. A patch with a fix is available on the `master` branch of the GitHub repository. This can also be fixed by preventing flow of untrusted data to the vulnerable `send_file` function. In case the application logic necessiates this behaviour, one can either use the `flask.safe_join` to join untrusted paths or replace `flask.send_file` calls with `flask.send_from_directory` calls.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:piano_led_visualizer_project:piano_led_visualizer:1.00:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:piano_led_visualizer_project:piano_led_visualizer:1.00:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:piano_led_visualizer_project:piano_led_visualizer:1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:piano_led_visualizer_project:piano_led_visualizer:1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:piano_led_visualizer_project:piano_led_visualizer:1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:piano_led_visualizer_project:piano_led_visualizer:1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:piano_led_visualizer_project:piano_led_visualizer:1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:piano_led_visualizer_project:piano_led_visualizer:1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:piano_led_visualizer_project:piano_led_visualizer:1.00:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:piano_led_visualizer_project:piano_led_visualizer:1.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:piano_led_visualizer_project:piano_led_visualizer:1.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:piano_led_visualizer_project:piano_led_visualizer:1.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
