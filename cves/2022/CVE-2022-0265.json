If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2022-04-29T16:50:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-0265","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-04-29T16:50:00","references":["https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/commit/4d6b666cd0291abd618c3b95cdbb51aa4208e748","https://huntr.dev/bounties/d63972a2-b910-480a-a86b-d1f75d24d563"],"summary":"Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference in GitHub repository hazelcast/hazelcast in 5.1-BETA-1.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:hazelcast:hazelcast:5.1:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:hazelcast:hazelcast:5.1:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:hazelcast:hazelcast:5.1:beta1:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
