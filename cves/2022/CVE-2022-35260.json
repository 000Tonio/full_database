If that file endsin a line with 4095 consecutive non-white space letters and no newline, curlwould first read past the end of the stack-based buffer, and if the readworks, write a zero byte beyond its boundary.This will in most cases cause a segfault or similar, but circumstances might also cause different outcomes.If a malicious user can provide a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise affect its contents, this flaw could be used as denial-of-service.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:haxx:curl:7.84.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:haxx:curl:7.84.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:haxx:curl:7.85.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:haxx:curl:7.85.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:haxx:curl:7.84.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:haxx:curl:7.85.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
