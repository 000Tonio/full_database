If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2022-07-20T18:09:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-35168","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-07-20T18:09:00","references":["https://www.sap.com/documents/2022/02/fa865ea4-167e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html","https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3211203"],"summary":"Due to improper input sanitization of XML input in SAP Business One - version 10.0, an attacker can perform a denial-of-service attack rendering the system temporarily inoperative.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:business_one:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:business_one:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sap:business_one:10.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
