Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-4890","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-01-24T16:19:00","references":["https://github.com/abhilash1985/PredictApp/commit/b067372f3ee26fe1b657121f0f41883ff4461a06","https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.218387","https://vuldb.com/?id.218387","https://github.com/abhilash1985/PredictApp/pull/73"],"summary":"A vulnerability, which was classified as critical, has been found in abhilash1985 PredictApp. This issue affects some unknown processing of the file config/initializers/new_framework_defaults_7_0.rb of the component Cookie Handler.
