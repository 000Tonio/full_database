If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2022-05-10T12:47:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-24898","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-05-10T12:47:00","references":["https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/commit/947e8921ebd95462d5a7928f397dd1b64f77c7d5","https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-18946","https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-commons/security/advisories/GHSA-m2r5-4w96-qxg5"],"summary":"org.xwiki.commons:xwiki-commons-xml is a common module used by other XWiki top level projects. Starting in version 2.7 and prior to versions 12.10.10, 13.4.4, and 13.8-rc-1, it is possible for a script to access any file accessing to the user running XWiki application server with XML External Entity Injection through the XML script service.
