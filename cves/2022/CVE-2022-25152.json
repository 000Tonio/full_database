It is possible to require a mandatory approval process. Due to a vulnerability in the approval process, present in any version prior to 6.35.37347.20040, a malicious actor (with a valid session token) can create a procedure, bypass approval, and execute the procedure. This results in the ability for any user with a valid session token to perform arbitrary code execution and full system take-over on all agents.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:itarian:saas_service_desk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:itarian:saas_service_desk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:itarian:on-premise:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:itarian:on-premise:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:itarian:saas_service_desk:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:itarian:on-premise:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
