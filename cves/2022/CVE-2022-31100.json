When parsing untrusted rulex expressions, rulex may crash, possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when the expression contains a multi-byte UTF-8 code point in a string literal or after a backslash, because rulex tries to slice into the code point and panics as a result. This is a security concern for you, if your service parses untrusted rulex expressions (expressions provided by an untrusted user), and your service becomes unavailable when the thread running rulex panics. The crashes are fixed in version **0.4.3**. Affected users are advised to update to this version. The only known workaround for this issue is to assume that regular expression parsing will panic and to add logic to catch panics.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:pomsky-lang:pomsky:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:pomsky-lang:pomsky:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:pomsky-lang:pomsky:*:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"]}
