One example could be harvesting lists of usernames or userIDs for the purpose of sending spam messages to those users. One example of this type of attack involves the adversary creating an event within the sub-application. Assume the adversary hosts a \"virtual sale\" of rare items. As other users enter the event, the attacker records via MITM proxy the user_ids and usernames of everyone who attends. The adversary would then be able to spam those users within the application using an automated script."},{"id":"477","name":"Signature Spoofing by Mixing Signed and Unsigned Content","prerequisites":"Signer and recipient are using complex data storage structures that allow for a mix between signed and unsigned data Recipient is using signature verification software that does not maintain separation between signed and unsigned data once the signature has been verified.","related_weakness":["311","319","693"],"solutions":"Ensure the application is fully patched and does not allow the processing of unsigned data as if it is signed data.","summary":"An attacker exploits the underlying complexity of a data structure that allows for both signed and unsigned content, to cause unsigned data to be processed as though it were signed data."},{"id":"65","name":"Sniff Application Code","prerequisites":"The attacker must have the ability to place himself in the communication path between the client and server. The targeted application must receive some application code from the server; for example, dynamic updates, patches, applets or scripts. The attacker must be able to employ a sniffer on the network without being detected.","related_weakness":["311","318","319","693","719"],"solutions":"Design: Encrypt all communication between the client and server. Implementation: Use SSL, SSH, SCP. Operation: Use \"ifconfig/ipconfig\" or other tools to detect the sniffer installed in the network.","summary":"An adversary passively sniffs network communications and captures application code bound for an authorized client. Once obtained, they can use it as-is, or through reverse-engineering glean sensitive information or exploit the trust relationship between the client and server. Such code may belong to a dynamic update to the client, a patch being applied to a client component or any such interaction where the client is authorized to communicate with the server."},{"id":"102","name":"Session Sidejacking","prerequisites":"An attacker and the victim are both using the same WiFi network. The victim has an active session with a target system. The victim is not using a secure channel to communicate with the target system (e.g. SSL, VPN, etc.) The victim initiated communication with a target system that requires transfer of the session token or the target application uses AJAX and thereby periodically \"rings home\" asynchronously using the session token","related_weakness":["294","319","522","523","614"],"solutions":"Make sure that HTTPS is used to communicate with the target system. Alternatively, use VPN if possible. It is important to ensure that all communication between the client and the server happens via an encrypted secure channel. Modify the session token with each transmission and protect it with cryptography. Add the idea of request sequencing that gives the server an ability to detect replay attacks.","summary":"Session sidejacking takes advantage of an unencrypted communication channel between a victim and target system. The attacker sniffs traffic on a network looking for session tokens in unencrypted traffic. Once a session token is captured, the attacker performs malicious actions by using the stolen token with the targeted application to impersonate the victim. This attack is a specific method of session hijacking, which is exploiting a valid session token to gain unauthorized access to a target system or information. Other methods to perform a session hijacking are session fixation, cross-site scripting, or compromising a user or server machine and stealing the session token."},{"id":"117","name":"Interception","prerequisites":"The target must transmit data over a medium that is accessible to the adversary.","related_weakness":["319"],"solutions":"Leverage encryption to encode the transmission of data thus making it accessible only to authorized parties.","summary":"An adversary monitors data streams to or from the target for information gathering purposes. This attack may be undertaken to solely gather sensitive information or to support a further attack against the target. This attack pattern can involve sniffing network traffic as well as other types of data streams (e.g. radio). The adversary can attempt to initiate the establishment of a data stream or passively observe the communications as they unfold. In all variants of this attack, the adversary is not the intended recipient of the data stream. In contrast to other means of gathering information (e.g., targeting data leaks), the adversary must actively position himself so as to observe explicit data channels (e.g. network traffic) and read the content. However, this attack differs from a Man-In-the-Middle (MITM) attack, as the adversary does not alter the content of the communications nor forward data to the intended recipient."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-319","id":"CVE-2022-2003","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-09-06T23:50:00","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-167-03","https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/advisories/icsa-22-167-02"],"summary":"AutomationDirect DirectLOGIC is vulnerable to a specifically crafted serial message to the CPU serial port that will cause the PLC to respond with the PLC password in cleartext.
