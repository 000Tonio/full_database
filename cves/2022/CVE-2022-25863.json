Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2022-06-17T18:40:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-25863","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-06-17T18:40:00","references":["https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/35830","https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/pull/35830/commits/f214eb0694c61e348b2751cecd1aace2046bc46e","https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EoCzbwTWOM8-fjvwMbH3bqcZ2iKksxTW/view?usp=sharing","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-GATSBYPLUGINMDX-2405699"],"summary":"The package gatsby-plugin-mdx before 2.14.1, from 3.0.0 and before 3.15.2 are vulnerable to Deserialization of Untrusted Data when passing input through to the gray-matter package, due to its default configurations that are missing input sanitization. Exploiting this vulnerability is possible when passing input in both webpack (MDX files in src/pages or MDX file imported as a component in frontend / React code) and data mode (querying MDX nodes via GraphQL). Workaround: If an older version of gatsby-plugin-mdx must be used, input passed into the plugin should be sanitized ahead of processing.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:gatsbyjs:gatsby:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:gatsbyjs:gatsby:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:gatsbyjs:gatsby:*:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"]}
