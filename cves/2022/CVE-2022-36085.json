The Rego compiler provides a (deprecated) `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function, which allows users to provide a set of built-in functions that should be deemed unsafe â€” and as such rejected â€” by the compiler if encountered in the policy compilation stage. A bypass of this protection has been found, where the use of the `with` keyword to mock such a built-in function (a feature introduced in OPA v0.40.0), isnâ€™t taken into account by `WithUnsafeBuiltins`. Multiple conditions need to be met in order to create an adverse effect. Version 0.43.1 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, avoid using the `WithUnsafeBuiltins` function and use the `capabilities` feature instead.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:openpolicyagent:open_policy_agent:0.40.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:openpolicyagent:open_policy_agent:0.40.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:openpolicyagent:open_policy_agent:0.41.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:openpolicyagent:open_policy_agent:0.41.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:openpolicyagent:open_policy_agent:0.42.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:openpolicyagent:open_policy_agent:0.42.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:openpolicyagent:open_policy_agent:0.42.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:openpolicyagent:open_policy_agent:0.42.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:openpolicyagent:open_policy_agent:0.42.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:openpolicyagent:open_policy_agent:0.42.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:openpolicyagent:open_policy_agent:0.40.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openpolicyagent:open_policy_agent:0.41.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openpolicyagent:open_policy_agent:0.42.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openpolicyagent:open_policy_agent:0.42.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openpolicyagent:open_policy_agent:0.42.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
