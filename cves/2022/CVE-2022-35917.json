When a Solana Pay transaction is located using a reference key, it may be checked to represent a transfer of the desired amount to the recipient, using the supplied `validateTransfer` function. An edge case regarding this mechanism could cause the validation logic to validate multiple transfers. This issue has been patched as of version `0.2.1`. Users of the Solana Pay SDK should upgrade to it. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:solana:pay:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:solana:pay:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:solana:pay:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
