The default security setting must be to deny access and then grant access only to those resources intended by business logic.","summary":"In applications, particularly web applications, access to functionality is mitigated by an authorization framework. This framework maps Access Control Lists (ACLs) to elements of the application's functionality; particularly URL's for web apps. In the case that the administrator failed to specify an ACL for a particular element, an attacker may be able to access it with impunity. An attacker with the ability to access functionality not properly constrained by ACLs can obtain sensitive information and possibly compromise the entire application. Such an attacker can access resources that must be available only to users at a higher privilege level, can access management sections of the application, or can run queries for data that they otherwise not supposed to."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2022-04-19T15:30:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-434","id":"CVE-2022-24837","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-04-19T15:30:00","references":["https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/security/advisories/GHSA-q6vv-2q26-j7rx","https://github.com/node-formidable/formidable/issues/808","https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/9e2f9e21e904c4a319e84265da7ef03b0a8e343a"],"summary":"HedgeDoc is an open-source, web-based, self-hosted, collaborative markdown editor. Images uploaded with HedgeDoc version 1.9.1 and later have an enumerable filename after the upload, resulting in potential information leakage of uploaded documents. This is especially relevant for private notes and affects all upload backends, except Lutim and imgur. This issue is patched in version 1.9.3 by replacing the filename generation with UUIDv4. If you cannot upgrade to HedgeDoc 1.9.3, it is possible to block POST requests to `/uploadimage`, which will disable future uploads.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:hedgedoc:hedgedoc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:hedgedoc:hedgedoc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:hedgedoc:hedgedoc:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
