A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":6.9,"cvss-time":"2022-08-24T18:35:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2022-26362","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2022-08-24T18:35:00","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/06/09/3","https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-401.txt","http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-401.html","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/OH65U6FTTB5MLH5A6Q3TW7KVCGOG4MYI/","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167718/Xen-TLB-Flush-Bypass.html","https://www.debian.org/security/2022/dsa-5184","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RKRXZ4LHGCGMOG24ZCEJNY6R2BTS4S2Q/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202208-23"],"summary":"x86 pv: Race condition in typeref acquisition Xen maintains a type reference count for pages, in addition to a regular reference count.

Unfortunately, the logic for acquiring a type reference has a race condition, whereby a safely TLB flush is issued too early and creates a window where the guest can re-establish the read/write mapping before writeability is prohibited.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:*:*:*:*:*:*:x86:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:*:*:*:*:*:*:x86:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:36:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:36:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:xen:xen:*:*:*:*:*:*:x86:*","cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:35:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:fedoraproject:fedora:36:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:o:debian:debian_linux:11.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
