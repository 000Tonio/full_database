If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-45194","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-11-16T18:16:00","references":["https://zigrin.com/advisories/cbrn-analysis-external-xml-entity-injection/"],"summary":"CBRN-Analysis before 22 allows XXE attacks via am mws XML document, leading to NTLMv2-SSP hash disclosure.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:bruhn-newtech:cbrn-analysis:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:bruhn-newtech:cbrn-analysis:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:bruhn-newtech:cbrn-analysis:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
