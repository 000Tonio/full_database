If an authorized user has accessed a publicly available B420 product using valid credentials, an insider attacker can gain access to the same panel without requiring any sort of authorization. The B420 module was already obsolete at the time this vulnerability was found (The End of Life announcement was made in 2013).","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:bosch:b420_firmware:02.02.0001:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:bosch:b420_firmware:02.02.0001:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:bosch:b420:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:bosch:b420:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:bosch:b420_firmware:02.02.0001:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
