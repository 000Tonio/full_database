This framework maps Access Control Lists (ACLs) to elements of the application's functionality; particularly URL's for web apps. In the case that the administrator failed to specify an ACL for a particular element, an attacker may be able to access it with impunity. An attacker with the ability to access functionality not properly constrained by ACLs can obtain sensitive information and possibly compromise the entire application. Such an attacker can access resources that must be available only to users at a higher privilege level, can access management sections of the application, or can run queries for data that they otherwise not supposed to."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2022-06-23T18:26:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:N/I:P/A:N","cwe":"CWE-434","id":"CVE-2022-31041","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-06-23T18:26:00","references":["https://github.com/open-formulieren/open-forms/security/advisories/GHSA-h85r-xv4w-cg8g","https://github.com/open-formulieren/open-forms/commit/0978a29e821a7228c5d46c0527c3e925eb91b071"],"summary":"Open Forms is an application for creating and publishing smart forms. Open Forms supports file uploads as one of the form field types. These fields can be configured to allow only certain file extensions to be uploaded by end users (e.g. only PDF / Excel / ...). The input validation of uploaded files is insufficient in versions prior to 1.0.9 and 1.1.1. Users could alter or strip file extensions to bypass this validation. This results in files being uploaded to the server that are of a different file type than indicated by the file name extension. These files may be downloaded (manually or automatically) by staff and/or other applications for further processing. Malicious files can therefore find their way into internal/trusted networks. Versions 1.0.9 and 1.1.1 contain patches for this issue. As a workaround, an API gateway or intrusion detection solution in front of open-forms may be able to scan for and block malicious content before it reaches the Open Forms application.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.0:rc0:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.0:rc0:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.0:rc3:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.0:rc3:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.0:rc4:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.0:rc4:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.1.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.1.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.1.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.1.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.1.0:rc0:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.1.0:rc0:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.0:rc0:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.0:rc2:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.0:rc3:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.0:rc4:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.7:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.0.8:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.1.0:-:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.1.0:rc1:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:maykinmedia:open_forms:1.1.0:rc0:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
