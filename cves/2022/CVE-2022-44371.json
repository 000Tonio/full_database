Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-44371","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-12-09T14:53:00","references":["https://github.com/java-aodeng/hope-boot/issues/83"],"summary":"hope-boot 1.0.0 has a deserialization vulnerability that can cause Remote Code Execution (RCE).","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:hope-boot_project:hope-boot:1.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:hope-boot_project:hope-boot:1.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:hope-boot_project:hope-boot:1.0.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
