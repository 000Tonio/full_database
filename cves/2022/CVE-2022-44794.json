Management protocol has a flow which allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary Bash code with root privileges. The command that sets the hostname doesn't validate input parameters. As a result, arbitrary data goes directly to the Bash interpreter. An attacker would need credentials to exploit this vulnerability. This is fixed in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.13.1611.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:objectfirst:object_first:1.0.7.712:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:objectfirst:object_first:1.0.7.712:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:objectfirst:object_first:1.0.7.712:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
