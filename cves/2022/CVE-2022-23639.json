A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2023-02-10T16:28:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2022-23639","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2023-02-10T16:28:00","references":["https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/releases/tag/crossbeam-utils-0.8.7","https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/security/advisories/GHSA-qc84-gqf4-9926","https://github.com/crossbeam-rs/crossbeam/pull/781"],"summary":"crossbeam-utils provides atomics, synchronization primitives, scoped threads, and other utilities for concurrent programming in Rust. crossbeam-utils prior to version 0.8.7 incorrectly assumed that the alignment of `{i,u}64` was always the same as `Atomic{I,U}64`. However, the alignment of `{i,u}64` on a 32-bit target can be smaller than `Atomic{I,U}64`. This can cause unaligned memory accesses and data race. Crates using `fetch_*` methods with `AtomicCell<{i,u}64>` are affected by this issue. 32-bit targets without `Atomic{I,U}64` and 64-bit targets are not affected by this issue. This has been fixed in crossbeam-utils 0.8.7. There are currently no known workarounds.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:-:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:-:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.1.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.1.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.2.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.2.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.3.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.3.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.4.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.4.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.4.1:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.4.1:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.4.3:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.4.3:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.4.4:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.4.4:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.5.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.5.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.6.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.6.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.7.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.7.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.7.1:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.7.1:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.7.2:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.7.2:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.7.3:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.7.3:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.7.4:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.7.4:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.8.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.8.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.8.1:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.8.1:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.8.3:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.8.3:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.8.4:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.8.4:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.8.5:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.8.5:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.8.6:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.8.6:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:-:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.1.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.2.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.3.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.4.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.4.1:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.4.3:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.4.4:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.5.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.6.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.7.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.7.1:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.7.2:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.7.3:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.7.4:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.8.0:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.8.1:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.8.3:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.8.4:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.8.5:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:crossbeam_project:crossbeam:0.8.6:*:*:*:*:rust:*:*"]}
