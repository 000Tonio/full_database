Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2022-03-24T02:19:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-0749","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-03-24T02:19:00","references":["https://github.com/SinGooCMS/SinGooCMSUtility/issues/1","https://github.com/SinGooCMS/SinGooCMSUtility/blob/master/SinGooCMS.Utility/Net/SocketClient.cs","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-DOTNET-SINGOOCMSUTILITY-2312979"],"summary":"This affects all versions of package SinGooCMS.Utility.
