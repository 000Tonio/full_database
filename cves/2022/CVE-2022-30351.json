In cases where PDF text objects are present it is possible to copy-paste redacted information into the system clipboard. Once a document is \"locked\" and marked for redaction once, all redactions performed after this feature is triggered are vulnerable.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
