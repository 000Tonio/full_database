If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2022-04-21T01:50:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-0221","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-04-21T01:50:00","references":["https://www.se.com/ww/en/download/document/SEVD-2022-087-01/"],"summary":"A CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference vulnerability exists that could result in information disclosure when opening a malicious solution file provided by an attacker with SCADAPack Workbench.
