If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-27873","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-08-05T18:49:00","references":["https://www.autodesk.com/trust/security-advisories/adsk-sa-2022-0013"],"summary":"An attacker can force the victim’s device to perform arbitrary HTTP requests in WAN through a malicious SVG file being parsed by Autodesk Fusion 360’s document parser.
