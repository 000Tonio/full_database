ADS allows multiple \"files\" to be stored in one directory entry referenced as filename:streamname. One or more alternate data streams may be stored in any file or directory. Normal Microsoft utilities do not show the presence of an ADS stream attached to a file. The additional space for the ADS is not recorded in the displayed file size. The additional space for ADS is accounted for in the used space on the volume. An ADS can be any type of file. ADS are copied by standard Microsoft utilities between NTFS volumes. ADS can be used by an attacker or intruder to hide tools, scripts, and data from detection by normal system utilities. Many anti-virus programs do not check for or scan ADS. Windows Vista does have a switch (-R) on the command line DIR command that will display alternate streams."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2022-04-08T17:10:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-212","id":"CVE-2022-24798","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-04-08T17:10:00","references":["https://github.com/irrdnet/irrd/commit/fdffaf8dd71713f06e99dff417e6aa1e6fa84b70","https://github.com/irrdnet/irrd/security/advisories/GHSA-cqxx-66wh-8pjw","https://github.com/irrdnet/irrd/commit/0e41bae8d3d27316381a2fc7b466597230e35ec6"],"summary":"Internet Routing Registry daemon version 4 is an IRR database server, processing IRR objects in the RPSL format. IRRd did not always filter password hashes in query responses relating to `mntner` objects and database exports. This may have allowed adversaries to retrieve some of these hashes, perform a brute-force search for the clear-text passphrase, and use these to make unauthorised changes to affected IRR objects. This issue only affected instances that process password hashes, which means it is limited to IRRd instances that serve authoritative databases. IRRd instances operating solely as mirrors of other IRR databases are not affected. This has been fixed in IRRd 4.2.3 and the main branch. Versions in the 4.1.x series never were affected. Users of the 4.2.x series are strongly recommended to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:internet_routing_registry_daemon_project:internet_routing_registry_daemon:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:internet_routing_registry_daemon_project:internet_routing_registry_daemon:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:internet_routing_registry_daemon_project:internet_routing_registry_daemon:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
