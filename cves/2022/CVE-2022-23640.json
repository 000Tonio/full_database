If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2022-03-09T18:01:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-23640","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-03-09T18:01:00","references":["https://github.com/monitorjbl/excel-streaming-reader/security/advisories/GHSA-xvm2-9xvc-hx7f","https://github.com/monitorjbl/excel-streaming-reader/commit/0749c7b9709db078ccdeada16d46a34bc2910c73"],"summary":"Excel-Streaming-Reader is an easy-to-use implementation of a streaming Excel reader using Apache POI.
