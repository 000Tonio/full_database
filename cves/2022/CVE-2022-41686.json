The impact depends on the privileges of the attacker. The unprivileged process run on the device could read out-of-bound memory leading sensitive to information disclosure. The processes with system user UID run on the device would be able to write out-of-bound memory which could lead to unspecified memory corruption.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:openharmony:openharmony:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:openharmony:openharmony:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:openharmony:openharmony:*:*:*:*:long_term_support:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:openharmony:openharmony:*:*:*:*:long_term_support:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:openharmony:openharmony:*:*:*:*:-:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:openharmony:openharmony:*:*:*:*:long_term_support:*:*:*"]}
