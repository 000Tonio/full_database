Because of that, an attacker could create a socket and connect with a remote IP:port by opening a shell and getting full access to the system. The exploit affects daemons dbmng and logsrv that are running on ports 8000 and 8001 by default.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:grandstream:gds3710_firmware:1.0.11.13:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:grandstream:gds3710_firmware:1.0.11.13:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:grandstream:gds3710:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:grandstream:gds3710:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:grandstream:gds3710_firmware:1.0.11.13:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
