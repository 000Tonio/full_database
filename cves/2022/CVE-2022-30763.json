As a consequence, an adversary is able to write past the boundaries of allocated buffer regions in memory, causing a program crash or potentially redirection of execution as per the adversaries' choice."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2022-10-12T15:32:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-129","id":"CVE-2022-30763","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-10-12T15:32:00","references":["https://github.com/janet-lang/janet/releases/tag/v1.22.0","https://github.com/janet-lang/janet/compare/v1.21.1...v1.22.0","https://blog.convisoappsec.com/en/bug-hunting-in-the-janet-language-interpreter/"],"summary":"Janet before 1.22.0 mishandles arrays.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:janet-lang:janet:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:janet-lang:janet:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:janet-lang:janet:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
