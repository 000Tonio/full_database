Implement a password throttling mechanism. This mechanism should take into account both the IP address and the log in name of the user. Put together a strong password policy and make sure that all user created passwords comply with it. Alternatively automatically generate strong passwords for users. Passwords need to be recycled to prevent aging, that is every once in a while a new password must be chosen.","summary":"An adversary may try certain common or default usernames and passwords to gain access into the system and perform unauthorized actions. An adversary may try an intelligent brute force using empty passwords, known vendor default credentials, as well as a dictionary of common usernames and passwords. Many vendor products come preconfigured with default (and thus well-known) usernames and passwords that should be deleted prior to usage in a production environment. It is a common mistake to forget to remove these default login credentials. Another problem is that users would pick very simple (common) passwords (e.g. \"secret\" or \"password\") that make it easier for the attacker to gain access to the system compared to using a brute force attack or even a dictionary attack using a full dictionary."},{"id":"191","name":"Read Sensitive Strings Within an Executable","prerequisites":"Access to a binary or executable such that it can be analyzed by various utilities.","related_weakness":["798"],"solutions":"","summary":"An adversary engages in activities to discover any sensitive strings are present within the compiled code of an executable, such as literal ASCII strings within the file itself, or possibly strings hard-coded into particular routines that can be revealed by code refactoring methods including static and dynamic analysis. One specific example of a sensitive string is a hard-coded password. Typical examples of software with hard-coded passwords include server-side executables which may check for a hard-coded password or key during a user's authentication with the server. Hard-coded passwords can also be present in client-side executables which utilize the password or key when connecting to either a remote component, such as a database server, licensing server, or otherwise, or a processes on the same host that expects a key or password. When analyzing an executable the adversary may search for the presence of such strings by analyzing the byte-code of the file itself. Example utilities for revealing strings within a file include 'strings,' 'grep,' or other variants of these programs depending upon the type of operating system used. These programs can be used to dump any ASCII or UNICODE strings contained within a program. Strings can also be searched for using a hex editors by loading the binary or object code file and utilizing native search functions such as regular expressions."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-798","id":"CVE-2022-20844","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-10-05T16:21:00","references":["https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdavc-ZA5fpXX2"],"summary":"A vulnerability in authentication mechanism of Cisco Software-Defined Application Visibility and Control (SD-AVC) on Cisco vManage could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the GUI of Cisco SD-AVC using a default static username and password combination. This vulnerability exists because the GUI is accessible on self-managed cloud installations or local server installations of Cisco vManage. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing the exposed GUI of Cisco SD-AVC. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view managed device names, SD-AVC logs, and SD-AVC DNS server IP addresses.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.3.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.3.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.3.4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.3.4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.3.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.3.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.3.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.3.4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.3.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.4.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.4.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:cisco:sd-wan:20.6.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
