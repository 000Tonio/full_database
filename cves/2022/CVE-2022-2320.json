The specific flaw exists within the handling of ProcXkbSetDeviceInfo requests. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an allocated buffer. This flaw allows an attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:x.org:xorg-server:21.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:x.org:xorg-server:21.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:x.org:xorg-server:21.1.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
