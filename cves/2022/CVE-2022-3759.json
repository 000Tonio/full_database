An attacker may upload a crafted CI job artifact zip file in a project that uses dynamic child pipelines and make a sidekiq job allocate a lot of memory. In GitLab instances where Sidekiq is memory-limited, this may cause Denial of Service.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
