Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2022-07-25T09:34:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-31115","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-07-25T09:34:00","references":["https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-ruby/security/advisories/GHSA-977c-63xq-cgw3","https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-ruby/pull/77","https://staaldraad.github.io/post/2021-01-09-universal-rce-ruby-yaml-load-updated/"],"summary":"opensearch-ruby is a community-driven, open source fork of elasticsearch-ruby. In versions prior to 2.0.1 the ruby `YAML.load` function was used instead of `YAML.safe_load`. As a result opensearch-ruby 2.0.0 and prior can lead to unsafe deserialization using YAML.load if the response is of type YAML. An attacker must be in control of an opensearch server and convince the victim to connect to it in order to exploit this vulnerability. The problem has been patched in opensearch-ruby gem version 2.0.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:-:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:-:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:1.0.0:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:1.0.0:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:2.0.0:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:2.0.0:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:2.0.1:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:2.0.1:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:-:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:1.0.0:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:2.0.0:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:amazon:opensearch:2.0.1:*:*:*:*:ruby:*:*"]}
