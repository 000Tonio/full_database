In affected versions shopware would not invalidate a user session in the event of a password change. With version 5.7.7 the session validation was adjusted, so that sessions created prior to the latest password change of a customer account can't be used to login with said account. This also means, that upon a password change, all existing sessions for a given customer account are automatically considered invalid. There is no workaround for this issue.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:5.7.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:5.7.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:5.7.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:5.7.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:5.7.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:5.7.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:5.7.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:5.7.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:5.7.3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:5.7.4:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:5.7.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:shopware:shopware:5.7.6:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
