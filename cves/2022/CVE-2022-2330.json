If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-2330","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-09-15T08:15:00","references":["https://kcm.trellix.com/corporate/index?page=content&id=SB10386"],"summary":"Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference vulnerability in DLP Endpoint for Windows prior to 11.9.100 allows a remote attacker to cause the DLP Agent to access a local service that the attacker wouldn't usually have access to via a carefully constructed XML file, which the DLP Agent doesn't parse correctly.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:data_loss_prevention_endpoint:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:data_loss_prevention_endpoint:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:data_loss_prevention_endpoint:11.6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:data_loss_prevention_endpoint:11.6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:data_loss_prevention_endpoint:11.6.100.41:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:data_loss_prevention_endpoint:11.6.100.41:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:data_loss_prevention_endpoint:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:data_loss_prevention_endpoint:11.6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:mcafee:data_loss_prevention_endpoint:11.6.100.41:*:*:*:*:windows:*:*"]}
