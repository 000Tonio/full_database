Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2022-05-26T22:05:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-24108","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-05-26T22:05:00","references":["https://www.smartaddons.com/opencart-extensions/so-listing-tabs-responsive-opencart-30x-opencart-2x-module","https://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2022/May/30","https://codecanyon.net/item/so-listing-tabs-responsive-opencart-module/12388133","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/167197/OpenCart-So-Listing-Tabs-2.2.0-Unsafe-Deserialization.html"],"summary":"The Skyoftech So Listing Tabs module 2.2.0 for OpenCart allows a remote attacker to inject a serialized PHP object via the setting parameter, potentially resulting in the ability to write to files on the server, cause DoS, and achieve remote code execution because of deserialization of untrusted data.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:skyoftech:so_listing_tabs:2.2.0:*:*:*:*:opencart:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:skyoftech:so_listing_tabs:2.2.0:*:*:*:*:opencart:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:skyoftech:so_listing_tabs:2.2.0:*:*:*:*:opencart:*:*"]}
