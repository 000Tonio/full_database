Tainted data used in the environment variables is not properly validated. For instance boundary checking is not done before copying the input data to a buffer.","related_weakness":["118","119","120","20","302","680","697","733","74","99"],"solutions":"Do not expose environment variable to the user. Do not use untrusted data in your environment variables.

You can use Sharefuzz to determine if you are exposing an environment variable vulnerable to buffer overflow.","summary":"This attack pattern involves causing a buffer overflow through manipulation of environment variables. Once the attacker finds that they can modify an environment variable, they may try to overflow associated buffers.
