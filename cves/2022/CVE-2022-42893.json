Implementation: Use SSL for connections between all parties with mutual authentication.","summary":"An attacker subverts an intermediate system used to process XML content and forces the intermediate to modify and/or re-route the processing of the content. XML Routing Detour Attacks are Man in the Middle type attacks. The attacker compromises or inserts an intermediate system in the processing of the XML message. For example, WS-Routing can be used to specify a series of nodes or intermediaries through which content is passed. If any of the intermediate nodes in this route are compromised by an attacker they could be used for a routing detour attack. From the compromised system the attacker is able to route the XML process to other nodes of his or her choice and modify the responses so that the normal chain of processing is unaware of the interception. This system can forward the message to an outside entity and hide the forwarding and processing from the legitimate processing systems by altering the header information."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-610","id":"CVE-2022-42893","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-11-21T18:24:00","references":["https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/en-us/support-documentation/cybersecurity/shsa-741697"],"summary":"A vulnerability has been identified in syngo Dynamics (All versions < VA40G HF01). syngo Dynamics application server hosts a web service using an operation with improper write access control that could allow to write data in any folder accessible to the account assigned to the websiteâ€™s application pool.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:siemens:syngo_dynamics_cardiovascular_imaging_and_information_system:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:siemens:syngo_dynamics_cardiovascular_imaging_and_information_system:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:siemens:syngo_dynamics_cardiovascular_imaging_and_information_system:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
