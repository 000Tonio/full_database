If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-45386","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-11-18T15:36:00","references":["https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2022-11-15/#SECURITY-766"],"summary":"Jenkins Violations Plugin 0.7.11 and earlier does not configure its XML parser to prevent XML external entity (XXE) attacks.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:violations:-:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:violations:-:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:violations:0.7.11:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:violations:0.7.11:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:violations:-:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:jenkins:violations:0.7.11:*:*:*:*:jenkins:*:*"]}
