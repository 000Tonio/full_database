Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":1.9,"cvss-time":"2022-06-24T02:58:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-20195","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-06-24T02:58:00","references":["https://source.android.com/security/bulletin/pixel/2022-06-01"],"summary":"In the keystore library, there is a possible prevention of access to system Settings due to unsafe deserialization.
