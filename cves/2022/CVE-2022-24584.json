The Yubico OTP supposedly creates hardware bound second factor credentials. When a user reprograms the OTP functionality by \"writing\" it on a token using the Yubico Personalization Tool, they can then upload the new configuration to Yubicos OTP validation servers. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because there is no way for a YubiKey device to prevent a user from deciding that a secret value, which is imported into the device, should also be stored elsewhere.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:yubico:otp:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:yubico:otp:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:yubico:otp:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
