If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-40705","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-09-24T02:36:00","references":["https://lists.apache.org/thread/02yo04w93rdjmllz4454lvodn5xzhwhl","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/09/22/1"],"summary":"** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** An Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference vulnerability in RPCRouterServlet of Apache SOAP allows an attacker to read arbitrary files over HTTP.
