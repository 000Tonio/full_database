Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-3679","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-01-13T06:48:00","references":["https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/ec4b9bf7-71d6-4528-9dd1-cc7779624760"],"summary":"The Starter Templates by Kadence WP WordPress plugin before 1.2.17 unserialises the content of an imported file, which could lead to PHP object injection issues when an admin import (intentionally or not) a malicious file and a suitable gadget chain is present on the blog.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:kadencewp:starter_templates:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:kadencewp:starter_templates:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:kadencewp:starter_templates:*:*:*:*:*:wordpress:*:*"]}
