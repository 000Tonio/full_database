Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2022-05-11T16:19:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-25767","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2022-05-11T16:19:00","references":["https://github.com/JinYiTong/CVE-Req/blob/main/ureport2/ureport2-console.md","https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMBSTEKUREPORT-2322018"],"summary":"All versions of package com.bstek.ureport:ureport2-console are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution by connecting to a malicious database server, causing arbitrary file read and deserialization of local gadgets.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ureport2_project:ureport2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ureport2_project:ureport2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:ureport2_project:ureport2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
