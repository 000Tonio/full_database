If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-34001","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-07-27T17:55:00","references":["https://prisminfosec.com/cve-2022-34001/"],"summary":"Unit4 ERP through 7.9 allows XXE via ExecuteServerProcessAsynchronously.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:unit4:enterprise_resource_planning:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:unit4:enterprise_resource_planning:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:unit4:enterprise_resource_planning:7.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:unit4:enterprise_resource_planning:7.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:unit4:enterprise_resource_planning:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:unit4:enterprise_resource_planning:7.9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
