If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-2131","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-08-01T18:36:00","references":["https://www.incibe-cert.es/en/early-warning/security-advisories/openkm-xxe-injection"],"summary":"OpenKM Community Edition in its 6.3.10 version and before was using XMLReader parser in XMLTextExtractor.java file without the required security flags, allowing an attacker to perform a XML external entity injection attack.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:openkm:openkm:6.3.10:*:*:*:community:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:openkm:openkm:6.3.10:*:*:*:community:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:openkm:openkm:6.3.10:*:*:*:community:*:*:*"]}
