Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-32521","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-02-07T20:06:00","references":["https://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_enDocType=Security+and+Safety+Notice&p_File_Name=SEVD-2022-165-04_+Data_Center_Expert_Security_Notification.pdf&p_Doc_Ref=SEVD-2022-165-04"],"summary":"A CWE 502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability exists that could allow code to be remotely executed on the server when unsafely deserialized data is posted to the web server.
