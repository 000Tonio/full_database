Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-38352","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-09-16T19:31:00","references":["https://github.com/top-think/framework/issues/2749"],"summary":"ThinkPHP v6.0.13 was discovered to contain a deserialization vulnerability via the component League\\Flysystem\\Cached\\Storage\\Psr6Cache.
