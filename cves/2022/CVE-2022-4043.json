Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-4043","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-01-13T06:43:00","references":["https://wpscan.com/vulnerability/ffff8c83-0a59-450a-9b40-c7f3af7205fc"],"summary":"The WP Custom Admin Interface WordPress plugin before 7.29 unserialize user input provided via the settings, which could allow high privilege users such as admin to perform PHP Object Injection when a suitable gadget is present.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:wp_custom_admin_interface_project:wp_custom_admin_interface:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:wp_custom_admin_interface_project:wp_custom_admin_interface:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:wp_custom_admin_interface_project:wp_custom_admin_interface:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
