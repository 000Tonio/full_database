Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2022-41203","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-11-09T15:56:00","references":["https://www.sap.com/documents/2022/02/fa865ea4-167e-0010-bca6-c68f7e60039b.html","https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3243924"],"summary":"In some workflow of SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform (Central Management Console and BI LaunchPad), an authenticated attacker with low privileges can intercept a serialized object in the parameters and substitute with another malicious serialized object, which leads to deserialization of untrusted data vulnerability.
