The TFG dialect of TensorFlow (MLIR) makes several assumptions about the incoming `GraphDef` before converting it to the MLIR-based dialect. If an attacker changes the `SavedModel` format on disk to invalidate these assumptions and the `GraphDef` is then converted to MLIR-based IR then they can cause a crash in the Python interpreter. Under certain scenarios, heap OOB read/writes are possible. These issues have been discovered via fuzzing and it is possible that more weaknesses exist. We will patch them as they are discovered.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:google:tensorflow:2.7.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
