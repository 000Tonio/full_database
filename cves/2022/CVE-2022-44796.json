The authorization service has a flow that allows getting access to the Web UI without knowing credentials. For signing, the JWT token uses a secret key that is generated through a function that doesn't produce cryptographically strong sequences. An attacker can predict these sequences and generate a JWT token. As a result, an attacker can get access to the Web UI. This is fixed in 1.0.13.1611.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:objectfirst:object_first:1.0.7.712:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:objectfirst:object_first:1.0.7.712:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:objectfirst:object_first:1.0.7.712:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
