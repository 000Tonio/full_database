The device runs a CGI binary (index.cgi) to offer a management web application. Once authenticated with valid credentials in this web portal, a potential attacker could submit any \"Address\" value and it would be copied to a second variable with a \"strcpy\" vulnerable function without checking its length. Because of this, it is possible to send a long address value to overflow the process stack, controlling the function return address.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:circutor:compact_dc-s_basic_firmware:1.2.17:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:circutor:compact_dc-s_basic_firmware:1.2.17:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:circutor:compact_dc-s_basic:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:circutor:compact_dc-s_basic:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:circutor:compact_dc-s_basic_firmware:1.2.17:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
