If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-45121","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-03-22T12:48:00","references":["https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-23-080-05"],"summary":"Versions of VISAM VBASE Automation Base prior to 11.7.5 may disclose information if a valid user opens a specially crafted file.","vulnerable_configuration":[],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":[]}
