Starting with version 2.2.0 and prior to version 2.3.1, users who expected their `multiselect` fields to use the field-level access control - if configured - are vulnerable to their field-level access control not being used. List-level access control is not affected. Field-level access control for fields other than `multiselect` are not affected. Version 2.3.1 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, stop using the `multiselect` field.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:keystonejs:keystone:2.2.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:keystonejs:keystone:2.2.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:keystonejs:keystone:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:keystonejs:keystone:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:keystonejs:keystone:2.2.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:keystonejs:keystone:2.3.0:*:*:*:*:node.js:*:*"]}
