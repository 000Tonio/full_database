This vulnerability is due to improper authorization checking for HTTP requests that are submitted to the affected web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected instance of AppDynamics Controller. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the login page for an administrative console. AppDynamics has released software updates that address this vulnerability.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:appdynamics_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:cisco:appdynamics_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:cisco:appdynamics_controller:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
