The resulting output will cause an error when used in other operations. This may be leveraged by an attacker to cause an error scenario in applications which use the library, resulting in a limited denial of service for an individual user. The scope of impact cannot extend to other components.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:westerndigital:sweet_b:1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:westerndigital:sweet_b:1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:westerndigital:sweet_b:1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
