If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2022-43473","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-03-30T17:15:00","references":["https://www.manageengine.com/itom/advisory/cve-2022-43473.html","https://talosintelligence.com/vulnerability_reports/TALOS-2022-1685"],"summary":"A blind XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability exists in the Add UCS Device functionality of ManageEngine OpManager 12.6.168.
