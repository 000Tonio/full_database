The adversary can leverage a race condition by \"running the race\", modifying the resource and modifying the normal execution flow.

A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":1.2,"cvss-time":"2023-02-13T04:34:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:H/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2012-3500","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2023-02-13T04:34:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/55358","http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2012-September/087335.html","http://www.debian.org/security/2012/dsa-2549","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=848022","http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2012-September/086159.html","http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/rpmdevtools.git/commit/?id=90b4400c2ab2e80cecfd8dfdf031536376ed2cdb","http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2012-September/086138.html","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/08/31/7","http://secunia.com/advisories/50600","http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/USN-1593-1","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-updates/2012-11/msg00000.html","http://www.mandriva.com/security/advisories?name=MDVSA-2013:123","https://wiki.mageia.org/en/Support/Advisories/MGASA-2012-0316","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/78230","http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=devscripts/devscripts.git%3Ba=commit%3Bh=4d23a5e6c90f7a37b0972b30f5d31dce97a93eb0"],"refmap":{"bid":["55358"],"confirm":["http://anonscm.debian.org/gitweb/?p=devscripts/devscripts.git;a=commit;h=4d23a5e6c90f7a37b0972b30f5d31dce97a93eb0","http://git.fedorahosted.org/cgit/rpmdevtools.git/commit/?id=90b4400c2ab2e80cecfd8dfdf031536376ed2cdb","https://wiki.mageia.org/en/Support/Advisories/MGASA-2012-0316"],"debian":["DSA-2549"],"fedora":["FEDORA-2012-13208","FEDORA-2012-13234","FEDORA-2012-13263"],"mandriva":["MDVSA-2013:123"],"misc":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=848022"],"mlist":["[oss-security] 20120831 [Notification] CVE-2012-3500 - rpmdevtools, devscripts: TOCTOU race condition in annotate-output"],"secunia":["50600"],"suse":["openSUSE-SU-2012:1437"],"ubuntu":["USN-1593-1"],"xf":["rpmdevtools-toctou-symlink(78230)"]},"summary":"scripts/annotate-output.sh in devscripts before 2.12.2, as used in rpmdevtools before 8.3, allows local users to modify arbitrary files via a symlink attack on the temporary (1) standard output or (2) standard error output file.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:devscripts_devel_team:devscripts:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:devscripts_devel_team:devscripts:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:devscripts_devel_team:devscripts:2.12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:devscripts_devel_team:devscripts:2.12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:fedora:rpmdevtools:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:fedora:rpmdevtools:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:devscripts_devel_team:devscripts:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:devscripts_devel_team:devscripts:2.12.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
