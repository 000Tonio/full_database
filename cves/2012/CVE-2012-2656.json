If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2019-12-23T19:59:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2012-2656","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2019-12-23T19:59:00","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/05/29/11","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/05/29/9","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2012-2656","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-2656","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2656"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/05/29/11","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/05/29/9","https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2012-2656","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2012-2656","https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2656"]},"summary":"An XML eXternal Entity (XXE) issue exists in Restlet 1.1.10 in an endpoint using XML transport, which lets a remote attacker obtain sensitive information.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:talend:restlet:1.1.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:talend:restlet:1.1.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:talend:restlet:1.1.10:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
