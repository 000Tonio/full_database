Most applications assume that users will provide static text and may respond unpredictably to the presence of formatting character. For example, in certain functions of the C programming languages such as printf, the formatting character %s will print the contents of a memory location expecting this location to identify a string and the formatting character %n prints the number of DWORD written in the memory. An adversary can use this to read or write to memory locations or files, or simply to manipulate the value of the resulting text in unexpected ways. Reading or writing memory may result in program crashes and writing memory could result in the execution of arbitrary code if the adversary can write to the program stack."}],"cvss":5,"cvss-time":"2017-08-29T01:31:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-134","id":"CVE-2012-1152","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2017-08-29T01:31:00","references":["http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=661548","http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2012-April/077004.html","http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2012-April/077023.html","http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/package-announce/2012-April/077782.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-updates/2012-08/msg00029.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-updates/2015-02/msg00078.html","http://secunia.com/advisories/48317","http://secunia.com/advisories/50277","http://www.debian.org/security/2012/dsa-2432","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/03/09/6","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2012/03/10/4","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/52381","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=801738","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/73856","https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=46507","https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=75365"],"refmap":{"bid":["52381"],"debian":["DSA-2432"],"fedora":["FEDORA-2012-4871","FEDORA-2012-4997","FEDORA-2012-5035"],"misc":["http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=661548","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=801738","https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=46507","https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=75365"],"mlist":["[oss-security] 20120309 CVE Request -- libdbd-pg-perl / perl-DBD-Pg && libyaml-libyaml-perl / perl-YAML-LibYAML: Multiple format string flaws","[oss-security] 20120309 Re: CVE Request -- libdbd-pg-perl / perl-DBD-Pg && libyaml-libyaml-perl / perl-YAML-LibYAML: Multiple format string flaws"],"secunia":["48317","50277"],"suse":["openSUSE-SU-2012:1000","openSUSE-SU-2015:0319"],"xf":["yaml-load-format-string(73856)"]},"summary":"Multiple format string vulnerabilities in the error reporting functionality in the YAML::LibYAML (aka YAML-LibYAML and perl-YAML-LibYAML) module 0.38 for Perl allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process crash) via format string specifiers in a (1) YAML stream to the Load function, (2) YAML node to the load_node function, (3) YAML mapping to the load_mapping function, or (4) YAML sequence to the load_sequence function.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ingy:yaml\\:\\:libyaml:0.38:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ingy:yaml\\:\\:libyaml:0.38:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:ingy:yaml\\:\\:libyaml:0.38:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
