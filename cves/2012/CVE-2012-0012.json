A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":4.3,"cvss-time":"2022-03-01T16:29:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-665","id":"CVE-2012-0012","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2022-03-01T16:29:00","msbulletin":[{"bulletin_id":"MS12-010","bulletin_url":null,"date":"2012-02-14T00:00:00","impact":"Remote Code Execution","knowledgebase_id":"2647516","knowledgebase_url":null,"severity":"Critical","title":"Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer"}],"oval":[{"accepted":"2014-08-18T04:01:09.413-04:00","class":"vulnerability","contributors":[{"name":"Josh Turpin","organization":"Symantec Corporation"},{"name":"Maria Mikhno","organization":"ALTX-SOFT"}],"definition_extensions":[{"comment":"Microsoft Windows Vista (32-bit) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:1282"},{"comment":"Microsoft Windows Vista x64 Edition is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:2041"},{"comment":"Microsoft Windows 7 (32-bit) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:6165"},{"comment":"Microsoft Windows 7 x64 Edition is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:5950"},{"comment":"Microsoft Windows Server 2008 (32-bit) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:4870"},{"comment":"Microsoft Windows Server 2008 (64-bit) is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:5356"},{"comment":"Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 x64 Edition is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:6438"},{"comment":"Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 Itanium-Based Edition is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:5954"},{"comment":"Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:11985"}],"description":"Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 does not properly handle the creation and initialization of string objects, which allows remote attackers to read data from arbitrary process-memory locations via a crafted web site, aka \"Null Byte Information Disclosure Vulnerability.\"","family":"windows","id":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:14870","status":"accepted","submitted":"2012-02-14T13:00:00","title":"Null Byte Information Disclosure Vulnerability","version":"78"}],"references":["http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/techalerts/TA12-045A.html","https://oval.cisecurity.org/repository/search/definition/oval%3Aorg.mitre.oval%3Adef%3A14870","https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2012/ms12-010"],"refmap":{"cert":["TA12-045A"]},"summary":"Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 does not properly handle the creation and initialization of string objects, which allows remote attackers to read data from arbitrary process-memory locations via a crafted web site, aka \"Null Byte Information Disclosure Vulnerability.\"","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_7:-:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_7:-:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2008:-:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2008:-:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2008:r2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2008:r2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2008:r2:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_server_2008:r2:sp1:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_vista:-:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:microsoft:windows_vista:-:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:internet_explorer:9:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
