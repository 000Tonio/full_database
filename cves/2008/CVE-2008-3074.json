Doing so ensures that the available protection mechanisms in the language are intact and applicable.

Also, processes must shed privileges as soon as they no longer require them.","summary":"In this type of an attack, an adversary injects operating system commands into existing application functions.

Build a function that takes user input and converts it to applications specific types and values, stripping or filtering out all unauthorized commands and characters in the process. Design: Limit program privileges, so if metacharacters or other methods circumvent program input validation routines and shell access is attained then it is not running under a privileged account. chroot jails create a sandbox for the application to execute in, making it more difficult for an attacker to elevate privilege even in the case that a compromise has occurred. Implementation: Implement an audit log that is written to a separate host, in the event of a compromise the audit log may be able to provide evidence and details of the compromise.","summary":"An attacker changes the behavior or state of a targeted application through injecting data or command syntax through the targets use of non-validated and non-filtered arguments of exposed services or methods."},{"id":"15","name":"Command Delimiters","prerequisites":"Software's input validation or filtering must not detect and block presence of additional malicious command.","related_weakness":["138","140","146","154","157","184","185","697","713","77","78","93"],"solutions":"Design: Perform whitelist validation against a positive specification for command length, type, and parameters.

The system that uses a filter or a blacklist input validation, as opposed to whitelist validation is vulnerable to an attacker who predicts delimiters (or combinations of delimiters) not present in the filter or blacklist. As with other injection attacks, the attacker uses the command delimiter payload as an entry point to tunnel through the application and activate additional attacks through SQL queries, shell commands, network scanning, and so on."},{"id":"108","name":"Command Line Execution through SQL Injection","prerequisites":"The application does not properly validate data before storing in the database Backend application implicitly trusts the data stored in the database Malicious data is used on the backend as a command line argument","related_weakness":["114","20","74","78","89"],"solutions":"Disable MSSQL xp_cmdshell directive on the database Properly validate the data (syntactically and semantically) before writing it to the database.

This could be done directly through misuse of directives such as MSSQL_xp_cmdshell or indirectly through injection of data into the database that would be interpreted as shell commands. Sometime later, an unscrupulous backend application (or could be part of the functionality of the same application) fetches the injected data stored in the database and uses this data as command line arguments without performing proper validation.

It may be necessary to implement redundant checking across different input validation layers. Ensure that invalid data is rejected as soon as possible and do not continue to work with it. Make sure to perform input validation on canonicalized data (i.e. data that is data in its most standard form). This will help avoid tricky encodings getting past the filters. Assume all input is malicious. Create a white list that defines all valid input to the software system based on the requirements specifications. Input that does not match against the white list should not be permitted to enter into the system.","summary":"An attacker supplies the target software with input data that contains sequences of special characters designed to bypass input validation logic. This exploit relies on the target making multiples passes over the input data and processing a \"layer\" of special characters with each pass. In this manner, the attacker can disguise input that would otherwise be rejected as invalid by concealing it with layers of special/escape characters that are stripped off by subsequent processing steps. The goal is to first discover cases where the input validation layer executes before one or more parsing layers. That is, user input may go through the following logic in an application: <parser1> --> <input validator> --> <parser2>. In such cases, the attacker will need to provide input that will pass through the input validator, but after passing through parser2, will be converted into something that the input validator was supposed to stop."}],"cvss":9.3,"cvss-time":"2017-09-29T01:31:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-78","id":"CVE-2008-3074","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2017-09-29T01:31:00","oval":[{"accepted":"2013-04-29T04:08:24.295-04:00","class":"vulnerability","contributors":[{"name":"Aharon Chernin","organization":"SCAP.com, LLC"},{"name":"Dragos Prisaca","organization":"G2, Inc."}],"definition_extensions":[{"comment":"The operating system installed on the system is Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:11414"},{"comment":"The operating system installed on the system is CentOS Linux 5.x","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:15802"},{"comment":"Oracle Linux 5.x","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:15459"}],"description":"\t\tin this CVE description and in external mappings to this identifier.","family":"unix","id":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:10754","status":"accepted","submitted":"2010-07-09T03:56:16-04:00","title":"\t\tin this CVE description and in external mappings to this identifier.","version":"18"}],"redhat":{"advisories":[{"rhsa":{"id":"RHSA-2008:0580"}}],"rpms":["vim-X11-2:7.0.109-4.el5_2.4z","vim-common-2:7.0.109-4.el5_2.4z","vim-debuginfo-2:7.0.109-4.el5_2.4z","vim-enhanced-2:7.0.109-4.el5_2.4z","vim-minimal-2:7.0.109-4.el5_2.4z"]},"references":["http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=506919","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2009-03/msg00004.html","http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=121494431426308&w=2","http://secunia.com/advisories/34418","http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Advisories:rPSA-2008-0324","http://www.mandriva.com/security/advisories?name=MDVSA-2008:236","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/07/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/07/4","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/08/12","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/10/7","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/13/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/07/15/4","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/08/01/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/10/15/1","http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/10/20/2","http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim.html","http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-shellescape.html","http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2008-0580.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/32462","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=467428","https://oval.cisecurity.org/repository/search/definition/oval%3Aorg.mitre.oval%3Adef%3A10754"],"refmap":{"bid":["32462"],"bugtraq":["20080701 Re: Collection of Vulnerabilities in Fully Patched Vim 7.1"],"confirm":["http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=506919","http://wiki.rpath.com/wiki/Advisories:rPSA-2008-0324","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=467428"],"mandriva":["MDVSA-2008:236"],"misc":["http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim-shellescape.html","http://www.rdancer.org/vulnerablevim.html"],"mlist":["[oss-security] 20080707 Re: More arbitrary code executions in Netrw version 125, Vim 7.2a.10","[oss-security] 20080708 Re: More arbitrary code executions in Netrw version 125, Vim 7.2a.10","[oss-security] 20080710 Re: Re: More arbitrary code executions in Netrw version 125, Vim 7.2a.10","[oss-security] 20080713 Re: Re: More arbitrary code executions in Netrw version 125, Vim 7.2a.10","[oss-security] 20080715 Re: Re: More arbitrary code executions in Netrw","[oss-security] 20080731 Re: Re: More arbitrary code executions in Netrw version 125, Vim 7.2a.10","[oss-security] 20081015 Vim CVE issues cleanup (plugins tar.vim, zip.vim) - CVE-2008-3074 and CVE-2008-3075","[oss-security] 20081020 CVE request (vim)"],"secunia":["34418"],"suse":["SUSE-SR:2009:007"]},"summary":"The shellescape function in Vim 7.0 through 7.2, including 7.2a.10, allows user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via the \"!\" (exclamation point) shell metacharacter in (1) the filename of a tar archive and possibly (2) the filename of the first file in a tar archive, which is not properly handled by the VIM TAR plugin (tar.vim) v.10 through v.22, as demonstrated by the shellescape, tarplugin.v2, tarplugin, and tarplugin.updated test cases.
