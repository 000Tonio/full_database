Implementation: Perform testing such as pen-testing and vulnerability scanning to identify directories, programs, and interfaces that grant direct access to executables. Implementation: Implement host integrity monitoring to detect any unwanted altering of configuration files. Implementation: Ensure that files that are not required to execute, such as configuration files, are not over-privileged, i.e. not allowed to execute.","summary":"An attack of this type exploits a system's trust in configuration and resource files. When the executable loads the resource (such as an image file or configuration file) the attacker has modified the file to either execute malicious code directly or manipulate the target process (e.g. application server) to execute based on the malicious configuration parameters. Since systems are increasingly interrelated mashing up resources from local and remote sources the possibility of this attack occurring is high."},{"id":"77","name":"Manipulating User-Controlled Variables","prerequisites":"A variable consumed by the application server is exposed to the client. A variable consumed by the application server can be overwritten by the user. The application server trusts user supplied data to compute business logic.

This means that a malicious user may be able to set variables unexpectedly. For instance make sure that the server setting for PHP does not expose global variables. A software system should be reluctant to trust variables that have been initialized outside of its trust boundary. Ensure adequate checking is performed when relying on input from outside a trust boundary. Separate the presentation layer and the business logic layer. Variables at the business logic layer should not be exposed at the presentation layer. This is to prevent computation of business logic from user controlled input data. Use encapsulation when declaring your variables. This is to lower the exposure of your variables. Assume all input is malicious. Create a white list that defines all valid input to the software system based on the requirements specifications. Input that does not match against the white list should be rejected by the program.","summary":"This attack targets user controlled variables (DEBUG=1, PHP Globals, and So Forth). An attacker can override environment variables leveraging user-supplied, untrusted query variables directly used on the application server without any data sanitization. In extreme cases, the attacker can change variables controlling the business logic of the application. For instance, in languages like PHP, a number of poorly set default configurations may allow the user to override variables."}],"cvss":9.3,"cvss-time":"2018-10-12T21:45:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-94","id":"CVE-2008-0118","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2018-10-12T21:45:00","oval":[{"accepted":"2012-05-28T04:01:49.684-04:00","class":"vulnerability","contributors":[{"name":"Sudhir Gandhe","organization":"Secure Elements, Inc."},{"name":"Sudhir Gandhe","organization":"Secure Elements, Inc."},{"name":"Pradeep R B","organization":"SecPod Technologies"},{"name":"Shane Shaffer","organization":"G2, Inc."}],"definition_extensions":[{"comment":"Microsoft Office 2000 is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:93"},{"comment":"Microsoft Office XP is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:663"},{"comment":"Microsoft Office 2003 is installed","oval":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:233"}],"description":"Unspecified vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2000 SP3, XP SP3, 2003 SP2, Excel Viewer 2003 up to SP3, and Office 2004 for Mac allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted Office document that triggers memory corruption from an \"allocation error,\" aka \"Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability.\"","family":"windows","id":"oval:org.mitre.oval:def:5190","status":"accepted","submitted":"2008-03-11T14:47:00","title":"Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability","version":"9"}],"references":["http://marc.info/?l=bugtraq&m=120585858807305&w=2","http://secunia.com/advisories/29321","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/28146","http://www.securitytracker.com/id?1019578","http://www.us-cert.gov/cas/techalerts/TA08-071A.html","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2008/0848/references","https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2008/ms08-016","https://oval.cisecurity.org/repository/search/definition/oval%3Aorg.mitre.oval%3Adef%3A5190"],"refmap":{"bid":["28146"],"cert":["TA08-071A"],"hp":["HPSBST02320","SSRT080028"],"sectrack":["1019578"],"secunia":["29321"],"vupen":["ADV-2008-0848"]},"saint":[{"bid":"28146","description":"Microsoft Office Drawing Shapes memory corruption vulnerability","id":"win_patch_office2000,win_patch_office2002,win_patch_office2004macver","osvdb":"42709","title":"ms_office_drawing_shapes","type":"client"}],"summary":"Unspecified vulnerability in Microsoft Office 2000 SP3, XP SP3, 2003 SP2, Excel Viewer 2003 up to SP3, and Office 2004 for Mac allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted Office document that triggers memory corruption from an \"allocation error,\" aka \"Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability.\"","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:office:2000:sp3:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:office:2000:sp3:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:office:2003:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:office:2003:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:office:2004:*:mac:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:office:2004:*:mac:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:office:xp:sp3:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:office:xp:sp3:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:office:2000:sp3:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:office:2003:sp2:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:office:2004:*:mac:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:microsoft:office:xp:sp3:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
