The adversary can leverage a race condition by \"running the race\", modifying the resource and modifying the normal execution flow. For instance, a race condition can occur while accessing a file: the adversary can trick the system by replacing the original file with his version and cause the system to read the malicious file."},{"id":"29","name":"Leveraging Time-of-Check and Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Conditions","prerequisites":"A resource is access/modified concurrently by multiple processes.

A typical example is file access. The adversary can leverage a file access race condition by \"running the race\", meaning that they would modify the resource between the first time the target program accesses the file and the time the target program uses the file. During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly."}],"cvss":6.9,"cvss-time":"2017-08-08T01:30:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-362","id":"CVE-2008-1570","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2017-08-08T01:30:00","references":["http://secunia.com/advisories/29738","http://security.gentoo.org/glsa/glsa-200804-11.xml","http://www.osvdb.org/43888","https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214403","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/41570"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=214403"],"gentoo":["GLSA-200804-11"],"osvdb":["43888"],"secunia":["29738"],"xf":["policydweight-createlockpath-race-condition(41570)"]},"summary":"Race condition in the create_lockpath function in policyd-weight 0.1.14 beta-16 allows local users to modify or delete arbitrary files by creating the LOCKPATH directory, then modifying it after the symbolic link check occurs.
