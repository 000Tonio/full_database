An attacker who has access to an API may try to embed malicious code in the API function call and exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in the function's implementation. All clients that make use of the code library thus become vulnerable by association. This has a very broad effect on security across a system, usually affecting more than one software process."},{"id":"10","name":"Buffer Overflow via Environment Variables","prerequisites":"The application uses environment variables. An environment variable exposed to the user is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. The vulnerable environment variable uses untrusted data. Tainted data used in the environment variables is not properly validated. For instance boundary checking is not done before copying the input data to a buffer.","related_weakness":["118","119","120","20","302","680","697","733","74","99"],"solutions":"Do not expose environment variable to the user.

Once the attacker finds that they can modify an environment variable, they may try to overflow associated buffers. This attack leverages implicit trust often placed in environment variables."},{"id":"123","name":"Buffer Manipulation","prerequisites":"The adversary must identify a programmatic means for interacting with a buffer, such as vulnerable C code, and be able to provide input to this interaction.","related_weakness":["119"],"solutions":"To help protect an application from buffer manipulation attacks, a number of potential mitigations can be leveraged. Before starting the development of the application, consider using a code language (e.g., Java) or compiler that limits the ability of developers to act beyond the bounds of a buffer. If the chosen language is susceptible to buffer related issues (e.g., C) then consider using secure functions instead of those vulnerable to buffer manipulations. If a potentially dangerous function must be used, make sure that proper boundary checking is performed. Additionally, there are often a number of compiler-based mechanisms (e.g., StackGuard, ProPolice and the Microsoft Visual Studio /GS flag) that can help identify and protect against potential buffer issues. Finally, there may be operating system level preventative functionality that can be applied.","summary":"An adversary manipulates an application's interaction with a buffer in an attempt to read or modify data they shouldn't have access to. Buffer attacks are distinguished in that it is the buffer space itself that is the target of the attack rather than any code responsible for interpreting the content of the buffer. In virtually all buffer attacks the content that is placed in the buffer is immaterial. Instead, most buffer attacks involve retrieving or providing more input than can be stored in the allocated buffer, resulting in the reading or overwriting of other unintended program memory."},{"id":"24","name":"Filter Failure through Buffer Overflow","prerequisites":"Ability to control the length of data passed to an active filter.","related_weakness":["118","119","120","20","680","697","733","74"],"solutions":"Make sure that ANY failure occurring in the filtering or input validation routine is properly handled and that offending input is NOT allowed to go through.

Design: Use an abstraction library to abstract away risky APIs. Not a complete solution.","summary":"In this attack, the idea is to cause an active filter to fail by causing an oversized transaction. An attacker may try to feed overly long input strings to the program in an attempt to overwhelm the filter (by causing a buffer overflow) and hoping that the filter does not fail securely (i.e. the user input is let into the system unfiltered)."},{"id":"47","name":"Buffer Overflow via Parameter Expansion","prerequisites":"The program expands one of the parameters passed to a function with input controlled by the user, but a later function making use of the expanded parameter erroneously considers the original, not the expanded size of the parameter. The expanded parameter is used in the context where buffer overflow may become possible due to the incorrect understanding of the parameter size (i.e. thinking that it is smaller than it really is).","related_weakness":["118","119","120","130","131","20","680","697","74"],"solutions":"Ensure that when parameter expansion happens in the code that the assumptions used to determine the resulting size of the parameter are accurate and that the new size of the parameter is visible to the whole system","summary":"In this attack, the target software is given input that the attacker knows will be modified and expanded in size during processing.

Binary resources may include music files like MP3, image files like JPEG files, and any other binary file. These attacks may pass unnoticed to the client machine through normal usage of files, such as a browser loading a seemingly innocent JPEG file. This can allow the attacker access to the execution stack and execute arbitrary code in the target process. This attack pattern is a variant of standard buffer overflow attacks using an unexpected vector (binary files) to wrap its attack and open up a new attack vector. The attacker is required to either directly serve the binary content to the victim, or place it in a locale like a MP3 sharing application, for the victim to download. The attacker then is notified upon the download or otherwise locates the vulnerability opened up by the buffer overflow."},{"id":"42","name":"MIME Conversion","prerequisites":"The target system uses a mail server.
