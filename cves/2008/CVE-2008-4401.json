Web servers, ftp servers, and message oriented middleware systems which have many integration points are particularly vulnerable, because both the programmers and the administrators must be in synch regarding the interfaces and the correct privileges for each interface."},{"id":"69","name":"Target Programs with Elevated Privileges","prerequisites":"The targeted program runs with elevated OS privileges. The targeted program accepts input data from the user or from another program. The targeted program does not perform input validation properly. The targeted program does not fail safely. For instance when a program fails it may authorize restricted access to anyone. The targeted program has a vulnerability such as buffer overflow which may be exploited if a malicious user can inject unvalidated data. For instance a buffer overflow interrupts the program as it executes, and makes it run additional code supplied by the attacker. If the program under attack has elevated privileges to the OS, the attacker can elevate its privileges (such as having root level access). The targeted program is giving away information about itself. Before performing such attack, an eventual attacker may need to gather information about the services running on the host target. The more the host target is verbose about the services that are running (version number of application, etc.) the more information can be gather by an attacker. This attack often requires communicating with the host target services directly. For instance Telnet may be enough to communicate with the host target.","related_weakness":["15","250","264"],"solutions":"Apply the principle of least privilege. Validate all untrusted data. Apply the latest patches. Scan your services and disable the ones which are not needed and are exposed unnecessarily. Exposing programs increases the attack surface. Only expose the services which are needed and have security mechanisms such as authentication built around them. Avoid revealing information about your system (e.g., version of the program) to anonymous users. Make sure that your program or service fail safely. What happen if the communication protocol is interrupted suddenly? What happen if a parameter is missing? Does your system have resistance and resilience to attack? Fail safely when a resource exhaustion occurs. If possible use a sandbox model which limits the actions that programs can take. A sandbox restricts a program to a set of privileges and commands that make it difficult or impossible for the program to cause any damage. Check your program for buffer overflow and format String vulnerabilities which can lead to execution of malicious code. Monitor traffic and resource usage and pay attention if resource exhaustion occurs. Protect your log file from unauthorized modification and log forging.","summary":"This attack targets programs running with elevated privileges. The attacker would try to leverage a bug in the running program and get arbitrary code to execute with elevated privileges. For instance an attacker would look for programs that write to the system directories or registry keys (such as HKLM, which stores a number of critical Windows environment variables). These programs are typically running with elevated privileges and have usually not been designed with security in mind. Such programs are excellent exploit targets because they yield lots of power when they break. The malicious user try to execute its code at the same level as a privileged system call."},{"id":"58","name":"Restful Privilege Elevation","prerequisites":"The attacker needs to be able to identify HTTP Get URLs. The Get methods must be set to call applications that perform operations other than get such as update and delete.","related_weakness":["264","267","269"],"solutions":"Design: Enforce principle of least privilege Implementation: Ensure that HTTP Get methods only retrieve state and do not alter state on the server side Implementation: Ensure that HTTP methods have proper ACLs based on what the functionality they expose","summary":"Rest uses standard HTTP (Get, Put, Delete) style permissions methods, but these are not necessarily correlated generally with back end programs. Strict interpretation of HTTP get methods means that these HTTP Get services should not be used to delete information on the server, but there is no access control mechanism to back up this logic. This means that unless the services are properly ACL'd and the application's service implementation are following these guidelines then an HTTP request can easily execute a delete or update on the server side. The attacker identifies a HTTP Get URL such as http://victimsite/updateOrder, which calls out to a program to update orders on a database or other resource. The URL is not idempotent so the request can be submitted multiple times by the attacker, additionally, the attacker may be able to exploit the URL published as a Get method that actually performs updates (instead of merely retrieving data). This may result in malicious or inadvertent altering of data on the server."}],"cvss":10,"cvss-time":"2018-10-30T16:26:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-264","id":"CVE-2008-4401","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2018-10-30T16:26:00","redhat":{"advisories":[{"rhsa":{"id":"RHSA-2008:0945"}},{"rhsa":{"id":"RHSA-2008:0980"}}],"rpms":["flash-plugin-0:10.0.12.36-2.el5","flash-plugin-0:9.0.151.0-1.el3.with.oss","flash-plugin-0:9.0.151.0-1.el4"]},"references":["http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2008-11/msg00001.html","http://secunia.com/advisories/32270","http://secunia.com/advisories/32448","http://secunia.com/advisories/32702","http://secunia.com/advisories/32759","http://secunia.com/advisories/33390","http://secunia.com/advisories/34226","http://security.gentoo.org/glsa/glsa-200903-23.xml","http://securitytracker.com/id?1021061","http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-248586-1","http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/ASA-2008-440.htm","http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/ASA-2009-020.htm","http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/fplayer10_security_changes.html","http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb08-18.html","http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2008-0945.html","http://www.redhat.com/support/errata/RHSA-2008-0980.html","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2008/2838","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/45913"],"refmap":{"confirm":["http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/ASA-2008-440.htm","http://support.avaya.com/elmodocs2/security/ASA-2009-020.htm","http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flashplayer/articles/fplayer10_security_changes.html","http://www.adobe.com/support/security/bulletins/apsb08-18.html"],"gentoo":["GLSA-200903-23"],"sectrack":["1021061"],"secunia":["32270","32448","32702","32759","33390","34226"],"sunalert":["248586"],"suse":["SUSE-SR:2008:025"],"vupen":["ADV-2008-2838"],"xf":["adobe-flash-filereference-file-upload(45913)"]},"summary":"ActionScript
