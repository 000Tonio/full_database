An attacker can take advantage of the multiple ways of encoding a URL and abuse the interpretation of the URL. A URL may contain special character that need special syntax handling in order to be interpreted. Special characters are represented using a percentage character followed by two digits representing the octet code of the original character (%HEX-CODE). For instance US-ASCII space character would be represented with %20. This is often referred as escaped ending or percent-encoding. Since the server decodes the URL from the requests, it may restrict the access to some URL paths by validating and filtering out the URL requests it received. An attacker will try to craft an URL with a sequence of special characters which once interpreted by the server will be equivalent to a forbidden URL. It can be difficult to protect against this attack since the URL can contain other format of encoding such as UTF-8 encoding, Unicode-encoding, etc."},{"id":"78","name":"Using Escaped Slashes in Alternate Encoding","prerequisites":"The application accepts the backlash character as escape character.

Ensure that all directories, temporary directories and files, and memory are executing with limited privileges to protect against remote execution. Design: Input validation. Assume that user inputs are malicious. Utilize strict type, character, and encoding enforcement.

Design: Run server interfaces with a non-root account and/or utilize chroot jails or other configuration techniques to constrain privileges even if attacker gains some limited access to commands. Implementation: Host integrity monitoring for critical files, directories, and processes. The goal of host integrity monitoring is to be aware when a security issue has occurred so that incident response and other forensic activities can begin. Implementation: Perform input validation for all remote content, including remote and user-generated content. Implementation: Perform testing such as pen-testing and vulnerability scanning to identify directories, programs, and interfaces that grant direct access to executables. Implementation: Use indirect references rather than actual file names. Implementation: Use possible permissions on file access when developing and deploying web applications. Implementation: Validate user input by only accepting known good.

A typical variety of this attack involves specifying a path to a desired file together with dot-dot-slash characters, resulting in the file access API or function traversing out of the intended directory structure and into the root file system. By replacing or modifying the expected path information the access function or API retrieves the file desired by the attacker. These attacks either involve the attacker providing a complete path to a targeted file or using control characters (e.g. path separators (/ or \\) and/or dots (.)) to reach desired directories or files."},{"id":"79","name":"Using Slashes in Alternate Encoding","prerequisites":"The application server accepts paths to locate resources.

An attacker would try to exploit common filtering problems related to the use of the slashes characters to gain access to resources on the target host. Directory-driven systems, such as file systems and databases, typically use the slash character to indicate traversal between directories or other container components. For murky historical reasons, PCs (and, as a result, Microsoft OSs) choose to use a backslash, whereas the UNIX world typically makes use of the forward slash. The schizophrenic result is that many MS-based systems are required to understand both forms of the slash. This gives the attacker many opportunities to discover and abuse a number of common filtering problems. The goal of this pattern is to discover server software that only applies filters to one version, but not the other."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2018-10-11T20:57:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-22","id":"CVE-2008-6508","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-10-11T20:57:00","references":["http://osvdb.org/49663","http://secunia.com/advisories/32478","http://www.andreas-kurtz.de/advisories/AKADV2008-001-v1.0.txt","http://www.andreas-kurtz.de/archives/63","http://www.igniterealtime.org/builds/openfire/docs/latest/changelog.html","http://www.igniterealtime.org/issues/browse/JM-1489","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/498162/100/0/threaded","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/32189","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2008/3061","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/46488","https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/7075"],"refmap":{"bid":["32189"],"bugtraq":["20081108 [AK-ADV2008-001] Openfire Jabber-Server: Multiple Vulnerabilities (Authentication Bypass, SQL injection, ...)"],"confirm":["http://www.igniterealtime.org/builds/openfire/docs/latest/changelog.html","http://www.igniterealtime.org/issues/browse/JM-1489"],"exploit-db":["7075"],"misc":["http://www.andreas-kurtz.de/advisories/AKADV2008-001-v1.0.txt","http://www.andreas-kurtz.de/archives/63"],"osvdb":["49663"],"secunia":["32478"],"vupen":["ADV-2008-3061"],"xf":["openfire-authcheckfilter-security-bypass(46488)"]},"summary":"Directory traversal vulnerability in the AuthCheck filter in the Admin Console in Openfire 3.6.0a and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and access the admin interface via a ..
