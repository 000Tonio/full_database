Most applications assume that users will provide static text and may respond unpredictably to the presence of formatting character. For example, in certain functions of the C programming languages such as printf, the formatting character %s will print the contents of a memory location expecting this location to identify a string and the formatting character %n prints the number of DWORD written in the memory. An adversary can use this to read or write to memory locations or files, or simply to manipulate the value of the resulting text in unexpected ways. Reading or writing memory may result in program crashes and writing memory could result in the execution of arbitrary code if the adversary can write to the program stack."}],"cvss":9.3,"cvss-time":"2018-10-11T20:57:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-134","id":"CVE-2008-6441","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2018-10-11T20:57:00","references":["http://aluigi.altervista.org/adv/unrealcfs-adv.txt","http://archives.neohapsis.com/archives/fulldisclosure/2008-09/0190.html","http://secunia.com/advisories/31854","http://www.osvdb.org/48290","http://www.osvdb.org/48291","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/496297/100/0/threaded","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/31141","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/45088","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/45089","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/45090"],"refmap":{"bid":["31141"],"bugtraq":["20080911 Clients format strings in the Unreal engine"],"fulldisc":["20080911 Clients format strings in the Unreal engine"],"misc":["http://aluigi.altervista.org/adv/unrealcfs-adv.txt"],"osvdb":["48290","48291"],"secunia":["31854"],"xf":["unrealengine-dlmgr-format-string(45088)","unrealengine-pkg-format-string(45089)","unrealengine-welcome-format-string(45090)"]},"summary":"Format string vulnerability in the Epic Games Unreal engine client, as used in multiple games, allows remote servers to execute arbitrary code via (1) the CLASS parameter in a DLMGR command, (2) a malformed package (PKG), and possibly (3) the LEVEL parameter in a WELCOME command.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:epicgames:unreal_engine:2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:epicgames:unreal_engine:2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:epicgames:unreal_engine:2.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:epicgames:unreal_engine:2.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:epicgames:unreal_engine:3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:epicgames:unreal_engine:3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:epicgames:unreal_engine:2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:epicgames:unreal_engine:2.5:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:epicgames:unreal_engine:3:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
