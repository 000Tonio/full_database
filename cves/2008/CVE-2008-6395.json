Most applications assume that users will provide static text and may respond unpredictably to the presence of formatting character. For example, in certain functions of the C programming languages such as printf, the formatting character %s will print the contents of a memory location expecting this location to identify a string and the formatting character %n prints the number of DWORD written in the memory. An adversary can use this to read or write to memory locations or files, or simply to manipulate the value of the resulting text in unexpected ways. Reading or writing memory may result in program crashes and writing memory could result in the execution of arbitrary code if the adversary can write to the program stack."}],"cvss":7.8,"cvss-time":"2017-08-17T01:29:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:C","cwe":"CWE-134","id":"CVE-2008-6395","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2017-08-17T01:29:00","references":["http://lists.grok.org.uk/pipermail/full-disclosure/2008-September/064226.html","http://secunia.com/advisories/31714","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/30988","http://www.securitytracker.com/id?1020807","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/44890"],"refmap":{"bid":["30988"],"fulldisc":["20080902 DDIVRT-2008-14 3Com Wireless 8760 Dual Radio 11a/b/g PoE Access Point Malformed HTTP POST DoS"],"sectrack":["1020807"],"secunia":["31714"],"xf":["3com-access-point-dos(44890)"]},"summary":"The web management interface in 3Com Wireless 8760 Dual Radio 11a/b/g PoE Access Point allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device crash) via a malformed HTTP POST request.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:3com:wireless_8760_dual-radio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:3com:wireless_8760_dual-radio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:h:3com:wireless_8760_dual-radio:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
