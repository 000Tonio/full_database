Most applications assume that users will provide static text and may respond unpredictably to the presence of formatting character. For example, in certain functions of the C programming languages such as printf, the formatting character %s will print the contents of a memory location expecting this location to identify a string and the formatting character %n prints the number of DWORD written in the memory. An adversary can use this to read or write to memory locations or files, or simply to manipulate the value of the resulting text in unexpected ways. Reading or writing memory may result in program crashes and writing memory could result in the execution of arbitrary code if the adversary can write to the program stack."}],"cvss":3.5,"cvss-time":"2018-10-15T22:03:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:N/I:N/A:P","cwe":"CWE-134","id":"CVE-2008-0945","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"NONE","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2018-10-15T22:03:00","references":["http://aluigi.altervista.org/adv/ipsimene-adv.txt","http://aluigi.org/poc/ipsimene.zip","http://secunia.com/advisories/28824","http://securityreason.com/securityalert/3697","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/487748/100/200/threaded","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/27677"],"refmap":{"bid":["27677"],"bugtraq":["20080207 Multiple vulnerabilities in Ipswitch Instant Messaging 2.0.8.1"],"misc":["http://aluigi.altervista.org/adv/ipsimene-adv.txt","http://aluigi.org/poc/ipsimene.zip"],"secunia":["28824"],"sreason":["3697"]},"summary":"Format string vulnerability in the logging function in the IM Server (aka IMserve or IMserver) in Ipswitch Instant Messaging (IM) 2.0.8.1 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly have unspecified other impact via format string specifiers in an IP address field.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ipswitch:imserver:2.0.5.30:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ipswitch:imserver:2.0.5.30:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ipswitch:imserver:2.0.8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ipswitch:imserver:2.0.8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ipswitch:instant_messaging:2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ipswitch:instant_messaging:2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ipswitch:instant_messaging:2.0.8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ipswitch:instant_messaging:2.0.8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:ipswitch:imserver:2.0.5.30:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipswitch:imserver:2.0.8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipswitch:instant_messaging:2.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ipswitch:instant_messaging:2.0.8.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
