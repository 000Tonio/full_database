The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":7.2,"cvss-time":"2020-09-28T15:14:00","cvss-vector":"AV:L/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2008-3357","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2020-09-28T15:14:00","references":["http://labs.idefense.com/intelligence/vulnerabilities/display.php?id=733","http://secunia.com/advisories/31357","http://secunia.com/advisories/31398","http://securitytracker.com/id?1020614","http://www.ingres.com/support/security-alert-080108.php","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/495177/100/0/threaded","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/30512","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2008/2292","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2008/2313","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/44181","https://support.ca.com/irj/portal/anonymous/phpsupcontent?contentID=181989"],"refmap":{"bid":["30512"],"bugtraq":["20080806 CA Products That Embed Ingres Multiple Vulnerabilities"],"confirm":["http://www.ingres.com/support/security-alert-080108.php","https://support.ca.com/irj/portal/anonymous/phpsupcontent?contentID=181989"],"idefense":["20080801 Ingres Database for Linux ingvalidpw Untrusted Library Path Vulnerability"],"sectrack":["1020614"],"secunia":["31357","31398"],"vupen":["ADV-2008-2292","ADV-2008-2313"],"xf":["ingres-ingvalidpw-code-execution(44181)"]},"summary":"Untrusted search path vulnerability in ingvalidpw in Ingres 2.6, Ingres 2006 release 1 (aka 9.0.4), and Ingres 2006 release 2 (aka 9.1.0) on Linux and HP-UX allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted shared library, related to a \"pointer overwrite vulnerability.\" Fixes are available for the current release of Ingres 2006 release 2 (9.1.0), for Ingres 2006 release 1 (9.0.4), and for Ingres 2.6 versions on their respective platforms.
