However, because it is from a well-known researcher, it is being assigned a CVE identifier for tracking purposes.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:google:chrome:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:google:chrome:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:google:chrome:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
