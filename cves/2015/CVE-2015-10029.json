If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2015-10029","impact":{},"last-modified":"2023-01-12T20:07:00","references":["https://vuldb.com/?ctiid.217630","https://github.com/kelvinmo/simplexrd/commit/4c9f2e028523ed705b555eca2c18c64e71f1a35d","https://github.com/kelvinmo/simplexrd/releases/tag/v3.1.1","https://vuldb.com/?id.217630"],"summary":"A vulnerability classified as problematic was found in kelvinmo simplexrd up to 3.1.0.
