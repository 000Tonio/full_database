Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":9,"cvss-time":"2017-11-08T15:53:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2015-5164","impact":{"availability":"COMPLETE","confidentiality":"COMPLETE","integrity":"COMPLETE"},"last-modified":"2017-11-08T15:53:00","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1247732","https://pulp.plan.io/issues/23"],"refmap":{"confirm":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1247732","https://pulp.plan.io/issues/23"]},"summary":"The Qpid server on Red Hat Satellite 6 does not properly restrict message types, which allows remote authenticated users with administrative access on a managed content host to execute arbitrary code via a crafted message, related to a pickle processing problem in pulp.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:pulpproject:qpid:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:pulpproject:qpid:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:redhat:satellite:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:redhat:satellite:6.0:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:pulpproject:qpid:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
