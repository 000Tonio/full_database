If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2020-03-10T14:53:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2015-7968","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2020-03-10T14:53:00","references":["https://labs.integrity.pt/advisories/cve-2015-7968/"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://labs.integrity.pt/advisories/cve-2015-7968/"]},"summary":"nwbc_ext2int in SAP NetWeaver Application Server before Security Note 2183189 allows XXE attacks for local file inclusion via the sap/bc/ui2/nwbc/nwbc_ext2int/ URI.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver_application_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver_application_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:sap:netweaver_application_server:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
