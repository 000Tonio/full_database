If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":null,"cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2015-8031","impact":{},"last-modified":"2022-07-27T17:40:00","references":["https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j3h2-8mf8-j5r2","https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-ORGJVNETHUDSONMAIN-31221","https://wiki.eclipse.org/Hudson-ci/alerts/CVE-2015-8031"],"summary":"Hudson (aka org.jvnet.hudson.main:hudson-core) before 3.3.2 allows XXE attacks.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:hudson:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:hudson:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:eclipse:hudson:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
