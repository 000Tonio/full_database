If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2019-07-11T13:39:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2015-3907","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2019-07-11T13:39:00","references":["https://kb.hitcon.org/post/127839729207/codeigniter-rest-server-module-xxe-cve-2015-3907"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://kb.hitcon.org/post/127839729207/codeigniter-rest-server-module-xxe-cve-2015-3907"]},"summary":"CodeIgniter Rest Server (aka codeigniter-restserver) 2.7.1 allows XXE attacks.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:codeigniter-restserver_project:codeigniter-restserver:2.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:codeigniter-restserver_project:codeigniter-restserver:2.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:codeigniter-restserver_project:codeigniter-restserver:2.7.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
