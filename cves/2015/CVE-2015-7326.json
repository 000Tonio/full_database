If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2018-10-09T19:58:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2015-7326","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-10-09T19:58:00","references":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/134178/Milton-Webdav-2.7.0.1-XXE-Injection.html","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/536813/100/0/threaded","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/77392","https://github.com/miltonio/milton2/commit/5f81b0c48a817d4337d8b0e99ea0b4744ecd720b","https://github.com/miltonio/milton2/commit/b41072b","https://github.com/miltonio/milton2/commit/b5851c1"],"refmap":{"bid":["77392"],"bugtraq":["20151102 CVE-2015-7326 (XXE vulnerability in Milton Webdav)"],"confirm":["https://github.com/miltonio/milton2/commit/5f81b0c48a817d4337d8b0e99ea0b4744ecd720b","https://github.com/miltonio/milton2/commit/b41072b","https://github.com/miltonio/milton2/commit/b5851c1"],"misc":["http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/134178/Milton-Webdav-2.7.0.1-XXE-Injection.html"]},"summary":"XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in Milton Webdav before 2.7.0.3.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:milton:webdav:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:milton:webdav:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:milton:webdav:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
