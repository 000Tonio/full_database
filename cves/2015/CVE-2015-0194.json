If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2017-08-14T17:15:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2015-0194","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2017-08-14T17:15:00","references":["http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/73401","http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1IT06733","http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21699482"],"refmap":{"aixapar":["IT06733"],"bid":["73401"],"confirm":["http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21699482"]},"summary":"XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability in IBM Sterling B2B Integrator 5.1 and 5.2 and IBM Sterling File Gateway 2.1 and 2.2 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a crafted XML data.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:sterling_b2b_integrator:5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:sterling_b2b_integrator:5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:sterling_b2b_integrator:5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:sterling_b2b_integrator:5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:sterling_file_gateway:2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:sterling_file_gateway:2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:sterling_file_gateway:2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:ibm:sterling_file_gateway:2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:ibm:sterling_b2b_integrator:5.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ibm:sterling_b2b_integrator:5.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ibm:sterling_file_gateway:2.1:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","cpe:2.3:a:ibm:sterling_file_gateway:2.2:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
