Developers leverage serialization in order to convert data or state into a static, binary format for saving to disk or transferring over a network. These objects are then deserialized when needed to recover the data/state. By injecting a malformed object into a vulnerable application, an adversary can potentially compromise the application by manipulating the deserialization process. This can result in a number of unwanted outcomes, including remote code execution."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2018-04-24T15:28:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-502","id":"CVE-2015-2020","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-04-24T15:28:00","references":["https://alephsecurity.com/vulns/aleph-2015006","https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot15/woot15-paper-peles.pdf"],"refmap":{"misc":["https://alephsecurity.com/vulns/aleph-2015006","https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/woot15/woot15-paper-peles.pdf"]},"summary":"The MyScript SDK before 1.3 for Android might allow attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging a finalize method in a Serializable class that improperly passes an attacker-controlled pointer to a native function.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:myscript:myscript:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:myscript:myscript:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:myscript:myscript:*:*:*:*:*:android:*:*"]}
