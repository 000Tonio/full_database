If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":4,"cvss-time":"2017-09-09T20:41:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2015-3160","impact":{"availability":"NONE","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"NONE"},"last-modified":"2017-09-09T20:41:00","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2015/05/08/1","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/74569","https://beaker-project.org/jenkins-results/beaker-review-checks-docs/995/documentation/_build/html/whats-new/release-20.html#beaker-20-1","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=1020003","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1215020"],"refmap":{"bid":["74569"],"confirm":["https://beaker-project.org/jenkins-results/beaker-review-checks-docs/995/documentation/_build/html/whats-new/release-20.html#beaker-20-1","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/attachment.cgi?id=1020003","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1215020"],"mlist":["[oss-security] 20150507 beaker vulns fixed in version 20.1"]},"summary":"XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in bkr/server/jobs.py in Beaker before 20.1 allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information via submitting job XML to the server containing entity references which reference files from the Beaker server's file system.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:beaker-project:beaker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:beaker-project:beaker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:beaker-project:beaker:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
