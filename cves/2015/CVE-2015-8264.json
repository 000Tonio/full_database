The adversary can either modify the search path a program uses, like a PATH variable or classpath, or they can manipulate resources on the path to point to their malicious components. J2EE applications and other component based applications that are built from multiple binaries can have very long list of dependencies to execute. If one of these libraries and/or references is controllable by the attacker then application controls can be circumvented by the attacker."}],"cvss":6.8,"cvss-time":"2018-10-09T19:58:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-426","id":"CVE-2015-8264","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2018-10-09T19:58:00","references":["http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2016/Mar/64","http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/537803/100/0/threaded","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/79657","https://www.f-secure.com/en/web/labs_global/fsc-2015-4"],"refmap":{"bid":["79657"],"bugtraq":["20160315 Defense in depth -- the Microsoft way (part 39): vulnerabilities, please meet the bar for security servicing"],"confirm":["https://www.f-secure.com/en/web/labs_global/fsc-2015-4"],"fulldisc":["20160317 Defense in depth -- the Microsoft way (part 39): vulnerabilities, please meet the bar for security servicing"]},"summary":"Untrusted search path vulnerability in F-Secure Online Scanner allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code and conduct DLL hijacking attacks via a Trojan horse DLL that is located in the same folder as F-SecureOnlineScanner.exe.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:a:f-secure:f-secure_online_scanner:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:a:f-secure:f-secure_online_scanner:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:a:f-secure:f-secure_online_scanner:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
