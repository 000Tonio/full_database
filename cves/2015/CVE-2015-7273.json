If external entities are needed, then implement a custom XmlResolver that has a request timeout, data retrieval limit, and restrict resources it can retrieve locally.","summary":"This attack takes advantage of the entity replacement property of XML where the value of the replacement is a URI. A well-crafted XML document could have the entity refer to a URI that consumes a large amount of resources to create a denial of service condition. This can cause the system to either freeze, crash, or execute arbitrary code depending on the URI."}],"cvss":7.5,"cvss-time":"2017-04-14T13:26:00","cvss-vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cwe":"CWE-611","id":"CVE-2015-7273","impact":{"availability":"PARTIAL","confidentiality":"PARTIAL","integrity":"PARTIAL"},"last-modified":"2017-04-14T13:26:00","references":["http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/extras/m/white_papers/20441859"],"refmap":{"misc":["http://en.community.dell.com/techcenter/extras/m/white_papers/20441859"]},"summary":"Dell Integrated Remote Access Controller (iDRAC) 7/8 before 2.21.21.21 has XXE.","vulnerable_configuration":[{"id":"cpe:2.3:o:dell:integrated_remote_access_controller_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:o:dell:integrated_remote_access_controller_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:dell:integrated_remote_access_controller_7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:dell:integrated_remote_access_controller_7:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"},{"id":"cpe:2.3:h:dell:integrated_remote_access_controller_8:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*","title":"cpe:2.3:h:dell:integrated_remote_access_controller_8:-:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"}],"vulnerable_configuration_cpe_2_2":[],"vulnerable_product":["cpe:2.3:o:dell:integrated_remote_access_controller_firmware:*:*:*:*:*:*:*:*"]}
