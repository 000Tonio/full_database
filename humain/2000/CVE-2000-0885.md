Buffer overflows in Microsoft Network Monitor (Netmon) allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a long Browser Name in a CIFS Browse Frame, a long SNMP community name, or a long username or filename in an SMB session, aka the "Netmon Protocol Parsing" vulnerability.  NOTE: It is highly likely that this candidate will be split into multiple candidates.
