The xp_updatecolvbm function in SQL Server and Microsoft SQL Server Desktop Engine (MSDE) does not properly restrict the length of a buffer before calling the srv_paraminfo function in the SQL Server API for Extended Stored Procedures (XP), which allows an attacker to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary commands, aka the "Extended Stored Procedure Parameter Parsing" vulnerability.
