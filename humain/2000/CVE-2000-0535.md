# CVE-2000-0535

- Published: 2000-06-12T04:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-10T19:05:00

OpenSSL 0.9.4 and OpenSSH for FreeBSD do not properly check for the existence of the /dev/random or /dev/urandom devices, which are absent on FreeBSD Alpha systems, which causes them to produce weak keys which may be more easily broken.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
