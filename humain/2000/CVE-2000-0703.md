# CVE-2000-0703

- Published: 2000-10-20T04:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-10T19:05:00

suidperl (aka sperl) does not properly cleanse the escape sequence "~!" before calling /bin/mail to send an error report, which allows local users to gain privileges by setting the "interactive" environmental variable and calling suidperl with a filename that contains the escape sequence.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |
