# CVE-2004-2044

- Published: 2004-06-01T04:00:00

PHP-Nuke 7.3, and other products that use the PHP-Nuke codebase such as the Nuke Cops betaNC PHP-Nuke Bundle, OSCNukeLite 3.1, and OSC2Nuke 7x do not properly use the eregi() PHP function with $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] to identify the calling script, which allows remote attackers to directly access scripts, obtain path information via a PHP error message, and possibly gain access, as demonstrated using an HTTP request that contains the "admin.php" string.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
