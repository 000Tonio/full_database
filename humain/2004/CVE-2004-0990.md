# CVE-2004-0990

- Published: 2005-03-01T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:29:00

Integer overflow in GD Graphics Library libgd 2.0.28 (libgd2), and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via PNG image files with large image rows values that lead to a heap-based buffer overflow in the gdImageCreateFromPngCtx function, a different set of vulnerabilities than CVE-2004-0941.
