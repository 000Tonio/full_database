- Published: 2004-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2021-07-23T15:12:00

Hastymail 1.0.1 and earlier (stable) and 1.1 and earlier (development) does not send the "attachment" parameter in the Content-Disposition field for attachments, which causes the attachment to be rendered inline by Internet Explorer when the victim clicks the download link, which facilitates cross-site scripting (XSS) and possibly other attacks.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
