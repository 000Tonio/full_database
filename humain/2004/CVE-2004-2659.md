# CVE-2004-2659

- Published: 2004-12-31T05:00:00

Opera offers an Open button to verify that a user wishes to execute a downloaded file, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to construct a race condition that tricks a user into clicking Open via a request for a different mouse or keyboard action very shortly before the Open dialog appears.  NOTE: this is a different issue than CVE-2005-2407.
