Multiple buffer overflows in Ipswitch WS_FTP Server 4.0.2 (1) allow remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code by causing a large error string to be generated by the ALLO handler, or (2) may allow remote FTP administrators to execute arbitrary code by causing a long hostname or username to be inserted into a reply to a STAT command while a file is being transferred.
