# CVE-2004-0814

- Published: 2004-12-23T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:29:00

Multiple race conditions in the terminal layer in Linux 2.4.x, and 2.6.x before 2.6.9, allow (1) local users to obtain portions of kernel data via a TIOCSETD ioctl call to a terminal interface that is being accessed by another thread, or (2) remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) by switching from console to PPP line discipline, then quickly sending data that is received during the switch.

### CVSS Score: **1.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
