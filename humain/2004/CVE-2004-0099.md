mksnap_ffs in FreeBSD 5.1 and 5.2 only sets the snapshot flag when creating a snapshot for a file system, which causes default values for other flags to be used, possibly disabling security-critical settings and allowing a local user to bypass intended access restrictions.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
