rexecd for AIX 4.3.3 does not properly use a local copy of the pwd structure when calling getpwnam, which may cause the structure to be overwritten by the authenticate function and assign privileges to the wrong user.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
