- Published: 2004-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:31:00

Validate-Before-Canonicalize vulnerability in the checkURI function in functions.inc.php in PHPX 3.0 through 3.2.6 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via hex-encoded tags, which bypass the check for literal "<", ">", "(", and ")" characters, as demonstrated using the limit parameter to forums.php and a variety of other vectors.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
