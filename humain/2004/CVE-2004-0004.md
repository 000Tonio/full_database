# CVE-2004-0004

- Published: 2004-02-17T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-10-10T01:30:00

The libCheckSignature function in crypto-utils.lib for OpenCA 0.9.1.6 and earlier only compares the serial of the signer's certificate and the one in the database, which can cause OpenCA to incorrectly accept a signature if the certificate's chain is trusted by OpenCA's chain directory, allowing remote attackers to spoof requests from other users.
