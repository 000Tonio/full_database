# CVE-2004-2264

- Published: 2004-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:31:00

** DISPUTED ** Format string bug in the open_altfile function in filename.c for GNU less 382, 381, and 358 might allow local users to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code via format strings in the LESSOPEN environment variable. NOTE: since less is not setuid or setgid, then this is not a vulnerability unless there are plausible scenarios under which privilege boundaries could be crossed.
