# CVE-2004-1029

- Published: 2005-03-01T05:00:00

The Sun Java Plugin capability in Java 2 Runtime Environment (JRE) 1.4.2_01, 1.4.2_04, and possibly earlier versions, does not properly restrict access between Javascript and Java applets during data transfer, which allows remote attackers to load unsafe classes and execute arbitrary code by using the reflection API to access private Java packages.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
