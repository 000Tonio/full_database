# CVE-2004-2340

** UNVERIFIABLE **  SQL injection vulnerability in PunkBuster Screenshot Database (PB-DB) Alpha 6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the username and password fields of the login form.  NOTE: the original vulnerability report contains several significant inconsistencies that make it unclear whether the report is accurate, including (1) PB-DB is really the "PunkBuster Screenshot Database" and not "PunkBuster" itself; (2) there is no apparent association between PunkBuster and "Punky Brewster"; (3) the claimed source code is not anywhere in Alpha 6.
