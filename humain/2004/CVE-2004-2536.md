# CVE-2004-2536

- Published: 2004-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:31:00

The exit_thread function (process.c) in Linux kernel 2.6 through 2.6.5 does not invalidate the per-TSS io_bitmap pointers if a process obtains IO access permissions from the ioperm function but does not drop those permissions when it exits, which allows other processes to access the per-TSS pointers, access restricted memory locations, and possibly gain privileges.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
