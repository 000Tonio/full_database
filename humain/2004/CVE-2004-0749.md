# CVE-2004-0749

- Published: 2004-12-23T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:30:00

The mod_authz_svn module in Subversion 1.0.7 and earlier does not properly restrict access to all metadata on unreadable paths, which could allow remote attackers to gain sensitive information via (1) svn log -v, (2) svn propget, or (3) svn blame, and other commands that follow renames.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
