- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:32:00

Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in Sambar Server 6.1 Beta 2 on Windows, and possibly other versions on Linux, when the administrative IP address restrictions have been modified from the default, allow remote authenticated users to read arbitrary files via (1) a "..\" (dot dot backslash) in the file parameter to showini.asp, or (2) an absolute path with drive letter in the log parameter to showlog.asp.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
