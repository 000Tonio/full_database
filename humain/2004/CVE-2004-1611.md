# CVE-2004-1611

- Published: 2004-10-18T04:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:31:00

SalesLogix 6.1 does not verify if a user is authenticated before performing sensitive operations, which could allow remote attackers to (1) execute arbitrary SLX commands on the server or spoof the server via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, or (2) obtain the database password via a GetConnection request to TCP port 1707.

### CVSS Score: **5.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
