- Published: 2005-01-27T05:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-10T19:28:00

Postfix on Mac OS X 10.3.x through 10.3.5, with SMTPD AUTH enabled, does not properly clear the username between authentication attempts, which allows users with the longest username to prevent other valid users from being able to authenticate.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
