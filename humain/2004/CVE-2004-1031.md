fcronsighup in Fcron 2.0.1, 2.9.4, and possibly earlier versions allows local users to bypass access restrictions and load an arbitrary configuration file by starting an suid process and pointing the fcronsighup configuration file to a /proc entry that is owned by root but modifiable by the user, such as /proc/self/cmdline or /proc/self/environ.
