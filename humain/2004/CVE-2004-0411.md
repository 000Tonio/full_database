The URI handlers in Konqueror for KDE 3.2.2 and earlier do not properly filter "-" characters that begin a hostname in a (1) telnet, (2) rlogin, (3) ssh, or (4) mailto URI, which allows remote attackers to manipulate the options that are passed to the associated programs, possibly to read arbitrary files or execute arbitrary code.
