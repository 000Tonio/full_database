Buffer overflow in Microsoft Word 2002 (10.6612.6714) SP3, and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application exception) and possibly execute arbitrary code in winword.exe via certain unexpected values in a .doc file, including (1) an offset that triggers an out-of-bounds memory access, (2) a certain value that causes a large memory copy as triggered by an integer conversion error, and other values.
