The remove method in a stateful Enterprise JavaBean (EJB) in BEA WebLogic Server and WebLogic Express version 8.1 through SP2, 7.0 through SP4, and 6.1 through SP6, does not properly check EJB permissions before unexporting a bean, which allows remote authenticated users to remove EJB objects from remote views before the security exception is thrown.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
