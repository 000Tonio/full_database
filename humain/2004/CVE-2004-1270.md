lppasswd in CUPS 1.1.22, when run in environments that do not ensure that file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 are open when lppasswd is called, does not verify that the passwd.new file is different from STDERR, which allows local users to control output to passwd.new via certain user input that triggers an error message.
