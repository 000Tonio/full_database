changepassword.cgi in Neoteris Instant Virtual Extranet (IVE) 3.x and 4.x, with LDAP authentication or NT domain authentication enabled, does not limit the number of times a bad password can be entered, which allows remote attackers to guess passwords via a brute force attack.

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
