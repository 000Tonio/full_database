Internet Explorer 5.01 through 6 allows remote attackers to spoof arbitrary web sites by injecting content from one window into another window whose name is known but resides in a different domain, as demonstrated using a pop-up window on a trusted web site, aka the "window injection" vulnerability.  NOTE: later research shows that Internet Explorer 7 on Windows XP SP2 is also vulnerable.
