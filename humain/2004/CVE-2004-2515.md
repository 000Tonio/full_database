# CVE-2004-2515

- Published: 2004-12-31T05:00:00

Format string vulnerability in VMware Workstation 4.5.2 build-8848, if running with elevated privileges, might allow local users to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in command line arguments. NOTE: it is not clear if there are any default or typical circumstances under which VMware would be running with privileges beyond those already available to the attackers, so this might not be a vulnerability.
