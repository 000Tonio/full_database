# CVE-2004-1187

- Published: 2005-01-10T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:30:00

Heap-based buffer overflow in the pnm_get_chunk function for xine 0.99.2, and other packages such as MPlayer that use the same code, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via long PNA_TAG values, a different vulnerability than CVE-2004-1188.
