# CVE-2004-1897

- Published: 2004-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:31:00

Administration interface in Monit 1.4 through 4.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) by sending a Basic Authentication request without a password, which causes Monit to decrement a null pointer and perform an out-of-bounds read.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
