# CVE-2004-0172

- Published: 2004-03-15T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:29:00

Heap-based buffer overflow in the search_for_command function of ltrace 0.3.10, if it is installed setuid, could allow local users to execute arbitrary code via a long filename.  NOTE: It is unclear whether there are any packages that install ltrace as a setuid program, so this candidate might be REJECTed.
