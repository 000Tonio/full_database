Certain third-party packages for CVSup 16.1h, such as SuSE Linux, contain untrusted paths in the ELF RPATH fields of certain executables, which could allow local users to execute arbitrary code by causing cvsup to link against malicious libraries that are created in world-writable directories such as /usr/src/packages.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
