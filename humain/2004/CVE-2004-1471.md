# CVE-2004-1471

- Published: 2004-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:31:00

Format string vulnerability in wrapper.c in CVS 1.12.x through 1.12.8, and 1.11.x through 1.11.16 allows remote attackers with CVSROOT commit access to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in a wrapper line. Failed exploit attempts will likely cause a denial of service condition.
