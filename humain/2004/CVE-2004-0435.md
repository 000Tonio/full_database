# CVE-2004-0435

- Published: 2004-08-18T04:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:30:00

Certain "programming errors" in the msync system call for FreeBSD 5.2.1 and earlier, and 4.10 and earlier, do not properly handle the MS_INVALIDATE operation, which leads to cache consistency problems that allow a local user to prevent certain changes to files from being committed to disk.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
