fcronsighup in Fcron 2.0.1, 2.9.4, and possibly earlier versions allows local users to delete arbitrary files or create arbitrary empty files via a target filename with a large number of leading slash (/) characters such that fcronsighup does not properly append the intended fcrontab.sig to the resulting string.
