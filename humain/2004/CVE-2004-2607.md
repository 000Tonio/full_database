# CVE-2004-2607

- Published: 2004-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2010-04-02T04:50:00

A numeric casting discrepancy in sdla_xfer in Linux kernel 2.6.x up to 2.6.5 and 2.4 up to 2.4.29-rc1 allows local users to read portions of kernel memory via a large len argument, which is received as an int but cast to a short, which prevents a read loop from filling a buffer.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
