# CVE-2004-1865

- Published: 2004-03-26T05:00:00

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the administration panel in bBlog 0.7.2 allows remote authenticated users with superuser privileges to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a blog name ($blogname).  NOTE: if administrators are normally allowed to add HTML by other means, e.g. through Smarty templates, then this issue would not give any additional privileges, and thus would not be considered a vulnerability.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
