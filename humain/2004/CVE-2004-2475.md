# CVE-2004-2475

- Published: 2004-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:31:00

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Google Toolbar 2.0.114.1 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script via about.html in the About section.  NOTE: some followup posts suggest that the demonstration code's use of the res:// protocol does not cross privilege boundaries, since it is not allowed in the Internet Zone. Thus this might not be a vulnerability.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
