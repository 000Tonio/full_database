# CVE-2004-1101

- Published: 2005-01-10T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:30:00

mailpost.exe in MailPost 5.1.1sv, and possibly earlier versions, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (server crash), leak sensitive pathname information in the resulting error message, and execute a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack via an HTTP request that contains a / (backslash) and arbitrary webscript before the requested file, which leaks the pathname and does not quote the script in the resulting Visual Basic error message.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | PARTIAL |
