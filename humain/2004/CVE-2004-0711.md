# CVE-2004-0711

- Published: 2004-07-27T04:00:00

The URL pattern matching feature in BEA WebLogic Server 6.x matches illegal patterns ending in "*" as wildcards as if they were the legal "/*" pattern, which could cause WebLogic 7.x to allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions because the illegal patterns are properly rejected.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
