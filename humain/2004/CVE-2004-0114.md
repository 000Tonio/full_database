# CVE-2004-0114

- Published: 2004-03-03T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-10-10T01:30:00

The shmat system call in the System V Shared Memory interface for FreeBSD 5.2 and earlier, NetBSD 1.3 and earlier, and OpenBSD 2.6 and earlier, does not properly decrement a shared memory segment's reference count when the vm_map_find function fails, which could allow local users to gain read or write access to a portion of kernel memory and gain privileges.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
