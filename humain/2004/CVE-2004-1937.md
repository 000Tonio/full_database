Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in Nuked-KlaN 1.4b and 1.5b allow remote attackers to read or include arbitrary files via .. sequences in (1) the user_langue parameter to index.php or (2) the langue parameter to update.php, or modify arbitrary GLOBAL variables by causing globals.php to be loaded before conf.inc.php via (3) .. sequences in the file parameter with the page parameter set to globals, or (4) ../globals.php in the user_langue parameter, as demonstrated by modifying $nuked[prefix] in the Suggest module.

### CVSS Score: **5**
