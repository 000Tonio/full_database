# CVE-2004-1066

- Published: 2005-01-10T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:30:00

The cmdline pseudofiles in (1) procfs on FreeBSD 4.8 through 5.3, and (2) linprocfs on FreeBSD 5.x through 5.3, do not properly validate a process argument vector, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) or read portions of kernel memory.  NOTE: this candidate might be SPLIT into 2 separate items in the future.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | PARTIAL |
