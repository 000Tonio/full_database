Titan FTP Server version 3.01 build 163, and possibly other versions before build 169, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (crash) by disconnecting from the system during a "LIST -L" command, which causes Titan to access an invalid socket.

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
