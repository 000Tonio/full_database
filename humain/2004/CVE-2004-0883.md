Multiple vulnerabilities in the samba filesystem (smbfs) in Linux kernel 2.4 and 2.6 allow remote samba servers to cause a denial of service (crash) or gain sensitive information from kernel memory via a samba server (1) returning more data than requested to the smb_proc_read function, (2) returning a data offset from outside the samba packet to the smb_proc_readX function, (3) sending a certain TRANS2 fragmented packet to the smb_receive_trans2 function, (4) sending a samba packet with a certain header size to the smb_proc_readX_data function, or (5) sending a certain packet based offset for the data in a packet to the smb_receive_trans2 function.
