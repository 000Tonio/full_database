rufsi.dll in Symantec Virus Detection allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long string to the GetPrivateProfileString function.  NOTE: this issue was originally reported as a buffer overflow, but that specific claim is disputed by the vendor, although a crash is acknowledged.
