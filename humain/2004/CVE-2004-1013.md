The argument parser of the FETCH command in Cyrus IMAP Server 2.2.x through 2.2.8 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via certain commands such as (1) "body[p", (2) "binary[p", or (3) "binary[p") that cause an index increment error that leads to an out-of-bounds memory corruption.
