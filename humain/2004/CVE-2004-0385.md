# CVE-2004-0385

- Published: 2004-06-01T04:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:30:00

Heap-based buffer overflow in Oracle 9i Application Server Web Cache 9.0.4.0.0, 9.0.3.1.0, 9.0.2.3.0, and 9.0.0.4.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long HTTP request method header to the Web Cache listener.  NOTE: due to the vagueness of the Oracle advisory, it is not clear whether there are additional issues besides this overflow, although the advisory alludes to multiple "vulnerabilities."
