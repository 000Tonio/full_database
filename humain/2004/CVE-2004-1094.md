- Published: 2005-01-10T05:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:30:00

Buffer overflow in InnerMedia DynaZip DUNZIP32.dll file version 5.00.03 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a ZIP file containing a file with a long filename, as demonstrated using (1) a .rjs (skin) file in RealPlayer 10 through RealPlayer 10.5 (6.0.12.1053), RealOne Player 1 and 2, (2) the Restore Backup function in CheckMark Software Payroll 2004/2005 3.9.6 and earlier, (3) CheckMark MultiLedger before 7.0.2, (4) dtSearch 6.x and 7.x, (5) mcupdmgr.exe and mghtml.exe in McAfee VirusScan 10 Build 10.0.21 and earlier, (6) IBM Lotus Notes before 6.5.5, and other products.  NOTE: it is unclear whether this is the same vulnerability as CVE-2004-0575, although the data manipulations are the same.
