# CVE-2004-0413

- Published: 2004-08-06T04:00:00

libsvn_ra_svn in Subversion 1.0.4 trusts the length field of (1) svn://, (2) svn+ssh://, and (3) other svn protocol URL strings, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) and possibly execute arbitrary code via an integer overflow that leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.

### CVSS Score: **10**
