- Published: 2005-01-10T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:29:00

Multiple vulnerabilities in libXpm for 6.8.1 and earlier, as used in XFree86 and other packages, include (1) multiple integer overflows, (2) out-of-bounds memory accesses, (3) directory traversal, (4) shell metacharacter, (5) endless loops, and (6) memory leaks, which could allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service (application crash), or execute arbitrary code via a certain XPM image file. NOTE: it is highly likely that this candidate will be SPLIT into other candidates in the future, per CVE's content decisions.
