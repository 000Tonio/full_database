# CVE-2004-0949

- Published: 2005-01-10T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:29:00

The smb_recv_trans2 function call in the samba filesystem (smbfs) in Linux kernel 2.4 and 2.6 does not properly handle the re-assembly of fragmented packets correctly, which could allow remote samba servers to (1) read arbitrary kernel information or (2) raise a counter value to an arbitrary number by sending the first part of the fragmented packet multiple times.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
