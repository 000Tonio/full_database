The buffer overflow trigger in Cisco Security Agent (CSA) before 4.0.3 build 728 waits five minutes for a user response before terminating the process, which could allow remote attackers to bypass the buffer overflow protection by sending additional buffer overflow attacks within the five minute timeout period.
