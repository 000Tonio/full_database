Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in WowBB Forum 1.61 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) sort_by or (2) page parameters to view_user.php, or the (3) forum_id parameter to view_topic.php.  NOTE: the sort_by vector was later reported to be present in WowBB 1.65.
