# CVE-2004-2107

- Published: 2004-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:31:00

Finjan SurfinGate 6.0 and 7.0, when running in proxy mode, does not authenticate FHTTP commands on TCP port 3141, which allows remote attackers to use the finjan-parameter-type header to (1) restart the service, (2) use the getlastmsg command to view log information, or (3) use the online command to force a policy update from the database server.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
