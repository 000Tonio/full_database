# CVE-2004-0564

- Published: 2004-12-23T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:30:00

Roaring Penguin pppoe (rp-ppoe), if installed or configured to run setuid root contrary to its design, allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files.  NOTE: the developer has publicly disputed the claim that this is a vulnerability because pppoe "is NOT designed to run setuid-root."  Therefore this identifier applies *only* to those configurations and installations under which pppoe is run setuid root despite the developer's warnings.
