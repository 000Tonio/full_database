# CVE-2004-0334

- Published: 2004-11-23T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:30:00

InnoMedia VideoPhone allows remote attackers to bypass Basic Authorization via an HTTP request to (1) videophone_admindetail.asp, (2) videophone_syscfg.asp, (3) videophone_upgrade.asp, or (4) videophone_sysctrl.asp that contains a trailing / (slash).  NOTE: the original report mentioned AXIS 2100 Network Camera, but this was likely a cut-and-paste error.

### CVSS Score: **5**
