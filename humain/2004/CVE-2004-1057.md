- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:29:00

Multiple drivers in Linux kernel 2.4.19 and earlier do not properly mark memory with the VM_IO flag, which causes incorrect reference counts and may lead to a denial of service (kernel panic) when accessing freed kernel pages.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| --- | --- | --- |
