Mozilla before 1.7.6, and Firefox before 1.0.1, allows remote attackers to spoof arbitrary web sites by injecting content from one window into a target window whose name is known but resides in a different domain, as demonstrated using a pop-up window on a trusted web site, aka the "window injection" vulnerability.
