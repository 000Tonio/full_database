# CVE-2004-1307

- Published: 2004-12-21T05:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:26:00

Integer overflow in the TIFFFetchStripThing function in tif_dirread.c for libtiff 3.6.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a TIFF file with the STRIPOFFSETS flag and a large number of strips, which causes a zero byte buffer to be allocated and leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.
