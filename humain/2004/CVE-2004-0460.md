Buffer overflow in the logging capability for the DHCP daemon (DHCPD) for ISC DHCP 3.0.1rc12 and 3.0.1rc13 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (server crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via multiple hostname options in (1) DISCOVER, (2) OFFER, (3) REQUEST, (4) ACK, or (5) NAK messages, which can generate a long string when writing to a log file.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
