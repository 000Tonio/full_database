SQL injection vulnerability in aspWebAlbum allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL statements via (1) the username field on the login page or (2) the cat parameter to album.asp.  NOTE: it was later reported that vector 1 affects aspWebAlbum 3.2, and the vector involves the txtUserName parameter in a processlogin action to album.asp, as reachable from the login action.
