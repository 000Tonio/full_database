# CVE-2004-0758

- Published: 2004-08-18T04:00:00

- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:29:00

Mozilla 1.5 through 1.7 allows a CA certificate to be imported even when their DN is the same as that of the built-in CA root certificate, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service to SSL pages because the malicious certificate is treated as invalid.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
