- Published: 2004-07-27T04:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:30:00

The WebLogic Authentication provider for BEA WebLogic Server and WebLogic Express 8.1 through SP2 and 7.0 through SP4 does not properly clear member relationships when a group is deleted, which can cause a new group with the same name to have the members of the old group, which allows group members to gain privileges.

### CVSS Score: **5.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
