FreeBSD 5.1 and earlier, and Mac OS X before 10.3.4, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion of memory buffers and system crash) via a large number of out-of-sequence TCP packets, which prevents the operating system from creating new connections.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
