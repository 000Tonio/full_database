# CVE-2004-0490

- Published: 2004-08-18T04:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:30:00

cPanel, when compiling Apache 1.3.29 and PHP with the mod_phpsuexec option, does not set the --enable-discard-path option, which causes php to use the SCRIPT_FILENAME variable to find and execute a script instead of the PATH_TRANSLATED variable, which allows local users to execute arbitrary PHP code as other users via a URL that references the attacker's script after the user's script, which executes the attacker's script with the user's privileges, a different vulnerability than CVE-2004-0529.
