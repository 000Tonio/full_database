# CVE-2004-2411

- Published: 2004-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:31:00

The CleanseMessage function in shop$db.asp for VP-ASP Shopping Cart 4.0 through 5.0 does not sufficiently cleanse inputs, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks that do not use <script> tags, as demonstrated via javascript in IMG tags to (1) the cat parameter in shopdisplayproducts.asp or (2) the msg parameter in shoperror.asp, and possibly other vectors.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
