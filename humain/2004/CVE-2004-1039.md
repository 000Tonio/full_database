The NFS mountd service on SCO UnixWare 7.1.1, 7.1.3, 7.1.4, and 7.0.1, and possibly other versions, when run from inetd, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion) via a series of requests, which causes inetd to launch a separate process for each request.

### CVSS Score: **5**
