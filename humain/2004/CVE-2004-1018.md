# CVE-2004-1018

- Published: 2005-01-10T05:00:00

- Modified: 2020-12-08T18:49:00

Multiple integer handling errors in PHP before 4.3.10 allow attackers to bypass safe mode restrictions, cause a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code via (1) a negative offset value to the shmop_write function, (2) an "integer overflow/underflow" in the pack function, or (3) an "integer overflow/underflow" in the unpack function.  NOTE: this issue was originally REJECTed by its CNA before publication, but that decision is in active dispute.  This candidate may change significantly in the future as a result of further discussion.
