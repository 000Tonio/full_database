Integer overflow in pnen3260.dll in RealPlayer 8 through 10.5 (6.0.12.1040) and earlier, and RealOne Player 1 or 2 on Windows or Mac OS, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a SMIL file and a .rm movie file with a large length field for the data chunk, which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.
