# CVE-2004-2394

- Published: 2004-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:31:00

Off-by-one error in passwd 0.68 and earlier, when using the --stdin option, causes passwd to use the first 78 characters of a password instead of the first 79, which results in a small reduction of the search space required for brute force attacks.
