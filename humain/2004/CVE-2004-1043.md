Internet Explorer 6.0 on Windows XP SP2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by using the "Related Topics" command in the Help ActiveX Control (hhctrl.ocx) to open a Help popup window containing the PCHealth tools.htm file in the local zone and injecting Javascript to be executed, as demonstrated using "writehta.txt" and the ADODB recordset, which saves a .HTA file to the local system, aka the "HTML Help ActiveX control Cross Domain Vulnerability."

### CVSS Score: **5**
