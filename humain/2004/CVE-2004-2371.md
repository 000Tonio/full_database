Multiple Red Storm web-based games, including Ghost Recon 1.4 and earlier, Desert Siege, and The Sum of all Fears 1.1.1.0 and earlier, do not properly check return values from certain functions, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (hang) via packets that contain text strings with incorrect size values.
