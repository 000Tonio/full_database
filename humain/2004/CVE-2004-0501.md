Outlook 2003 allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and cause Outlook to request a URL from a remote site via an HTML e-mail message containing a Vector Markup Language (VML) entity whose src parameter points to the remote site, which could allow remote attackers to know when a message has been read, verify valid e-mail addresses, and possibly leak other information.
