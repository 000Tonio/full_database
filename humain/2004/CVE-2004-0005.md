Multiple buffer overflows in Gaim 0.75 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) octal encoding in yahoo_decode that causes a null byte to be written beyond the buffer, (2) octal encoding in yahoo_decode that causes a pointer to reference memory beyond the terminating null byte, (3) a quoted printable string to the gaim_quotedp_decode MIME decoder that causes a null byte to be written beyond the buffer, and (4) quoted printable encoding in gaim_quotedp_decode that causes a pointer to reference memory beyond the terminating null byte.
