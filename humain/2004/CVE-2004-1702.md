# CVE-2004-1702

- Published: 2004-08-09T04:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:31:00

The AuthenticationDialogue function in cfservd for Cfengine 2.0.0 to 2.1.7p1 does not properly check the return value of the ReceiveTransaction function, which leads to a failed malloc call and triggers to a null dereference, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash).

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
