# CVE-2004-0461

- Published: 2004-08-06T04:00:00

The DHCP daemon (DHCPD) for ISC DHCP 3.0.1rc12 and 3.0.1rc13, when compiled in environments that do not provide the vsnprintf function, uses C include files that define vsnprintf to use the less safe vsprintf function, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities that enable a denial of service (server crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code.

### CVSS Score: **10**
