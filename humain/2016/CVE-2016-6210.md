sshd in OpenSSH before 7.3, when SHA256 or SHA512 are used for user password hashing, uses BLOWFISH hashing on a static password when the username does not exist, which allows remote attackers to enumerate users by leveraging the timing difference between responses when a large password is provided.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
