# CVE-2016-10530

- Published: 2018-05-31T20:29:00

The airbrake module 0.3.8 and earlier defaults to sending environment variables over HTTP. Environment variables can often times contain secret keys and other sensitive values. A malicious user could be on the same network as a regular user and intercept all the secret keys the user is sending. This goes against common best practice, which is to use HTTPS.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
