# CVE-2016-6831

- Published: 2017-01-10T15:59:00

- Modified: 2017-01-11T02:55:00

The "process-execute" and "process-spawn" procedures did not free memory correctly when the execve() call failed, resulting in a memory leak. This could be abused by an attacker to cause resource exhaustion or a denial of service. This affects all releases of CHICKEN up to and including 4.11 (it will be fixed in 4.12 and 5.0, which are not yet released).

### CVSS Score: **5**
