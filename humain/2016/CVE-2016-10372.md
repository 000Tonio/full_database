The Eir D1000 modem does not properly restrict the TR-064 protocol, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via TCP port 7547, as demonstrated by opening WAN access to TCP port 80, retrieving the login password (which defaults to the Wi-Fi password), and using the NewNTPServer feature.

### CVSS Score: **10**
