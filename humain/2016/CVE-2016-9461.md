# CVE-2016-9461

- Published: 2017-03-28T02:59:00

- Modified: 2019-10-09T23:20:00

Nextcloud Server before 9.0.52 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.4 are not properly verifying edit check permissions on WebDAV copy actions. The WebDAV endpoint was not properly checking the permission on a WebDAV COPY action. This allowed an authenticated attacker with access to a read-only share to put new files in there. It was not possible to modify existing files.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
