- Published: 2016-10-07T14:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

The makecontext function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.25 creates execution contexts incompatible with the unwinder on ARM EABI (32-bit) platforms, which might allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (hang), as demonstrated by applications compiled using gccgo, related to backtrace generation.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
