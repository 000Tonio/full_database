# CVE-2016-4472

- Published: 2016-06-30T17:59:00

- Modified: 2023-02-12T23:21:00

The overflow protection in Expat is removed by compilers with certain optimization settings, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted XML data. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-1283 and CVE-2015-2716.
