fxcodec/codec/fx_codec_jpx_opj.cpp in PDFium, as used in Google Chrome before 50.0.2661.75, does not properly implement the sycc420_to_rgb and sycc422_to_rgb functions, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via crafted JPEG 2000 data in a PDF document.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
