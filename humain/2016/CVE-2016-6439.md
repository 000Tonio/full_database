A vulnerability in the detection engine reassembly of HTTP packets for Cisco Firepower System Software before 6.0.1 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition due to the Snort process unexpectedly restarting. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of an HTTP packet stream. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP packet stream to the detection engine on the targeted device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition if the Snort process restarts and traffic inspection is bypassed or traffic is dropped.
