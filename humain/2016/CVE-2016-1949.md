Mozilla Firefox before 44.0.2 does not properly restrict the interaction between Service Workers and plugins, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via a crafted web site that triggers spoofed responses to requests that use NPAPI, as demonstrated by a request for a crossdomain.xml file.
