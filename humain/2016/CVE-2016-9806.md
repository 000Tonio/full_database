- Modified: 2023-01-17T21:05:00

Race condition in the netlink_dump function in net/netlink/af_netlink.c in the Linux kernel before 4.6.3 allows local users to cause a denial of service (double free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted application that makes sendmsg system calls, leading to a free operation associated with a new dump that started earlier than anticipated.
