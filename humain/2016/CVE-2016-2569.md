# CVE-2016-2569

- Published: 2016-02-27T05:59:00

- Modified: 2018-03-16T01:29:00

Squid 3.x before 3.5.15 and 4.x before 4.0.7 does not properly append data to String objects, which allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a long string, as demonstrated by a crafted HTTP Vary header.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
