include/functions_installer.inc.php in Serendipity through 2.0.5 is vulnerable to File Inclusion and a possible Code Execution attack during a first-time installation because it fails to sanitize the dbType POST parameter before adding it to an include() call in the bundled-libs/serendipity_generateFTPChecksums.php file.
