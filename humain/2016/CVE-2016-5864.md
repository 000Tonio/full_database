In an audio driver function in all Qualcomm products with Android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, or QRD Android, some parameters are from userspace, and if they are set to a large value, integer overflow is possible followed by buffer overflow. In another function, a missing check for a lower bound may result in an out of bounds memory access.
