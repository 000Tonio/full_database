# CVE-2016-6225

- Published: 2017-03-23T16:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

xbcrypt in Percona XtraBackup before 2.3.6 and 2.4.x before 2.4.5 does not properly set the initialization vector (IV) for encryption, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information from encrypted backup files via a Chosen-Plaintext attack. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-6394.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
