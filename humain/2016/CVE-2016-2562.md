- Published: 2016-03-01T11:59:00

- Modified: 2016-12-03T03:25:00

The checkHTTP function in libraries/Config.class.php in phpMyAdmin 4.5.x before 4.5.5.1 does not verify X.509 certificates from api.github.com SSL servers, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof these servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
