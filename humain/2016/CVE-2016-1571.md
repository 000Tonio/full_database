The paging_invlpg function in include/asm-x86/paging.h in Xen 3.3.x through 4.6.x, when using shadow mode paging or nested virtualization is enabled, allows local HVM guest users to cause a denial of service (host crash) via a non-canonical guest address in an INVVPID instruction, which triggers a hypervisor bug check.
