Hughes high-performance broadband satellite modems, models HN7740S DW7000 HN7000S/SM, are potentially vulnerable to improper input validation. The device's advanced status web page that is linked to from the basic status web page does not appear to properly parse malformed GET requests. This may lead to a denial of service.
