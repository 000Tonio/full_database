In /framework/modules/ecommerce/controllers/orderController.php of Exponent CMS 2.4.0, untrusted input is passed into selectObjectsBySql. The method selectObjectsBySql of class mysqli_database uses the injectProof method to prevent SQL injection, but this filter can be bypassed easily: it only sanitizes user input if there are odd numbers of ' or " characters. Impact is Information Disclosure.

### CVSS Score: **5**
