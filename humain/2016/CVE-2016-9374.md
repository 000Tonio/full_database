# CVE-2016-9374

- Published: 2016-11-17T05:59:00

In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.1 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.7, the AllJoyn dissector could crash with a buffer over-read, triggered by network traffic or a capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-alljoyn.c by ensuring that a length variable properly tracked the state of a signature variable.
