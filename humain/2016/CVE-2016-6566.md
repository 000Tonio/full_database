The valueAsString parameter inside the JSON payload contained by the ucLogin_txtLoginId_ClientStat POST parameter of the Sungard eTRAKiT3 software version 3.2.1.17 is not properly validated. An unauthenticated remote attacker may be able to modify the POST request and insert a SQL query which may then be executed by the backend server. eTRAKiT 3.2.1.17 was tested, but other versions may also be vulnerable.
