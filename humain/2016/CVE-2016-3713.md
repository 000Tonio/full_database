The msr_mtrr_valid function in arch/x86/kvm/mtrr.c in the Linux kernel before 4.6.1 supports MSR 0x2f8, which allows guest OS users to read or write to the kvm_arch_vcpu data structure, and consequently obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service (system crash), via a crafted ioctl call.
