- Published: 2017-01-31T19:59:00

- Modified: 2017-02-24T19:26:00

OpenNTPD before 6.0p1 does not validate the CN for HTTPS constraint requests, which allows remote attackers to bypass the man-in-the-middle mitigations via a crafted timestamp constraint with a valid certificate.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
