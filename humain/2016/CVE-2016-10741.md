# CVE-2016-10741

- Published: 2019-02-01T16:29:00

- Modified: 2019-04-18T15:20:00

In the Linux kernel before 4.9.3, fs/xfs/xfs_aops.c allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) because there is a race condition between direct and memory-mapped I/O (associated with a hole) that is handled with BUG_ON instead of an I/O failure.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
