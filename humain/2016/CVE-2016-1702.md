The SkRegion::readFromMemory function in core/SkRegion.cpp in Skia, as used in Google Chrome before 51.0.2704.79, does not validate the interval count, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via crafted serialized data.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
