Integer overflow in the net_tx_pkt_init function in hw/net/net_tx_pkt.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) allows local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (QEMU process crash) via the maximum fragmentation count, which triggers an unchecked multiplication and NULL pointer dereference.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
