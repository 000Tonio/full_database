WebKit/Source/bindings/modules/v8/V8BindingForModules.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 53.0.2785.113, does not properly consider getter side effects during array key conversion, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted Indexed Database (aka IndexedDB) API calls.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
