# CVE-2016-7127

- Published: 2016-09-12T01:59:00

- Modified: 2018-01-05T02:31:00

The imagegammacorrect function in ext/gd/gd.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before 7.0.10 does not properly validate gamma values, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) or possibly have unspecified other impact by providing different signs for the second and third arguments.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
