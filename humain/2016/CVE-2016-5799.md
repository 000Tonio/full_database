Moxa OnCell G3100V2 devices before 2.8 and G3111, G3151, G3211, and G3251 devices before 1.7 do not properly restrict authentication attempts, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access via a brute-force attack.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
