authd sets weak permissions for /etc/ident.key, which allows local users to obtain the key by leveraging a race condition between the creation of the key, and the chmod to protect it.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
