# CVE-2016-4049

- Published: 2016-05-23T19:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

The bgp_dump_routes_func function in bgpd/bgp_dump.c in Quagga does not perform size checks when dumping data, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon crash) via a large BGP packet.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
