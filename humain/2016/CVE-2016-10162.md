# CVE-2016-10162

- Published: 2017-01-24T21:59:00

The php_wddx_pop_element function in ext/wddx/wddx.c in PHP 7.0.x before 7.0.15 and 7.1.x before 7.1.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via an inapplicable class name in a wddxPacket XML document, leading to mishandling in a wddx_deserialize call.

### CVSS Score: **5**
