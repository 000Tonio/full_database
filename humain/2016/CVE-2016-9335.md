- Published: 2018-05-09T13:29:00

A hard-coded cryptographic key vulnerability was identified in Red Lion Controls Sixnet-Managed Industrial Switches running firmware Version 5.0.196 and Stride-Managed Ethernet Switches running firmware Version 5.0.190. Vulnerable versions of Stride-Managed Ethernet switches and Sixnet-Managed Industrial switches use hard-coded HTTP SSL/SSH keys for secure communication. Because these keys cannot be regenerated by users, all products use the same key. The attacker could disrupt communication or compromise the system. CVSS v3 base score: 10, CVSS vector string: (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). Red Lion Controls recommends updating to SLX firmware Version 5.3.174.
