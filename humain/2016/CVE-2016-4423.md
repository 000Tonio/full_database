# CVE-2016-4423

- Published: 2016-06-01T22:59:00

- Modified: 2016-06-03T14:50:00

The attemptAuthentication function in Component/Security/Http/Firewall/UsernamePasswordFormAuthenticationListener.php in Symfony before 2.3.41, 2.7.x before 2.7.13, 2.8.x before 2.8.6, and 3.0.x before 3.0.6 does not limit the length of a username stored in a session, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (session storage consumption) via a series of authentication attempts with long, non-existent usernames.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
