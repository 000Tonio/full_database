http.cc in Squid 4.x before 4.0.7 relies on the HTTP status code after a response-parsing failure, which allows remote HTTP servers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a malformed response.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
