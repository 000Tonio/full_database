Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 3.2, when multi-tenant SDN is enabled and a build is run in a namespace that would normally be isolated from pods in other namespaces, allows remote authenticated users to access network resources on restricted pods via an s2i build with a builder image that (1) contains ONBUILD commands or (2) does not contain a tar binary.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
