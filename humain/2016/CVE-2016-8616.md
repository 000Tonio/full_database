# CVE-2016-8616

- Published: 2018-08-01T06:29:00

A flaw was found in curl before version 7.51.0 When re-using a connection, curl was doing case insensitive comparisons of user name and password with the existing connections. This means that if an unused connection with proper credentials exists for a protocol that has connection-scoped credentials, an attacker can cause that connection to be reused if s/he knows the case-insensitive version of the correct password.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
