Siklu EtherHaul radios before 3.7.1 and 6.x before 6.9.0 have a built-in, hidden root account, with an unchangeable password that is the same across all devices. This account is accessible via both SSH and the device's web interface and grants access to the underlying embedded Linux OS on the device, allowing full control over it.

### CVSS Score: **10**
