The Chrome Instant feature in Google Chrome before 48.0.2564.109 does not ensure that a New Tab Page (NTP) navigation target is on the most-visited or suggestions list, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended restrictions via unspecified vectors, related to instant_service.cc and search_tab_helper.cc.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
