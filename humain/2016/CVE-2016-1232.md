The mod_dialback module in Prosody before 0.9.9 does not properly generate random values for the secret token for server-to-server dialback authentication, which makes it easier for attackers to spoof servers via a brute force attack. <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html">CWE-338: Use of Cryptographically Weak Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG)</a>

### CVSS Score: **5**
