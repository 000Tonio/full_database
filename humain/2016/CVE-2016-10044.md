# CVE-2016-10044

- Published: 2017-02-07T07:59:00

- Modified: 2023-01-17T21:40:00

The aio_mount function in fs/aio.c in the Linux kernel before 4.7.7 does not properly restrict execute access, which makes it easier for local users to bypass intended SELinux W^X policy restrictions, and consequently gain privileges, via an io_setup system call.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
