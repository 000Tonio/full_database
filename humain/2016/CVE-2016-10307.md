# CVE-2016-10307

- Published: 2017-03-30T07:59:00

Trango ApexLynx 2.0, ApexOrion 2.0, GigaLynx 2.0, GigaOrion 2.0, and StrataLink 3.0 devices have a built-in, hidden root account, with a default password for which the MD5 hash value is public (but the cleartext value is perhaps not yet public). This account is accessible via SSH and/or TELNET, and grants access to the underlying embedded UNIX OS on the device, allowing full control over it.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
