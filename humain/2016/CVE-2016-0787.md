# CVE-2016-0787

- Published: 2016-04-13T17:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

The diffie_hellman_sha256 function in kex.c in libssh2 before 1.7.0 improperly truncates secrets to 128 or 256 bits, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to decrypt or intercept SSH sessions via unspecified vectors, aka a "bits/bytes confusion bug."

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
