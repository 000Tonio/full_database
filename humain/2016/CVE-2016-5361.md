# CVE-2016-5361

- Published: 2016-06-16T14:59:00

programs/pluto/ikev1.c in libreswan before 3.17 retransmits in initial-responder states, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic amplification) via a spoofed UDP packet. NOTE: the original behavior complies with the IKEv1 protocol, but has a required security update from the libreswan vendor; as of 2016-06-10, it is expected that several other IKEv1 implementations will have vendor-required security updates, with separate CVE IDs assigned to each.

### CVSS Score: **5**
