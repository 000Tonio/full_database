# CVE-2016-6144

- Published: 2016-08-05T14:59:00

- Modified: 2016-11-28T20:30:00

The SQL interface in SAP HANA before Revision 102 does not limit the number of login attempts for the SYSTEM user when the password_lock_for_system_user is not supported or is configured as "False," which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass authentication via a brute force attack, aka SAP Security Note 2216869.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
