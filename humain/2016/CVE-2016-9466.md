Nextcloud Server before 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.6 and 9.1.2 suffer from Reflected XSS in the Gallery application. The gallery app was not properly sanitizing exception messages from the Nextcloud/ownCloud server. Due to an endpoint where an attacker could influence the error message, this led to a reflected Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability.
