security/keys/big_key.c in the Linux kernel before 4.8.7 mishandles unsuccessful crypto registration in conjunction with successful key-type registration, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and panic) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted application that uses the big_key data type.
