A10 AX1030 and possibly other devices with software before 2.7.2-P8 uses random GCM nonce generations, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain the authentication key and spoof data by leveraging a reused nonce in a session and a "forbidden attack," a similar issue to CVE-2016-0270.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
