By flooding a Juniper Networks router running Junos OS with specially crafted IPv6 traffic, all available resources can be consumed, leading to the inability to store next hop information for legitimate traffic. In extreme cases, the crafted IPv6 traffic may result in a total resource exhaustion and kernel panic. The issue is triggered by traffic destined to the router. Transit traffic does not trigger the vulnerability. This issue only affects devices with IPv6 enabled and configured. Devices not configured to process IPv6 traffic are unaffected by this vulnerability. This issue was found during internal product security testing. Juniper SIRT is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this vulnerability. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 11.4 prior to 11.4R13-S3; 12.3 prior to 12.3R3-S4; 12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D30; 13.3 prior to 13.3R10, 13.3R4-S11; 14.1 prior to 14.1R2-S8, 14.1R4-S12, 14.1R8; 14.1X53 prior to 14.1X53-D28, 14.1X53-D40; 14.1X55 prior to 14.1X55-D35; 14.2 prior to 14.2R3-S10, 14.2R4-S7, 14.2R6; 15.1 prior to 15.1F2-S5, 15.1F5-S2, 15.1F6, 15.1R3; 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D40; 15.1X53 prior to 15.1X53-D57, 15.1X53-D70.
