- Published: 2016-04-15T14:59:00

- Modified: 2016-04-25T13:58:00

The am_read_post_data function in mod_auth_mellon before 0.11.1 does not limit the amount of data read, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (worker process crash, web server deadlock, or memory consumption) via a large amount of POST data.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
