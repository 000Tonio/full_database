# CVE-2016-10517

- Published: 2017-10-24T18:29:00

- Modified: 2018-08-08T14:22:00

networking.c in Redis before 3.2.7 allows "Cross Protocol Scripting" because it lacks a check for POST and Host: strings, which are not valid in the Redis protocol (but commonly occur when an attack triggers an HTTP request to the Redis TCP port).

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
