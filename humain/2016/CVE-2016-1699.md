- Published: 2016-06-05T23:59:00

WebKit/Source/devtools/front_end/devtools.js in the Developer Tools (aka DevTools) subsystem in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 51.0.2704.79, does not ensure that the remoteFrontendUrl parameter is associated with a chrome-devtools-frontend.appspot.com URL, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a crafted URL.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
