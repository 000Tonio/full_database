# CVE-2016-8650

- Published: 2016-11-28T03:59:00

- Modified: 2023-02-12T23:26:00

The mpi_powm function in lib/mpi/mpi-pow.c in the Linux kernel through 4.8.11 does not ensure that memory is allocated for limb data, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack memory corruption and panic) via an add_key system call for an RSA key with a zero exponent.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
