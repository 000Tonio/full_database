ext/curl/interface.c in PHP 7.x before 7.0.10 does not work around a libcurl integer overflow, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (allocation error and heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long string that is mishandled in a curl_escape call.
