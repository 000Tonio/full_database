Apache Struts 2.0.0 through 2.3.24.1 does not properly cache method references when used with OGNL before 3.0.12, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (block access to a web site) via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
