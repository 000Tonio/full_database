The verify_certificate function in lib/vtls/schannel.c in libcurl 7.30.0 through 7.51.0, when built for Windows CE using the schannel TLS backend, allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service (crash), or possibly have unspecified other impact via a wildcard certificate name, which triggers an out-of-bounds read.
