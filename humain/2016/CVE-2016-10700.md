- Published: 2017-11-24T05:29:00

auth_login.php in Cacti before 1.0.0 allows remote authenticated users who use web authentication to bypass intended access restrictions by logging in as a user not in the cacti database, because the guest user is not considered. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-2313.
