hitek.jar in Hitek Software's Automize uses weak encryption when encrypting SSH/SFTP and Encryption profile passwords. This allows an attacker to retrieve the encrypted passwords from sshProfiles.jsd and encryptionProfiles.jsd and decrypt them to recover cleartext passwords. All 10.x up to and including 10.25 and all 11.x up to and including 11.14 are verified to be affected.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
