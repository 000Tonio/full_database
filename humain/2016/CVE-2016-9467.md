Nextcloud Server before 9.0.54 and 10.0.1 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.6 and 9.1.2 suffer from content spoofing in the files app. The location bar in the files app was not verifying the passed parameters. An attacker could craft an invalid link to a fake directory structure and use this to display an attacker-controlled error message to the user.
