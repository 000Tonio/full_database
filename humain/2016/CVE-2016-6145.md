The SQL interface in SAP HANA DB 1.00.091.00.1418659308 provides different error messages for failed login attempts depending on whether the username exists and is locked when the detailed_error_on_connect option is not supported or is configured as "False," which allows remote attackers to enumerate database users via a series of login attempts, aka SAP Security Note 2216869.

### CVSS Score: **5**
