- Published: 2016-05-20T14:59:00

- Modified: 2020-05-14T15:28:00

The get_cmd function in hw/scsi/esp.c in the 53C9X Fast SCSI Controller (FSC) support in QEMU does not properly check DMA length, which allows local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write and QEMU process crash) via unspecified vectors, involving an SCSI command.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
