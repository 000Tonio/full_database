The FrameLoader::startLoad function in WebKit/Source/core/loader/FrameLoader.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 51.0.2704.79, does not prevent frame navigations during DocumentLoader detach operations, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via crafted JavaScript code.
