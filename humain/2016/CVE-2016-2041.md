# CVE-2016-2041

- Published: 2016-02-20T01:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

libraries/common.inc.php in phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.13, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.3, and 4.5.x before 4.5.4 does not use a constant-time algorithm for comparing CSRF tokens, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by measuring time differences.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
