It was found that Samba before versions 4.5.3, 4.4.8, 4.3.13 always requested forwardable tickets when using Kerberos authentication. A service to which Samba authenticated using Kerberos could subsequently use the ticket to impersonate Samba to other services or domain users.

### CVSS Score: **3.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
