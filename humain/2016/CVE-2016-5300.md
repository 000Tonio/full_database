# CVE-2016-5300

- Published: 2016-06-16T18:59:00

- Modified: 2021-07-31T08:15:00

The XML parser in Expat does not use sufficient entropy for hash initialization, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted identifiers in an XML document.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-0876.
