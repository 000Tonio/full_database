# CVE-2016-5739

- Published: 2016-07-03T01:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

The Transformation implementation in phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3 does not use the no-referrer Content Security Policy (CSP) protection mechanism, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct CSRF attacks by reading an authentication token in a Referer header, related to libraries/Header.php.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
