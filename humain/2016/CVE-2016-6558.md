A command injection vulnerability exists in apply.cgi on the ASUS RP-AC52 access point, firmware version 1.0.1.1s and possibly earlier, web interface specifically in the action_script parameter. The action_script parameter specifies a script to be executed if the action_mode parameter does not contain a valid state. If the input provided by action_script does not match one of the hard coded options, then it will be executed as the argument of either a system() or an eval() call allowing arbitrary commands to be executed.
