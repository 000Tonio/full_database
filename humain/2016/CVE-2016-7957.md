# CVE-2016-7957

- Published: 2017-04-12T10:59:00

In Wireshark 2.2.0, the Bluetooth L2CAP dissector could crash, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-btl2cap.c by avoiding use of a seven-byte memcmp for potentially shorter strings.
