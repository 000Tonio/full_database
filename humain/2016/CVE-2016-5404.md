The cert_revoke command in FreeIPA does not check for the "revoke certificate" permission, which allows remote authenticated users to revoke arbitrary certificates by leveraging the "retrieve certificate" permission.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
