# CVE-2016-4467

- Published: 2017-05-02T14:59:00

- Modified: 2019-04-23T12:29:00

The C client and C-based client bindings in the Apache Qpid Proton library before 0.13.1 on Windows do not properly verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate when using the SChannel-based security layer, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
