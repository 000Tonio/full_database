The Imagely NextGen Gallery plugin for Wordpress prior to version 2.1.57 does not properly validate user input in the cssfile parameter of a HTTP POST request, which may allow an authenticated user to read arbitrary files from the server, or execute arbitrary code on the server in some circumstances (dependent on server configuration).
