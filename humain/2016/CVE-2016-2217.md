- Published: 2017-01-30T22:59:00

- Modified: 2017-07-01T01:29:00

The OpenSSL address implementation in Socat 1.7.3.0 and 2.0.0-b8 does not use a prime number for the DH, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain the shared secret.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
