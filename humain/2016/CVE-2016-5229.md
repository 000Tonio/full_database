Atlassian Bamboo before 5.11.4.1 and 5.12.x before 5.12.3.1 does not properly restrict permitted deserialized classes, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to XStream Serialization.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
