# CVE-2016-10398

- Published: 2017-07-17T13:18:00

Android 6.0 has an authentication bypass for attackers with root and physical access. Cryptographic authentication tokens (AuthTokens) used by the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) are protected by a weak challenge. This allows adversaries to replay previously captured responses and use the TEE without authenticating. All apps using authentication-gated cryptography are vulnerable to this attack, which was confirmed on the LG Nexus 5X.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
