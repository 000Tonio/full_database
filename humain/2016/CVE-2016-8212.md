# CVE-2016-8212

An issue was discovered in EMC RSA BSAFE Crypto-J versions prior to 6.2.2. There is an Improper OCSP Validation Vulnerability. OCSP responses have two time values: thisUpdate and nextUpdate. These specify a validity period; however, both values are optional. Crypto-J treats the lack of a nextUpdate as indicating that the OCSP response is valid indefinitely instead of restricting its validity for a brief period surrounding the thisUpdate time. This vulnerability is similar to the issue described in CVE-2015-4748.
