ext/session/session.c in PHP before 5.5.38, 5.6.x before 5.6.24, and 7.x before 7.0.9 does not properly maintain a certain hash data structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors related to session deserialization.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
