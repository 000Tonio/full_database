spl_array.c in the SPL extension in PHP before 5.5.37 and 5.6.x before 5.6.23 improperly interacts with the unserialize implementation and garbage collection, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (use-after-free and application crash) via crafted serialized data.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
