Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 3.2 and 3.1 do not properly validate the origin of a request when anonymous access is granted to a service/proxy or pod/proxy API for a specific pod, which allows remote attackers to access API credentials in the web browser localStorage via an access_token in the query parameter.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
