- Modified: 2016-12-31T02:59:00

KVM in the Linux kernel before 4.8.12, when I/O APIC is enabled, does not properly restrict the VCPU index, which allows guest OS users to gain host OS privileges or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access and host OS crash) via a crafted interrupt request, related to arch/x86/kvm/ioapic.c and arch/x86/kvm/ioapic.h.

### CVSS Score: **6.9**
