In Open vSwitch (OvS) 2.5.0, a malformed IP packet can cause the switch to read past the end of the packet buffer due to an unsigned integer underflow in `lib/flow.c` in the function `miniflow_extract`, permitting remote bypass of the access control list enforced by the switch.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
