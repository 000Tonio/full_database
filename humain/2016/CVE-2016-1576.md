# CVE-2016-1576

- Published: 2016-05-02T10:59:00

- Modified: 2022-04-18T17:59:00

The overlayfs implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.5.2 does not properly restrict the mount namespace, which allows local users to gain privileges by mounting an overlayfs filesystem on top of a FUSE filesystem, and then executing a crafted setuid program.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
