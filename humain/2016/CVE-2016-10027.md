Race condition in the XMPP library in Smack before 4.1.9, when the SecurityMode.required TLS setting has been set, allows man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass TLS protections and trigger use of cleartext for client authentication by stripping the "starttls" feature from a server response.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
