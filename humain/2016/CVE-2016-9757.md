In the Create Tags page of the Rapid7 Nexpose version 6.4.12 user interface, any authenticated user who has the capability to create tags can inject cross-site scripting (XSS) elements in the tag name field. Once this tag is viewed in the Tag Detail page of the Rapid7 Nexpose 6.4.12 UI by another authenticated user, the script is run in that user's browser context.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**
