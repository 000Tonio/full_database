- Published: 2016-04-27T17:59:00

- Modified: 2022-01-31T18:55:00

The adjust_branches function in kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel before 4.5 does not consider the delta in the backward-jump case, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory by creating a packet filter and then loading crafted BPF instructions.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
