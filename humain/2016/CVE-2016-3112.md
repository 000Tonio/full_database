client/consumer/cli.py in Pulp before 2.8.3 writes consumer private keys to etc/pki/pulp/consumer/consumer-cert.pem as world-readable, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain the consumer private keys and escalate privileges by reading /etc/pki/pulp/consumer/consumer-cert, and authenticating as a consumer user.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
