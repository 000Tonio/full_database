# CVE-2016-9372

- Published: 2016-11-17T05:59:00

- Modified: 2017-07-28T01:29:00

In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.1, the Profinet I/O dissector could loop excessively, triggered by network traffic or a capture file. This was addressed in plugins/profinet/packet-pn-rtc-one.c by rejecting input with too many I/O objects.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
