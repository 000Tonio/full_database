# CVE-2016-5228

- Published: 2016-07-03T01:59:00

- Modified: 2017-09-03T01:29:00

Stack-based buffer overflow in the PlayMacro function in ObjectXMacro.ObjectXMacro in WdMacCtl.ocx in Micro Focus Rumba 9.x before 9.3 HF 11997 and 9.4.x before 9.4 HF 12815 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long MacroName argument. NOTE: some references mention CVE-2016-5226 but that is not a correct ID for any Rumba vulnerability.
