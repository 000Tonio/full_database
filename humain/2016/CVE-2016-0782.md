- Published: 2016-08-05T15:59:00

The administration web console in Apache ActiveMQ 5.x before 5.11.4, 5.12.x before 5.12.3, and 5.13.x before 5.13.2 allows remote authenticated users to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and consequently obtain sensitive information from a Java memory dump via vectors related to creating a queue.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
