- Modified: 2023-02-12T23:18:00

Stack-based buffer overflow in the getaddrinfo function in sysdeps/posix/getaddrinfo.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via vectors involving hostent conversion. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-4458.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
