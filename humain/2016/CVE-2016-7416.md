# CVE-2016-7416

- Published: 2016-09-17T21:59:00

- Modified: 2018-05-04T01:29:00

ext/intl/msgformat/msgformat_format.c in PHP before 5.6.26 and 7.x before 7.0.11 does not properly restrict the locale length provided to the Locale class in the ICU library, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a MessageFormatter::formatMessage call with a long first argument.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
