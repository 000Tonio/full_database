sudo: It was discovered that the default sudo configuration on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and possibly other Linux implementations preserves the value of INPUTRC which could lead to information disclosure. A local user with sudo access to a restricted program that uses readline could use this flaw to read content from specially formatted files with elevated privileges provided by sudo.
