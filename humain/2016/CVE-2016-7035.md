# CVE-2016-7035

- Published: 2018-09-10T16:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-09T23:19:00

An authorization flaw was found in Pacemaker before 1.1.16, where it did not properly guard its IPC interface. An attacker with an unprivileged account on a Pacemaker node could use this flaw to, for example, force the Local Resource Manager daemon to execute a script as root and thereby gain root access on the machine.
