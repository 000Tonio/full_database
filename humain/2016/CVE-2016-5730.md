phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.16, 4.4.x before 4.4.15.7, and 4.6.x before 4.6.3 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via vectors involving (1) an array value to FormDisplay.php, (2) incorrect data to validate.php, (3) unexpected data to Validator.php, (4) a missing config directory during setup, or (5) an incorrect OpenID identifier data type, which reveals the full path in an error message.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
