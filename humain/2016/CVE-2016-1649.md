# CVE-2016-1649

- Published: 2016-03-29T10:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

The Program::getUniformInternal function in Program.cpp in libANGLE, as used in Google Chrome before 49.0.2623.108, does not properly handle a certain data-type mismatch, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted shader stages.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**
