# CVE-2016-3917

- Published: 2016-10-10T10:59:00

- Modified: 2016-11-28T20:13:00

The fingerprint login feature in Android 6.0.1 before 2016-10-01 and 7.0 before 2016-10-01 does not track the user account during the authentication process, which allows physically proximate attackers to authenticate as an arbitrary user by leveraging lockscreen access, aka internal bug 30744668.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
