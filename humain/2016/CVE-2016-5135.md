# CVE-2016-5135

- Published: 2016-07-23T19:59:00

WebKit/Source/core/html/parser/HTMLPreloadScanner.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 52.0.2743.82, does not consider referrer-policy information inside an HTML document during a preload request, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Content Security Policy (CSP) protection mechanism via a crafted web site, as demonstrated by a "Content-Security-Policy: referrer origin-when-cross-origin" header that overrides a "<META name='referrer' content='no-referrer'>" element.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
