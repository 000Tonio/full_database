Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Configurator component in Oracle Supply Chain Products Suite 12.0.6, 12.1, and 12.2 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality and integrity via vectors related to JRAD Heartbeat. NOTE: the previous information is from the April 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that that this issue involves multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via three unspecified parameters in an unknown JSP file.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
