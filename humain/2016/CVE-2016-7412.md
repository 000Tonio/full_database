ext/mysqlnd/mysqlnd_wireprotocol.c in PHP before 5.6.26 and 7.x before 7.0.11 does not verify that a BIT field has the UNSIGNED_FLAG flag, which allows remote MySQL servers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted field metadata.
