The logcheck function in session.inc in AlienVault OSSIM before 5.3.1, when an action has been created, and USM before 5.3.1 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and consequently obtain sensitive information, modify the application, or execute arbitrary code as root via an "AV Report Scheduler" HTTP User-Agent header.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
