Nextcloud Server before 9.0.52 & ownCloud Server before 9.0.4 are vulnerable to a content-spoofing attack in the files app. The location bar in the files app was not verifying the passed parameters. An attacker could craft an invalid link to a fake directory structure and use this to display an attacker-controlled error message to the user.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
