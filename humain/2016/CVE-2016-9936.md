# CVE-2016-9936

- Published: 2017-01-04T20:59:00

- Modified: 2018-05-04T01:29:00

The unserialize implementation in ext/standard/var.c in PHP 7.x before 7.0.14 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted serialized data.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-6834.
