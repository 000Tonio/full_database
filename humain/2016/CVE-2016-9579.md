A flaw was found in the way Ceph Object Gateway would process cross-origin HTTP requests if the CORS policy was set to allow origin on a bucket. A remote unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to cause denial of service by sending a specially-crafted cross-origin HTTP request. Ceph branches 1.3.x and 2.x are affected.
