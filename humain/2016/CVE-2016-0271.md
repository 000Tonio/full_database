The agents in IBM UrbanCode Deploy 6.x before 6.0.1.14, 6.1.x before 6.1.3.3, and 6.2.x before 6.2.1.1 do not verify a server's identity in a JMS session or an HTTP session, which allows local users to obtain root access to arbitrary agents via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
