Unspecified vulnerability in the NetBeans component in Oracle Fusion Middleware 8.1 allows local users to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors. NOTE: the previous information is from the October 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that this issue is a directory traversal vulnerability which allows local users with certain permissions to write to arbitrary files and consequently gain privileges via a ..
