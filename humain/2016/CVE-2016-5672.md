# CVE-2016-5672

- Published: 2016-08-01T02:59:00

Intel Crosswalk before 19.49.514.5, 20.x before 20.50.533.11, 21.x before 21.51.546.0, and 22.x before 22.51.549.0 interprets a user's acceptance of one invalid X.509 certificate to mean that all invalid X.509 certificates should be accepted without prompting, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
