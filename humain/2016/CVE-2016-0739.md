# CVE-2016-0739

- Published: 2016-04-13T17:59:00

- Modified: 2017-12-09T02:29:00

libssh before 0.7.3 improperly truncates ephemeral secrets generated for the (1) diffie-hellman-group1 and (2) diffie-hellman-group14 key exchange methods to 128 bits, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to decrypt or intercept SSH sessions via unspecified vectors, aka a "bits/bytes confusion bug."

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
