# CVE-2016-2126

- Published: 2017-05-11T14:29:00

- Modified: 2022-08-29T20:02:00

Samba version 4.0.0 up to 4.5.2 is vulnerable to privilege elevation due to incorrect handling of the PAC (Privilege Attribute Certificate) checksum. A remote, authenticated, attacker can cause the winbindd process to crash using a legitimate Kerberos ticket. A local service with access to the winbindd privileged pipe can cause winbindd to cache elevated access permissions.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
