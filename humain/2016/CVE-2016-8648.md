It was found that the Karaf container used by Red Hat JBoss Fuse 6.x, and Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.x, deserializes objects passed to MBeans via JMX operations. An attacker could use this flaw to execute remote code on the server as the user running the Java Virtual Machine if the target MBean contain deserialization gadgets in its classpath.
