# CVE-2016-6293

- Published: 2016-07-25T14:59:00

- Modified: 2019-04-23T19:29:00

The uloc_acceptLanguageFromHTTP function in common/uloc.cpp in International Components for Unicode (ICU) through 57.1 for C/C++ does not ensure that there is a '\0' character at the end of a certain temporary array, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a call with a long httpAcceptLanguage argument.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
