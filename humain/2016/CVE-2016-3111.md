pulp.spec in the installation process for Pulp 2.8.3 generates the RSA key pairs used to validate messages between the pulp server and pulp consumers in a directory that is world-readable before later modifying the permissions, which might allow local users to read the generated RSA keys via reading the key files while the installation process is running.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
