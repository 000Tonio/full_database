Radware devices use the same value for the first two GCM nonces, which allows remote attackers to obtain the authentication key and spoof data via a "forbidden attack," a similar issue to CVE-2016-0270.  NOTE: this issue may be due to the use of a third-party Cavium product.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
