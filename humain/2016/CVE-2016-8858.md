** DISPUTED ** The kex_input_kexinit function in kex.c in OpenSSH 6.x and 7.x through 7.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by sending many duplicate KEXINIT requests.  NOTE: a third party reports that "OpenSSH upstream does not consider this as a security issue."
