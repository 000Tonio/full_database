# CVE-2016-0049

- Published: 2016-02-10T11:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

Kerberos in Microsoft Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2, and Windows 10 Gold and 1511 does not properly validate password changes, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by deploying a crafted Key Distribution Center (KDC) and then performing a sign-in action, aka "Windows Kerberos Security Feature Bypass."

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
