# CVE-2016-10153

- Published: 2017-02-06T06:59:00

- Modified: 2017-02-09T14:57:00

The crypto scatterlist API in the Linux kernel 4.9.x before 4.9.6 interacts incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash or memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging reliance on earlier net/ceph/crypto.c code.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
