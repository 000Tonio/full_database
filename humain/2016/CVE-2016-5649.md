A vulnerability is in the 'BSW_cxttongr.htm' page of the Netgear DGN2200, version DGN2200-V1.0.0.50_7.0.50, and DGND3700, version DGND3700-V1.0.0.17_1.0.17, which can allow a remote attacker to access this page without any authentication. When processed, it exposes the admin password in clear text before it gets redirected to absw_vfysucc.cgia. An attacker can use this password to gain administrator access to the targeted router's web interface.
