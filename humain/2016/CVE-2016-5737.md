# CVE-2016-5737

- Published: 2017-01-12T23:59:00

- Modified: 2017-01-18T19:48:00

The Gerrit configuration in the Openstack Puppet module for Gerrit (aka puppet-gerrit) improperly marks text/html as a safe mimetype, which might allow remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a crafted review.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
