# CVE-2016-3100

- Published: 2016-07-13T15:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

kinit in KDE Frameworks before 5.23.0 uses weak permissions (644) for /tmp/xauth-xxx-_y, which allows local users to obtain X11 cookies of other users and consequently capture keystrokes and possibly gain privileges by reading the file.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
