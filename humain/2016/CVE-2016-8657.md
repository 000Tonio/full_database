# CVE-2016-8657

- Published: 2018-07-31T19:29:00

- Modified: 2023-02-12T23:26:00

It was discovered that EAP packages in certain versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux use incorrect permissions for /etc/sysconfig/jbossas configuration files. The file is writable to jboss group (root:jboss, 664). On systems using classic /etc/init.d init scripts (i.e. on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and earlier), the file is sourced by the jboss init script and its content executed with root privileges when jboss service is started, stopped, or restarted.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
