# CVE-2016-0734

- Published: 2016-04-07T19:59:00

- Modified: 2019-03-27T20:29:00

The web-based administration console in Apache ActiveMQ 5.x before 5.13.2 does not send an X-Frame-Options HTTP header, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct clickjacking attacks via a crafted web page that contains a (1) FRAME or (2) IFRAME element.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
