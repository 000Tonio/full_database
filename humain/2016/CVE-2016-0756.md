- Published: 2016-01-29T20:59:00

- Modified: 2016-12-06T03:05:00

The generate_dialback function in the mod_dialback module in Prosody before 0.9.10 does not properly separate fields when generating dialback keys, which allows remote attackers to spoof XMPP network domains via a crafted stream id and domain name that is included in the target domain as a suffix.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |
