# CVE-2016-9793

- Published: 2016-12-28T07:59:00

- Modified: 2023-01-17T21:05:00

The sock_setsockopt function in net/core/sock.c in the Linux kernel before 4.8.14 mishandles negative values of sk_sndbuf and sk_rcvbuf, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability for a crafted setsockopt system call with the (1) SO_SNDBUFFORCE or (2) SO_RCVBUFFORCE option.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
