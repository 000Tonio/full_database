Juniper Junos OS before 13.2X51-D40, 14.x before 14.1X53-D30, and 15.x before 15.1X53-D20 on QFX5100 and QFX10002 switches do not have sufficient entropy, which makes it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic encryption and authentication protection mechanisms via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
