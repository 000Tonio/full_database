Juniper Junos OS before 12.1X46-D50 on SRX Series devices reverts to "safe mode" authentication and allows root CLI logins without a password after a failed upgrade to 12.1X46, which might allow local users to gain privileges by leveraging use of the "request system software" command with the "partition" option.

### CVSS Score: **6.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
