# CVE-2016-10208

- Published: 2017-02-06T06:59:00

- Modified: 2018-08-24T10:29:00

The ext4_fill_super function in fs/ext4/super.c in the Linux kernel through 4.9.8 does not properly validate meta block groups, which allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and system crash) via a crafted ext4 image.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
