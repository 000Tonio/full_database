ManageEngine Applications Manager 12 and 13 before build 13200, allows unserialization of unsafe Java objects. The vulnerability can be exploited by remote user without authentication and it allows to execute remote code compromising the application as well as the operating system. As Application Manager's RMI registry is running with privileges of system administrator, by exploiting this vulnerability an attacker gains highest privileges on the underlying operating system.
