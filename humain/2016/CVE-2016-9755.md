The netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel before 4.9 mishandles IPv6 reassembly, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (integer overflow, out-of-bounds write, and GPF) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted application that makes socket, connect, and writev system calls, related to net/ipv6/netfilter/nf_conntrack_reasm.c and net/ipv6/netfilter/nf_defrag_ipv6_hooks.c.
