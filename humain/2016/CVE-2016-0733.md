The Admin UI in Apache Ranger before 0.5.1 does not properly handle authentication requests that lack a password, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by leveraging knowledge of a valid username.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
