# CVE-2016-5349

- Published: 2017-04-06T19:59:00

The high level operating systems (HLOS) was not providing sufficient memory address information to ensure that secure applications inside Qualcomm Secure Execution Environment (QSEE) only write to legitimate memory ranges related to the QSEE secure application's HLOS client. When secure applications inside Qualcomm Secure Execution Environment (QSEE) receive memory addresses from a high level operating system (HLOS) such as Linux Android, those address have previously been verified as belonging to HLOS memory space rather than QSEE memory space, but they were not verified to be from HLOS user space rather than kernel space. This lack of verification could lead to privilege escalation within the HLOS.
