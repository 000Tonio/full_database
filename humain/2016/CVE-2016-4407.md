The DSA algorithm implementation in SAP SAPCRYPTOLIB 5.555.38 does not properly check signatures, which allows remote authenticated users to impersonate arbitrary users via unspecified vectors, aka SAP Security Note 2223008.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
