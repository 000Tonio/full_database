The system.temporary route in Drupal 8.x before 8.1.10 does not properly check for "Export configuration" permission, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions and read a full config export via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
