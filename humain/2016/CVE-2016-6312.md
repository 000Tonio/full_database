The mod_dontdothat component of the mod_dav_svn Apache module in Subversion as packaged in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.11 does not properly detect recursion during entity expansion, which allows remote authenticated users with access to the webdav repository to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and httpd crash). NOTE: Exists as a regression to CVE-2009-1955.
