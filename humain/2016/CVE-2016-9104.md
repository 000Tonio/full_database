Multiple integer overflows in the (1) v9fs_xattr_read and (2) v9fs_xattr_write functions in hw/9pfs/9p.c in QEMU (aka Quick Emulator) allow local guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (QEMU process crash) via a crafted offset, which triggers an out-of-bounds access.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| --- | --- | --- |
