** DISPUTED ** Citrix XenMobile Server before 10.5.0.24 allows man-in-the-middle attackers to trigger HTTP 302 redirections via vectors involving the HTTP Host header and a cached page.  NOTE: the vendor reports "our internal analysis of this issue concluded that this was not a valid vulnerability" because an exploitation scenario would involve a man-in-the-middle attack against a TLS session.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
