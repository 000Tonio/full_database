NDSD in Novell eDirectory before 9.0.2 did not calculate ACLs on LDAP objects across partition boundaries correctly, which could lead to a privilege escalation by modifying user attributes that would otherwise be filtered by an ACL.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
