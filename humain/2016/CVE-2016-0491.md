Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Application Testing Suite component in Oracle Enterprise Manager Grid Control 12.4.0.2 and 12.5.0.2 allows remote attackers to affect integrity and availability via unknown vectors related to Load Testing for Web Apps.  NOTE: the previous information is from the January 2016 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that the UploadFileAction servlet allows remote authenticated users to upload and execute arbitrary files via an * (asterisk) character in the fileType parameter.
