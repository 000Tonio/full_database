WebKit/Source/core/layout/LayoutBlock.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 49.0.2623.75, does not properly determine when anonymous block wrappers may exist, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect cast and assertion failure) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JavaScript code.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**
