- Published: 2017-02-06T06:59:00

- Modified: 2017-02-09T21:55:00

The smbhash function in fs/cifs/smbencrypt.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x before 4.9.1 interacts incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash or memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of more than one virtual page for a scatterlist.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
