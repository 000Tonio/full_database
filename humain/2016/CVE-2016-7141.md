- Published: 2016-10-03T21:59:00

- Modified: 2018-11-13T11:29:00

curl and libcurl before 7.50.2, when built with NSS and the libnsspem.so library is available at runtime, allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of a TLS connection by leveraging reuse of a previously loaded client certificate from file for a connection for which no certificate has been set, a different vulnerability than CVE-2016-5420.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
