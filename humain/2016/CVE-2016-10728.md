# CVE-2016-10728

- Published: 2018-07-23T20:29:00

- Modified: 2018-09-20T13:33:00

An issue was discovered in Suricata before 3.1.2. If an ICMPv4 error packet is received as the first packet on a flow in the to_client direction, it confuses the rule grouping lookup logic. The toclient inspection will then continue with the wrong rule group. This can lead to missed detection.

### CVSS Score: **5**
