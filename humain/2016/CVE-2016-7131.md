# CVE-2016-7131

- Published: 2016-09-12T01:59:00

- Modified: 2020-11-16T19:41:00

ext/wddx/wddx.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before 7.0.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a malformed wddxPacket XML document that is mishandled in a wddx_deserialize call, as demonstrated by a tag that lacks a < (less than) character.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
