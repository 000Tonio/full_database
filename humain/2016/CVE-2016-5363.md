The IPTables firewall in OpenStack Neutron before 7.0.4 and 8.0.0 through 8.1.0 allows remote attackers to bypass an intended MAC-spoofing protection mechanism and consequently cause a denial of service or intercept network traffic via (1) a crafted DHCP discovery message or (2) crafted non-IP traffic.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
