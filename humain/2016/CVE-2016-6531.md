** DISPUTED ** Open Dental 16.1 and earlier has a hardcoded MySQL root password, which allows remote attackers to obtain administrative access by leveraging access to intranet TCP port 3306.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating that the "vulnerability note ... is factually false ... there is indeed a default blank password, but it can be changed ... We recommend that users change it, each customer receives direction."
