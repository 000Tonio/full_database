# CVE-2016-7914

- Published: 2016-11-16T05:59:00

- Modified: 2018-01-05T02:31:00

The assoc_array_insert_into_terminal_node function in lib/assoc_array.c in the Linux kernel before 4.5.3 does not check whether a slot is a leaf, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory or cause a denial of service (invalid pointer dereference and out-of-bounds read) via an application that uses associative-array data structures, as demonstrated by the keyutils test suite.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
