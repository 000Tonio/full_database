The x86 emulator in Xen does not properly treat x86 NULL segments as unusable when accessing memory, which might allow local HVM guest users to gain privileges via vectors involving "unexpected" base/limit values.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
