Microsoft Windows 8.1, Windows RT 8.1, and Windows 10 Gold, 1511, and 1607 do not properly check NTLM SSO requests for MSA logins, which makes it easier for remote attackers to determine passwords via a brute-force attack on NTLM password hashes, aka "Microsoft Information Disclosure Vulnerability."

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
