# CVE-2016-9920

- Published: 2016-12-08T18:59:00

- Modified: 2017-07-01T01:30:00

steps/mail/sendmail.inc in Roundcube before 1.1.7 and 1.2.x before 1.2.3, when no SMTP server is configured and the sendmail program is enabled, does not properly restrict the use of custom envelope-from addresses on the sendmail command line, which allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via a modified HTTP request that sends a crafted e-mail message.

### CVSS Score: **6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
