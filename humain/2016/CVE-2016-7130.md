# CVE-2016-7130

- Published: 2016-09-12T01:59:00

- Modified: 2018-01-05T02:31:00

The php_wddx_pop_element function in ext/wddx/wddx.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before 7.0.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via an invalid base64 binary value, as demonstrated by a wddx_deserialize call that mishandles a binary element in a wddxPacket XML document.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
