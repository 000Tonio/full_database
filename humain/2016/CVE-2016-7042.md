# CVE-2016-7042

- Published: 2016-10-16T21:59:00

- Modified: 2018-01-05T02:31:00

The proc_keys_show function in security/keys/proc.c in the Linux kernel through 4.8.2, when the GNU Compiler Collection (gcc) stack protector is enabled, uses an incorrect buffer size for certain timeout data, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack memory corruption and panic) by reading the /proc/keys file.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
