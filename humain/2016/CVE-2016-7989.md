# CVE-2016-7989

- Published: 2016-10-31T10:59:00

On Samsung Galaxy S4 through S7 devices, a malformed OTA WAP PUSH SMS containing an OMACP message sent remotely triggers an unhandled ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in Samsung's implementation of the WifiServiceImpl class within wifi-service.jar. This causes the Android runtime to continually crash, rendering the device unusable until a factory reset is performed, a subset of SVE-2016-6542.
