# CVE-2016-7126

- Published: 2016-09-12T01:59:00

- Modified: 2020-11-16T19:43:00

The imagetruecolortopalette function in ext/gd/gd.c in PHP before 5.6.25 and 7.x before 7.0.10 does not properly validate the number of colors, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (select_colors allocation error and out-of-bounds write) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a large value in the third argument.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
