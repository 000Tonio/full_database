# CVE-2016-2193

- Published: 2016-04-11T15:59:00

- Modified: 2017-09-03T01:29:00

PostgreSQL before 9.5.x before 9.5.2 does not properly maintain row-security status in cached plans, which might allow attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging a session that performs queries as more than one role.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
