wiretap/nettrace_3gpp_32_423.c in the 3GPP TS 32.423 Trace file parser in Wireshark 2.0.x before 2.0.2 does not ensure that a '\0' character is present at the end of certain strings, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow and application crash) via a crafted file.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
