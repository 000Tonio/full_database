The Java Console in IBM Domino 8.5.x before 8.5.3 FP6 IF13 and 9.x before 9.0.1 FP6, when a certain unsupported configuration involving UNC share pathnames is used, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors, aka SPR KLYHA7MM3J.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-0920.
