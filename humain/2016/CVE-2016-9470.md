Revive Adserver before 3.2.5 and 4.0.0 suffers from Reflected File Download. `www/delivery/asyncspc.php` was vulnerable to the fairly new Reflected File Download (RFD) web attack vector that enables attackers to gain complete control over a victim's machine by virtually downloading a file from a trusted domain.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**
