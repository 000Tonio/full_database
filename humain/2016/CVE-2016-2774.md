ISC DHCP 4.1.x before 4.1-ESV-R13 and 4.2.x and 4.3.x before 4.3.4 does not restrict the number of concurrent TCP sessions, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (INSIST assertion failure or request-processing outage) by establishing many sessions.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
