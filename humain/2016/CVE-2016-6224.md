- Published: 2016-07-22T14:59:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:33:00

ecryptfs-setup-swap in eCryptfs does not prevent the unencrypted swap partition from activating during boot when using GPT partitioning on a (1) NVMe or (2) MMC drive, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-8946.
