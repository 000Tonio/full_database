# CVE-2023-22651

Improper Privilege Management vulnerability in SUSE Rancher allows Privilege Escalation. A failure in the update logic of Rancher's admission Webhook may lead to
 the misconfiguration of the Webhook. This component enforces validation
 rules and security checks before resources are admitted into the 
Kubernetes cluster.
The issue only affects users that upgrade from 2.6.x or 2.7.x to 2.7.2. Users that did a fresh install of 2.7.2 (and did not follow an upgrade path) are not affected.
