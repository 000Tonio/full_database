nophp is a PHP web framework. Prior to version 0.0.1, nophp is vulnerable to shell command injection on httpd user. A patch was made available at commit e5409aa2d441789cbb35f6b119bef97ecc3986aa on 2023-03-30. Users should update index.php to 2023-03-30 or later or, as a workaround, add a function such as `env_patchsample230330.php` to env.php.
