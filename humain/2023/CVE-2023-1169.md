# CVE-2023-1169

- Published: 2023-06-09T06:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-09T13:03:00

The OoohBoi Steroids for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to missing authorization due to a missing capability check on the 'file_uploader_callback' function in versions up to, and including, 2.1.4. This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers to upload image attachments to the site.
