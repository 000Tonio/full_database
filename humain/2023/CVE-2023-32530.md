Vulnerable modules of Trend Micro Apex Central (on-premise) contain vulnerabilities which would allow authenticated users to perform a SQL injection that could lead to remote code execution.

Please note: an attacker must first obtain authentication on the target system in order to exploit these vulnerabilities.

This is similar to, but not identical to CVE-2023-32529.
