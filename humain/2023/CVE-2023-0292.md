# CVE-2023-0292

- Published: 2023-06-09T06:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-09T13:03:00

The Quiz And Survey Master plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 8.0.8. This is due to missing nonce validation on the function associated with the qsm_remove_file_fd_question AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary media files via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
