A vulnerability in Cisco Industrial Network Director could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of content submitted to the affected application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending requests containing malicious values to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
