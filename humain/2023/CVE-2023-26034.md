ZoneMinder is a free, open source Closed-circuit television software application for Linux which supports IP, USB and Analog cameras. Versions prior to 1.36.33 and 1.37.33 are affected by a SQL Injection vulnerability. The (blind) SQL Injection vulnerability is present within the `filter[Query][terms][0][attr]` query string parameter of the `/zm/index.php` endpoint. A user with the View or Edit permissions of Events may execute arbitrary SQL. The resulting impact can include unauthorized data access (and modification), authentication and/or authorization bypass, and remote code execution.
