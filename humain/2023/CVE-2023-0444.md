A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Delta Electronics InfraSuite Device Master 00.00.02a. A default user 'User', which is in the 'Read Only User' group, can view the password of another default user 'Administrator', which is in the 'Administrator' group. This allows any lower privileged user to log in as an administrator.
