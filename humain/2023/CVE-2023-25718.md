# CVE-2023-25718

The cryptographic code signing process and controls on ConnectWise Control through 22.9.10032 (formerly known as ScreenConnect) are cryptographically flawed. An attacker can remotely generate or locally alter file contents and bypass code-signing controls. This can be used to execute code as a trusted application provider, escalate privileges, or execute arbitrary commands in the context of the user. The attacker tampers with a trusted, signed executable in transit.
