# CVE-2023-1393

- Published: 2023-03-30T21:15:00

- Modified: 2023-05-30T06:16:00

A flaw was found in X.Org Server Overlay Window. A Use-After-Free may lead to local privilege escalation. If a client explicitly destroys the compositor overlay window (aka COW), the Xserver would leave a dangling pointer to that window in the CompScreen structure, which will trigger a use-after-free later.
