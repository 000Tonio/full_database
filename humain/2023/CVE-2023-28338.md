Any request send to a Netgear Nighthawk Wifi6 Router (RAX30)'s web service containing a “Content-Type” of “multipartboundary=” will result in the request body being written to “/tmp/mulipartFile” on the device itself. A sufficiently large file will cause device resources to be exhausted, resulting in the device becoming unusable until it is rebooted.
