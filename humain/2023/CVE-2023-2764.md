# CVE-2023-2764

- Published: 2023-06-09T06:16:00

- Modified: 2023-06-09T13:03:00

The Draw Attention plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the ajax_set_featured_image function in versions up to, and including, 2.0.11. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to change the featured image of arbitrary posts with an image that exists in the media library.

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
