# CVE-2023-28433

- Published: 2023-03-22T21:15:00

Minio is a Multi-Cloud Object Storage framework. All users on Windows prior to version RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z are impacted. MinIO fails to filter the `\` character, which allows for arbitrary object placement across buckets. As a result, a user with low privileges, such as an access key, service account, or STS credential, which only has permission to `PutObject` in a specific bucket, can create an admin user. This issue is patched in RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z. There are no known workarounds.
