# CVE-2023-2304

- Published: 2023-05-31T05:15:00

- Modified: 2023-05-31T13:02:00

The Favorites plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'user_favorites' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 2.3.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
