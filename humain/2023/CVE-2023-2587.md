Teltonikaâ€™s Remote Management System versions prior to 4.10.0 contain a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the main page of the web interface. An attacker with the MAC address and serial number of a connected device could send a maliciously crafted JSON file with an HTML object to trigger the vulnerability. This could allow the attacker to execute scripts in the account context and obtain remote code execution on managed devices.
