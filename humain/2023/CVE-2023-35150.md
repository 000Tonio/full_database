XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Starting in version 2.40m-2 and prior to versions 14.4.8, 14.10.4, and 15.0, any user with view rights on any document can execute code with programming rights, leading to remote code execution by crafting an url with a dangerous payload. The problem has been patched in XWiki 15.0, 14.10.4 and 14.4.8.
