SAP Plant Connectivity - version 15.5 (PCo) or the Production Connector for SAP Digital Manufacturing - version 1.0, do not validate the signature of the JSON Web Token (JWT) in the HTTP request sent from SAP Digital Manufacturing. Therefore, unauthorized callers from the internal network could send service requests to PCo or the Production Connector, which could have an impact on the integrity of the integration with SAP Digital Manufacturing.
