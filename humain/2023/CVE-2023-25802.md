Roxy-WI is a Web interface for managing Haproxy, Nginx, Apache, and Keepalived servers. Versions prior to 6.3.6.0 don't correctly neutralize `dir/../filename` sequences, such as `/etc/nginx/../passwd`, allowing an actor to gain information about a server. Version 6.3.6.0 has a patch for this issue.
