The Announcement & Notification Banner â€“ Bulletin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to a missing nonce validation on the 'bulletinwp_update_bulletin_status', 'bulletinwp_update_bulletin', 'bulletinwp_update_settings', 'bulletinwp_update_status', 'bulletinwp_export_bulletins', and 'bulletinwp_import_bulletins' functions in versions up to, and including, 3.7.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings, modify bulletins, create new bulletins, and more, via a forged request granted they can trick a site's user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
