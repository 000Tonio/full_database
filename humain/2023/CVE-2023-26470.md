XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. It's possible to make the farm unusable by adding an object to a page with a huge number (e.g. 67108863). Most of the time this will fill the memory allocated to XWiki and make it unusable every time this document is manipulated. This issue has been patched in XWiki 14.0-rc-1.
