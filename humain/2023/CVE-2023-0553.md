# CVE-2023-0553

- Published: 2023-01-27T21:15:00

- Modified: 2023-02-07T19:12:00

The Quick Restaurant Menu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via its settings parameters in versions up to, and including, 2.0.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

### CVSS Score: **null**
