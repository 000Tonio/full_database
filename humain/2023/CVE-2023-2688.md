The WordPress File Upload and WordPress File Upload Pro plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to Path Traversal in versions up to, and including, 4.19.1 via the vulnerable parameter wfu_newpath. This allows administrator-level attackers to move files uploaded with the plugin (located in wp-content/uploads by default) outside of the web root.
