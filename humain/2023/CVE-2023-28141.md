An NTFS Junction condition exists in the Qualys Cloud Agent
for Windows platform in versions before 4.8.0.31. Attackers may write files to
arbitrary locations via a local attack vector. This allows attackers to assume
the privileges of the process, and they may delete or otherwise on unauthorized
files, allowing for the potential modification or deletion of sensitive files
limited only to that specific directory/file object. This vulnerability is
bounded only to the time of uninstallation and can only be exploited locally.



At the time of this disclosure, versions before 4.0 are
classified as End of Life.
