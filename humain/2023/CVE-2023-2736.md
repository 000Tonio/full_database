# CVE-2023-2736

- Published: 2023-05-20T03:15:00

- Modified: 2023-05-20T03:15:00

The Groundhogg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.7.9.8. This is due to missing nonce validation in the 'ajax_edit_contact' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to receive the auto login link via shortcode and then modify the assigned user to the auto login link to elevate verified user privileges via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
