The Elementor Addons, Widgets and Enhancements â€“ Stax plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.4.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the toggle_widget function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to enable or disable Elementor widgets via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
