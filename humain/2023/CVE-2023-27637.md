An issue was discovered in the tshirtecommerce (aka Custom Product Designer) component 2.1.4 for PrestaShop. An HTTP request can be forged with a compromised product_id GET parameter in order to exploit an insecure parameter in the front controller file designer.php, which could lead to a SQL injection. This is exploited in the wild in March 2023.
