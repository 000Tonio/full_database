GLPI is a free asset and IT management software package. Starting in version 10.0.0 and prior to version 10.0.7, GLPI inventory endpoint can be used to drive a SQL injection attack. It can also be used to store malicious code that could be used to perform XSS attack. By default, GLPI inventory endpoint requires no authentication. Version 10.0.7 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, disable native inventory.
