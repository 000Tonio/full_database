# CVE-2023-3051

The Page Builder by AZEXO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via 'azh_post' shortcode in versions up to, and including, 1.27.133 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for contributor-level attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
