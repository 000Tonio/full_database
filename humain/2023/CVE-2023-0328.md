# CVE-2023-0328

- Published: 2023-03-06T14:15:00

- Modified: 2023-03-06T14:23:00

The WPCode WordPress plugin before 2.0.7 does not have adequate privilege checks in place for several AJAX actions, only checking the nonce. This may lead to allowing any authenticated user who can edit posts to call the endpoints related to WPCode Library authentication (such as update and delete the auth key).

### CVSS Score: **null**
