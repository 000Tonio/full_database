In SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence (Web Intelligence user interface) - version 430, some calls return json with wrong content type in the header of the response. As a result, a custom application that calls directly the jsp of Web Intelligence DHTML may be vulnerable to XSS attacks. On successful exploitation an attacker can cause a low impact on integrity of the application.
