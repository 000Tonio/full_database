Missing HTTP headers (X-Frame-Options, Content-Security-Policy) in KNIME
 Business Hub before 1.4.0 has left users vulnerable to click 
jacking. Clickjacking is an attack that occurs when an attacker uses a 
transparent iframe in a window to trick a user into clicking on an 
actionable item, such as a button or link, to another server in which 
they have an identical webpage. The attacker essentially hijacks the 
user activity intended for the original server and sends them to the 
other server.
