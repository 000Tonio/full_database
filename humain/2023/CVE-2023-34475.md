A heap use after free issue was discovered in ImageMagick's ReplaceXmpValue() function in MagickCore/profile.c. An attacker could trick user to open a specially crafted file to convert, triggering an heap-use-after-free write error, allowing an application to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
