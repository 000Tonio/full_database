The BT21 x BTS Wallpaper app 12 for Android allows unauthorized apps to actively request permission to modify data in the database that records information about a user's personal preferences and will be loaded into memory to be read and used when the app is opened. An attacker could tamper with this data to cause an escalation of privilege attack.
