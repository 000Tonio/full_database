# CVE-2023-35926

Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. The Backstage scaffolder-backend plugin uses a templating library that requires sandbox, as it by design allows for code injection. The library used for this sandbox so far has been `vm2`, but in light of several past vulnerabilities and existing vulnerabilities  that may not have a fix, the plugin has switched to using a different sandbox library. A malicious actor with write access to a registered scaffolder template could manipulate the template in a way that allows for remote code execution on the scaffolder-backend instance. This was only exploitable in the template YAML definition itself and not by user input data. This is vulnerability is fixed in version 1.15.0 of `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`.
