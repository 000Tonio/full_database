# CVE-2023-1403

- Published: 2023-06-09T06:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-09T06:15:00

The Weaver Xtreme Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping of the profile display name in versions up to, and including, 5.0.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

### CVSS Score: **null**
