# CVE-2023-2547

- Published: 2023-05-31T03:15:00

- Modified: 2023-05-31T13:02:00

The Feather Login Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check on the 'deleteUser' function in versions starting from 1.0.7 up to, and including, 1.1.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to delete the temp user generated by the plugin.

### CVSS Score: **null**
