The permission system implemented and enforced by the GarminOS TVM component in CIQ API version 1.0.0 through 4.1.7 can be bypassed entirely. A malicious application with specially crafted code and data sections could access restricted CIQ modules, call their functions and disclose sensitive data such as user profile information and GPS coordinates, among others.
