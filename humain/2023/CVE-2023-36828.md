Statamic is a flat-first, Laravel and Git powered content management system. Prior to version 4.10.0, the SVG tag does not sanitize malicious SVG. Therefore, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform cross-site scripting attacks using SVG, even when using the `sanitize` function. Version 4.10.0 contains a patch for this issue.
