# CVE-2023-3390

- Published: 2023-06-28T21:15:00

- Modified: 2023-07-06T21:32:00

A use-after-free vulnerability was found in the Linux kernel's netfilter subsystem in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c.

Mishandled error handling with NFT_MSG_NEWRULE makes it possible to use a dangling pointer in the same transaction causing a use-after-free vulnerability. This flaw allows a local attacker with user access to cause a privilege escalation issue.

We recommend upgrading past commitÂ 1240eb93f0616b21c675416516ff3d74798fdc97.
