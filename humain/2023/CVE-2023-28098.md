# CVE-2023-28098

OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation. Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4, a specially crafted Authorization header causes OpenSIPS to crash or behave in an unexpected way due to a bug in the function `parse_param_name()` . This issue was discovered while performing coverage guided fuzzing of the function parse_msg. The AddressSanitizer identified that the issue occurred in the function `q_memchr()` which is being called by the function `parse_param_name()`. This issue may cause erratic program behaviour or a server crash. It affects configurations containing functions that make use of the affected code, such as the function `www_authorize()` . Versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4 contain a fix.
