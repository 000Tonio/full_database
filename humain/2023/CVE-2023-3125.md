The B2BKing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'b2bking_save_price_import' function in versions up to, and including, 4.6.00. This makes it possible for Authenticated attackers with subscriber or customer-level permissions to modify the pricing of any product on the site.
