# CVE-2023-1387

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. 

Starting with the 9.1 branch, Grafana introduced the ability to search for a JWT in the URL query parameter auth_token and use it as the authentication token. 

By enabling the "url_login" configuration option (disabled by default), a JWT might be sent to data sources. If an attacker has access to the data source, the leaked token could be used to authenticate to Grafana.
