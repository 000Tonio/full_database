RIOT-OS, an operating system for Internet of Things (IoT) devices, contains a network stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames. Prior to version 2023.04, an attacker can send a crafted frame to the device to trigger a NULL pointer dereference leading to denial of service. This issue is fixed in version 2023.04. There are no known workarounds.
