# CVE-2023-2496

- Published: 2023-05-24T00:15:00

- Modified: 2023-05-24T12:59:00

The Go Pricing - WordPress Responsive Pricing Tables plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized arbitrary file uploads due to an improper capability check on the 'validate_upload' function in versions up to, and including, 3.3.19. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with a role that the administrator previously granted access to the plugin to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.

### CVSS Score: **null**
