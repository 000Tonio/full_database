The WPCS â€“ WordPress Currency Switcher Professional plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the save function in versions up to, and including, 1.1.9. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to edit an arbitrary custom drop-down currency switcher.
