# CVE-2023-27855

- Published: 2023-03-22T00:15:00

In affected versions, a path traversal exists when processing a message in Rockwell Automation's ThinManager ThinServer. An unauthenticated remote attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to upload arbitrary files to any directory on the disk drive where ThinServer.exe is installed. The attacker could overwrite existing executable files with attacker-controlled, malicious contents, potentially causing remote code execution.
