NOSH 4a5cfdb allows stored XSS via the create user page. For example, a first name (of a physician, assistant, or billing user) can have a JavaScript payload that is executed upon visiting the /users/2/1 page. This may allow attackers to steal Protected Health Information because the product is for health charting.
