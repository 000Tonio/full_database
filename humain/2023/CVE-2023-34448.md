# CVE-2023-34448

Grav is a flat-file content management system. Prior to version 1.7.42, the patch for CVE-2022-2073, a server-side template injection vulnerability in Grav leveraging the default `filter()` function, did not block other built-in functions exposed by Twig's Core Extension that could be used to invoke arbitrary unsafe functions, thereby allowing for remote code execution. A patch in version 1.74.2 overrides the built-in Twig `map()` and `reduce()` filter functions in `system/src/Grav/Common/Twig/Extension/GravExtension.php` to validate the argument passed to the filter in `$arrow`.
