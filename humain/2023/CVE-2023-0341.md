A stack buffer overflow exists in the ec_glob function of editorconfig-core-c before v0.12.6 which allowed an attacker to arbitrarily write to the stack and possibly allows remote code execution. editorconfig-core-c v0.12.6 resolved this vulnerability by bound checking all write operations over the p_pcre buffer.
