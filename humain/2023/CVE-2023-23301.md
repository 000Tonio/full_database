The `news` MonkeyC operation code in CIQ API version 1.0.0 through 4.1.7 fails to check that string resources are not extending past the end of the expected sections. A malicious CIQ application could craft a string that starts near the end of a section, and whose length extends past its end. Upon loading the string, the GarminOS TVM component may read out-of-bounds memory.
