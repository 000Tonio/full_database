# CVE-2023-0446

- Published: 2023-01-23T17:15:00

- Modified: 2023-02-01T14:04:00

The My YouTube Channel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via its settings parameters in versions up to, and including, 3.0.12.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

### CVSS Score: **null**
