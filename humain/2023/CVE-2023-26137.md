All versions of the package drogonframework/drogon are vulnerable to HTTP Response Splitting when untrusted user input is used to build header values in the addHeader and addCookie functions. An attacker can add the \r\n (carriage return line feeds) characters to end the HTTP response headers and inject malicious content.
