BlueCat Device Registration Portal 2.2 allows XXE attacks that exfiltrate single-line files. A single-line file might contain credentials, such as "machine example.com login daniel password qwerty" in the documentation example for the .netrc file format. NOTE: 2.x versions are no longer supported. There is no available information about whether any later version is affected.
