In Eternal Terminal 6.2.1, TelemetryService uses fixed paths in /tmp. For example, a local attacker can create /tmp/.sentry-native-etserver with mode 0777 before the etserver process is started. The attacker can choose to read sensitive information from that file, or modify the information in that file.
