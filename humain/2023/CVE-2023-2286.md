# CVE-2023-2286

- Published: 2023-06-09T13:15:00

The WP Activity Log for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.5.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_run_cleanup function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to invoke this function via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
