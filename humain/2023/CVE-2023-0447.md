# CVE-2023-0447

- Published: 2023-01-23T17:15:00

- Modified: 2023-02-01T14:05:00

The My YouTube Channel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the clear_all_cache function in versions up to, and including, 3.0.12.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to clear the plugin's cache.

### CVSS Score: **null**
