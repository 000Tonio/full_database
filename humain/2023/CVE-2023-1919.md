# CVE-2023-1919

- Published: 2023-04-06T20:15:00

- Modified: 2023-04-07T15:15:00

The WP Fastest Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the wpfc_preload_single_save_settings_callback function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change cache-related settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
