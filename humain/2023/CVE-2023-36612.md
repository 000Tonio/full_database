Directory traversal can occur in the Basecamp com.basecamp.bc3 application before 4.2.1 for Android, which may allow an attacker to write arbitrary files in the application's private directory. Additionally, by using a malicious intent, the attacker may redirect the server's responses (containing sensitive information) to third-party applications by using a custom-crafted deeplink scheme.
