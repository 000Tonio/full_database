# CVE-2023-1341

- Published: 2023-03-10T20:15:00

The RapidLoad Power-Up for Autoptimize plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.7.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_deactivate function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to turn off caching via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
