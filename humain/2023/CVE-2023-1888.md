# CVE-2023-1888

- Published: 2023-06-09T06:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-09T06:15:00

The Directorist plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to an arbitrary user password reset in versions up to, and including, 7.5.4. This is due to a lack of validation checks within login.php. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to reset the password of an arbitrary user and gain elevated (e.g., administrator) privileges.

### CVSS Score: **null**
