# CVE-2023-3124

- Published: 2023-06-07T02:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-07T02:44:00

The Elementor Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized data modification due to a missing capability check on the update_page_option function in versions up to, and including, 3.11.6. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level capabilities to update arbitrary site options, which can lead to privilege escalation.

### CVSS Score: **null**
