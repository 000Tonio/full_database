# CVE-2023-26476

- Published: 2023-03-02T19:15:00

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 3.2-m3, users can deduce the content of the password fields by repeated call to `LiveTableResults` and `WikisLiveTableResultsMacros`. The issue can be fixed by upgrading to versions 14.7-rc-1, 13.4.4, or 13.10.9 and higher, or in version >= 3.2M3 by applying the patch manually on `LiveTableResults` and `WikisLiveTableResultsMacros`.
