# CVE-2023-3320

- Published: 2023-06-20T03:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-21T18:15:00

The WP Sticky Social  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing nonce validation in the ~/admin/views/admin.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
