# CVE-2023-23846

- Published: 2023-02-01T03:15:00

Due to insufficient length validation in the Open5GS GTP library versions prior to versions 2.4.13 and 2.5.7, when parsing extension headers in GPRS tunneling protocol (GPTv1-U) messages, a protocol payload with any extension header length set to zero causes an infinite loop. The affected process becomes immediately unresponsive, resulting in denial of service and excessive resource consumption. CVSS3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C
