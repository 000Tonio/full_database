# CVE-2023-28448

Versionize is a framework for version tolerant serializion/deserialization of Rust data structures, designed for usecases that need fast deserialization times and minimal size overhead. An issue was discovered in the ‘Versionize::deserialize’ implementation provided by the ‘versionize’ crate for ‘vmm_sys_utils::fam::FamStructWrapper', which can lead to out of bounds memory accesses. The impact started with version 0.1.1. The issue was corrected in version 0.1.10 by inserting a check that verifies, for any deserialized header, the lengths of compared flexible arrays are equal and aborting deserialization otherwise.
