# CVE-2023-2599

- Published: 2023-06-09T06:16:00

The Active Directory Integration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery leading to time-based SQL Injection via the orderby and order parameters in versions up to, and including, 4.1.4 due to missing nonce verification on the get_users function and insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query.  This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used to cause resource exhaustion via a forged request granted they can trick an administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
