The WP Activity Log Premium plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the ajax_switch_db function in versions up to, and including, 4.5.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level or higher to make changes to the plugin's settings.
