CairoSVG is an SVG converter based on Cairo, a 2D graphics library. Prior to version 2.7.0, Cairo can send requests to external hosts when processing SVG files. A malicious actor could send a specially crafted SVG file that allows them to perform a server-side request forgery or denial of service. Version 2.7.0 disables CairoSVG's ability to access other files online by default.
