The KiviCare WordPress plugin before 3.2.1 does not have CSRF checks (either flawed or missing completely) in various AJAX actions, which could allow attackers to make logged in users perform unwanted actions via CSRF attacks. This includes, but is not limited to: Delete arbitrary appointments/medical records/etc, create/update various users (patients, doctors etc)
