# CVE-2023-3022

- Published: 2023-06-19T18:15:00

A flaw was found in the IPv6 module of the Linux kernel. The arg.result was not used consistently in fib6_rule_lookup, sometimes holding rt6_info and other times fib6_info. This was not accounted for in other parts of the code where rt6_info was expected unconditionally, potentially leading to a kernel panic in fib6_rule_suppress.
