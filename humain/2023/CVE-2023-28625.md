# CVE-2023-28625

mod_auth_openidc is an authentication and authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements the OpenID Connect Relying Party functionality. In versions 2.0.0 through 2.4.13.1, when `OIDCStripCookies` is set and a crafted cookie supplied, a NULL pointer dereference would occur, resulting in a segmentation fault. This could be used in a Denial-of-Service attack and thus presents an availability risk. Version 2.4.13.2 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, avoid using `OIDCStripCookies`.
