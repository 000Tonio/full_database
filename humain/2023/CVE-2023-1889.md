# CVE-2023-1889

- Published: 2023-06-09T06:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-09T13:03:00

The Directorist plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to an Insecure Direct Object Reference in versions up to, and including, 7.5.4. This is due to improper validation and authorization checks within the listing_task function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to delete arbitrary posts.

### CVSS Score: **null**
