A vulnerability has been identified in Rocket.Chat, where the ACL checks in the Slash Command /mute occur after checking whether a user is a member of a given channel, leaking private channel members to unauthorized users. This allows authenticated users to enumerate whether a username is a member of a channel that they do not have access to.

### CVSS Score: **null**
