Redpanda before 22.3.12 discloses cleartext AWS credentials. The import functionality in the rpk binary logs an AWS Access Key ID and Secret in cleartext to standard output, allowing a local user to view the key in the console, or in Kubernetes logs if stdout output is collected. The fixed versions are 22.3.12, 22.2.10, and 22.1.12.
