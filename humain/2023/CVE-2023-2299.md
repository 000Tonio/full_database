The Online Booking & Scheduling Calendar for WordPress by vcita plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized medication of data via the /wp-json/vcita-wordpress/v1/actions/auth REST-API endpoint in versions up to, and including, 4.2.10 due to a missing capability check on the processAction function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers modify the plugin's settings.
