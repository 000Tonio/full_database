A vulnerability in the Connect Mobility Router component of Mitel MiVoice Connect versions 9.6.2208.101 and earlier could allow an unauthenticated attacker with internal network access to authenticate with administrative privileges, because the initial installation does not enforce a password change. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to make arbitrary configuration changes and execute arbitrary commands.
