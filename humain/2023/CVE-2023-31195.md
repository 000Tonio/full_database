ASUS Router RT-AX3000 Firmware versions prior to 3.0.0.4.388.23403 uses sensitive cookies without 'Secure' attribute. When an attacker is in a position to be able to mount a man-in-the-middle attack, and a user is tricked to log into the affected device through an unencrypted ('http') connection, the user's session may be hijacked.
