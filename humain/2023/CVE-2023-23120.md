The use of the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) algorithm for integrity check during firmware update makes TRENDnet TV-IP651WI Network Camera firmware version v1.07.01 and earlier vulnerable to firmware modification attacks. An attacker can conduct a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to modify the new firmware image and bypass the checksum verification.
