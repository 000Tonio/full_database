# CVE-2023-3201

- Published: 2023-06-14T02:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-14T03:37:00

The MStore API plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to missing nonce validation on the mstore_update_new_order_title function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update new order title via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
