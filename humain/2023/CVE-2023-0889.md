Themeflection Numbers WordPress plugin before 2.0.1 does not have authorisation and CSRF check in an AJAX action, and does not ensure that the options to be updated belong to the plugin. As a result, it could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber, to update arbitrary blog options, such as enabling registration and set the default role to administrator

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
