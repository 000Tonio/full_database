# CVE-2023-1075

- Published: 2023-03-27T21:15:00

- Modified: 2023-03-27T21:15:00

A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. The tls_is_tx_ready() incorrectly checks for list emptiness, potentially accessing a type confused entry to the list_head, leaking the last byte of the confused field that overlaps with rec->tx_ready.
