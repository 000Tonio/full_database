# CVE-2023-2706

The OTP Login Woocommerce & Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass. This is due to the fact that when generating OTP codes for users to use in order to login via phone number, the plugin returns these codes in an AJAX response. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain login codes for administrators. This does require an attacker have access to the phone number configured for an account, which can be obtained via social engineering or reconnaissance.
