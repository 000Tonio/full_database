# CVE-2023-0711

- Published: 2023-02-08T02:15:00

- Modified: 2023-02-10T02:25:00

The Wicked Folders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the ajax_save_state function in versions up to, and including, 2.18.16. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to invoke this function and perform actions intended for administrators such as modifying the view state of the folder structure maintained by the plugin.

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
