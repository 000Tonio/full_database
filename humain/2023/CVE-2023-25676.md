TensorFlow is an open source machine learning platform. When running versions prior to 2.12.0 and 2.11.1 with XLA, `tf.raw_ops.ParallelConcat` segfaults with a nullptr dereference when given a parameter `shape` with rank that is not greater than zero. A fix is available in TensorFlow 2.12.0 and 2.11.1.
