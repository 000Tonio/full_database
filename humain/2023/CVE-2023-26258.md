Arcserve UDP through 9.0.6034 allows authentication bypass. The method getVersionInfo at WebServiceImpl/services/FlashServiceImpl leaks the AuthUUID token. This token can be used at /WebServiceImpl/services/VirtualStandbyServiceImpl to obtain a valid session. This session can be used to execute any task as administrator.

### CVSS Score: **null**
