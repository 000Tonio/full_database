# CVE-2023-0558

- Published: 2023-01-27T22:15:00

The ContentStudio plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to an unsecure token check that is susceptible to type juggling in versions up to, and including, 1.2.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to execute functions intended for use by users with proper API keys.
