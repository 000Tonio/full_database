An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the kernel of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). If the receipt of router advertisements is enabled on an interface and a specifically malformed RA packet is received, memory corruption will happen which leads to an rpd crash. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S5; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S4; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved 20.3-EVO version 20.3R1-EVO and later versions; 20.4-EVO versions prior to 20.4R3-S6-EVO; 21.3-EVO versions prior to 21.3R3-EVO; 21.4-EVO versions prior to 21.4R2-EVO; 22.1-EVO versions prior to 22.1R2-EVO.
