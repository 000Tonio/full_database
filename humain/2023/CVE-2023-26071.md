An issue was discovered in MCUBO ICT through 10.12.4 (aka 6.0.2). An Observable Response Discrepancy can occur under the login web page. In particular, the web application provides different responses to incoming requests in a way that reveals internal state information to an unauthorized actor. That allow an unauthorized actor to perform User Enumeration attacks.
