Plaintext storage of a password exists in CONPROSYS HMI System (CHS) versions prior to 3.5.3. Because account information of the database is saved in a local file in plaintext, a user who can access the PC where the affected product is installed can obtain the information. As a result, information in the database may be obtained and/or altered by the user.
