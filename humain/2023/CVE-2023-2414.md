# CVE-2023-2414

- Published: 2023-06-09T06:16:00

- Modified: 2023-06-09T13:03:00

The Online Booking & Scheduling Calendar for WordPress by vcita plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the vcita_save_settings_callback function in versions up to, and including, 4.2.10. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to modify the plugins settings, upload media files, and inject malicious JavaScript.

### CVSS Score: **null**
