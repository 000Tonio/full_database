# CVE-2023-0219

- Published: 2023-03-13T17:15:00

The FluentSMTP WordPress plugin before 2.2.3 does not sanitize or escape email content, making it vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting attacks (XSS) when an administrator views the email logs. This exploit requires other plugins to enable users to send emails with unfiltered HTML.
