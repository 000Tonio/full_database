Array Networks Array AG Series and vxAG (9.4.0.481 and earlier) allow remote code execution. An attacker can browse the filesystem on the SSL VPN gateway using a flags attribute in an HTTP header without authentication. The product could then be exploited through a vulnerable URL. The 2023-03-09 vendor advisory stated "a new Array AG release with the fix will be available soon."
