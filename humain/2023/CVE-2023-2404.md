# CVE-2023-2404

- Published: 2023-06-03T05:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-03T05:15:00

The CRM and Lead Management by vcita plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'email' parameter in versions up to, and including, 2.6.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with the edit_posts capability, such as contributors and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
