# CVE-2023-2546

- Published: 2023-06-06T02:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-07T20:15:00

The WP User Switch plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 1.0.2. This is due to incorrect authentication checking in the 'wpus_allow_user_to_admin_bar_menu' function with the 'wpus_who_switch' cookie value. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the username.

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
