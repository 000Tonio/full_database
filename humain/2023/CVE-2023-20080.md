A vulnerability in the IPv6 DHCP version 6 (DHCPv6) relay and server features of Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of data boundaries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted DHCPv6 messages to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload unexpectedly.
