The Service Location Protocol (SLP, RFC 2608) allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to register arbitrary services. This could allow the attacker to use spoofed UDP traffic to conduct a denial-of-service attack with a significant amplification factor.

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
