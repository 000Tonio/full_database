# CVE-2023-28154

- Published: 2023-03-13T01:15:00

- Modified: 2023-04-22T03:15:00

Webpack 5 before 5.76.0 does not avoid cross-realm object access. ImportParserPlugin.js mishandles the magic comment feature. An attacker who controls a property of an untrusted object can obtain access to the real global object.
