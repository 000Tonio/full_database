The ownCloud Android app allows ownCloud users to access, share, and edit files and folders. Version 2.21.1 of the ownCloud Android app is vulnerable to SQL injection in `FileContentProvider.kt`. This issue can lead to information disclosure. Two databases, `filelist` and `owncloud_database`, are affected. In version 3.0, the `filelist` database was deprecated. However, injections affecting `owncloud_database` remain relevant as of version 3.0.
