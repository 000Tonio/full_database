Kanboard is project management software that focuses on the Kanban methodology. In versions prior to 1.2.31authenticated user is able to perform a SQL Injection, leading to a privilege escalation or loss of confidentiality. It appears that in some insert and update operations, the code improperly uses the PicoDB library to update/insert new information. Version 1.2.31 contains a fix for this issue.
