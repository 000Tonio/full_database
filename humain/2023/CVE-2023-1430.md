The FluentCRM - Marketing Automation For WordPress  plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data in versions up to, and including, 2.7.40 due to the use of an MD5 hash without a salt to control subscriptions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to unsubscribe users from lists and manage subscriptions, granted they gain access to any targeted subscribers email address.

### CVSS Score: **null**
