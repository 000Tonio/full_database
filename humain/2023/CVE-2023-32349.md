Version 00.07.03.4 and prior of Teltonikaâ€™s RUT router firmware contain a packet dump utility that contains proper validation for filter parameters. However, variables for validation checks are stored in an external configuration file. An authenticated attacker could use an exposed UCI configuration utility to change these variables and enable malicious parameters in the dump utility, which could result in arbitrary code execution.
