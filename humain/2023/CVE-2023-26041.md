Nextcloud Talk is a fully on-premises audio/video and chat communication service. When cron jobs were misconfigured and therefore messages are not expired, the API would still return them while they were then hidden by the frontend code. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Talk is upgraded to 15.0.3. There are no workaround available.
