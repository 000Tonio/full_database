# CVE-2023-1829

- Published: 2023-04-12T12:15:00

A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel traffic control index filter (tcindex) can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The tcindex_delete function which does not properly deactivate filters in case of a perfect hashes while deleting the underlying structure which can later lead to double freeing the structure. A local attacker user can use this vulnerability to elevate its privileges to root.
We recommend upgrading past commit 8c710f75256bb3cf05ac7b1672c82b92c43f3d28.
