A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC IPC1047 (All versions), SIMATIC IPC1047E (All versions with maxView Storage Manager < 4.09.00.25611 on Windows), SIMATIC IPC647D (All versions), SIMATIC IPC647E (All versions with maxView Storage Manager < 4.09.00.25611 on Windows), SIMATIC IPC847D (All versions), SIMATIC IPC847E (All versions with maxView Storage Manager < 4.09.00.25611 on Windows). The Adaptec Maxview application on affected devices is using a non-unique TLS certificate across installations to protect the communication from the local browser to the local application.
A local attacker may use this key to decrypt intercepted local traffic between the browser and the application and could perform a man-in-the-middle attack in order to modify data in transit.
