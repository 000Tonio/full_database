# CVE-2023-2261

- Published: 2023-06-09T13:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-09T18:33:00

The WP Activity Log plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the handle_ajax_call function in versions up to, and including, 4.5.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access or higher, to obtain a list of users with accounts on the site. This includes ids, usernames and emails.

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
