In SAP AS NetWeaver JAVA - versions SERVERCORE 7.50, J2EE-FRMW 7.50, CORE-TOOLS 7.50, an unauthenticated attacker can attach to an open interface and make use of an open naming and directory API to instantiate an object which has methods which can be called without further authorization and authentication. Â A subsequent call to one of these methods can read or change the state of existing services without any effect on availability.
