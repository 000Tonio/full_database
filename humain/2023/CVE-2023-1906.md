A heap-based buffer overflow issue was discovered in ImageMagick's ImportMultiSpectralQuantum() function in MagickCore/quantum-import.c. An attacker could pass specially crafted file to convert, triggering an out-of-bounds read error, allowing an application to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
