The `Toybox.Ant.BurstPayload.add` API method in CIQ API version 2.2.0 through 4.1.7 suffers from a type confusion vulnreability, which can result in an out-of-bounds write operation. A malicious application could create a specially crafted `Toybox.Ant.BurstPayload` object, call its `add` method, override arbitrary memory and hijack the execution of the device's firmware.
