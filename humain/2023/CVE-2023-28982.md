A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the routing protocol daemon of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated, network based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). In a BGP rib sharding scenario, when an attribute of an active BGP route is updated memory will leak. As rpd memory usage increases over time the rpd process will eventually run out of memory, crash, and restart. The memory utilization can be monitored with the following CLI commands: show task memory show system processes extensive | match rpd This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S2; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S6; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved 20.3-EVO version 20.3R1-EVO and later versions; 20.4-EVO versions prior to 20.4R3-S6-EVO; 21.2-EVO versions prior to 21.2R3-EVO; 21.3-EVO versions prior to 21.3R2-EVO.
