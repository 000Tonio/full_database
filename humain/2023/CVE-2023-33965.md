Brook is a cross-platform programmable network tool. The `tproxy` server is vulnerable to a drive-by command injection. An attacker may fool a victim into visiting a malicious web page which will trigger requests to the local `tproxy` service leading to remote code execution. A patch is available in version 20230606.
