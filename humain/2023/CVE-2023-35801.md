A directory traversal vulnerability in Safe Software FME Server before 2022.2.5 allows an attacker to bypass validation when editing a network-based resource connection, resulting in the unauthorized reading and writing of arbitrary files. Successful exploitation requires an attacker to have access to a user account with write privileges. FME Flow 2023.0 is also a fixed version.
