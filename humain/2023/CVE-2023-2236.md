# CVE-2023-2236

- Published: 2023-05-01T13:15:00

- Modified: 2023-05-01T13:38:00

A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel io_uring subsystem can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.

Both io_install_fixed_file and its callers call fput in a file in case of an error, causing a reference underflow which leads to a use-after-free vulnerability.

We recommend upgrading past commit 9d94c04c0db024922e886c9fd429659f22f48ea4.
