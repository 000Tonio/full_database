# CVE-2023-1868

- Published: 2023-04-05T14:15:00

- Modified: 2023-04-05T17:35:00

The YourChannel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized loss of data due to a missing capability check when clearing the plugin cache via the yrc_clear_cache GET parameter in versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to clear the plugin's cache.
