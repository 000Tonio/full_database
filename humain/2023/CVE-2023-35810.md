An issue was discovered in SugarCRM Enterprise before 11.0.6 and 12.x before 12.0.3. A Second-Order PHP Object Injection vulnerability has been identified in the DocuSign module. By using crafted requests, custom PHP code can be injected and executed through the DocuSign module because of missing input validation. Admin user privileges are required to exploit this vulnerability. Editions other than Enterprise are also affected.
