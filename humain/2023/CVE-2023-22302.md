In BIG-IP versions 17.0.x before 17.0.0.2, and 16.1.x beginning in 16.1.2.2 to before 16.1.3.3, when an HTTP profile is configured on a virtual server and conditions beyond the attackerâ€™s control exist on the target pool member, undisclosed requests sent to the BIG-IP system can cause the Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) to terminate. Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.
