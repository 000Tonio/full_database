An issue was discovered in Nokia NetAct before 22 SP1037. On the Site Configuration Tool tab, attackers can upload a ZIP file which, when processed, exploits Stored XSS. The upload option of the Site Configuration tool does not validate the file contents. The application is in a demilitarised zone behind a perimeter firewall and without exposure to the internet. The attack can only be performed by an internal user.
