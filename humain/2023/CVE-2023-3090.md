A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux Kernel ipvlan network driver can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.

The out-of-bounds write is caused by missing skb->cb  initialization in the ipvlan network driver. The vulnerability is reachable ifÂ CONFIG_IPVLAN is enabled.


We recommend upgrading past commit 90cbed5247439a966b645b34eb0a2e037836ea8e.
