# CVE-2023-2833

- Published: 2023-06-06T10:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-06T12:50:00

The ReviewX plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in versions up to, and including, 1.6.13 due to insufficient restriction on the 'rx_set_screen_options' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a subscriber, to modify their user role by supplying the 'wp_screen_options[option]' and 'wp_screen_options[value]' parameters during a screen option update.

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| undefined | undefined | undefined |
