In affected versions, a heap-based buffer over-read condition occurs when the message field indicates more data than is present in the message field in Rockwell Automation's ThinManager ThinServer. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability to crash ThinServer.exe due to a read access violation.
