# CVE-2023-36464

- Published: 2023-06-27T22:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-28T12:34:00

pypdf is an open source, pure-python PDF library. In affected versions an attacker may craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop if `__parse_content_stream` is executed. That is, for example, the case if the user extracted text from such a PDF. This issue was introduced in pull request #969 and resolved in pull request #1828. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may modify the line `while peek not in (b"\r", b"\n")` in `pypdf/generic/_data_structures.py` to `while peek not in (b"\r", b"\n", b"")`.
