# CVE-2023-32523

Affected versions of Trend Micro Mobile Security (Enterprise) 9.8 SP5 contain some widgets that would allow a remote user to bypass authentication and potentially chain with other vulnerabilities.

Please note: an attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit these vulnerabilities.

This is similar to, but not identical to CVE-2023-32524.
