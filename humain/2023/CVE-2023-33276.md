# CVE-2023-33276

The web interface of Gira Giersiepen Gira KNX/IP-Router 3.1.3683.0 and 3.3.8.0 responds with a "404 - Not Found" status code if a path is accessed that does not exist. However, the value of the path is reflected in the response. As the application will reflect the supplied path without context-sensitive HTML encoding, it is vulnerable to reflective cross-site scripting (XSS).
