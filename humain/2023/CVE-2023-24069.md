** DISPUTED ** Signal Desktop before 6.2.0 on Windows, Linux, and macOS allows an attacker to obtain potentially sensitive attachments sent in messages from the attachments.noindex directory. Cached attachments are not effectively cleared. In some cases, even after a self-initiated file deletion, an attacker can still recover the file if it was previously replied to in a conversation. (Local filesystem access is needed by the attacker.) NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of this finding because the product is not intended to protect against adversaries with this degree of local access.
