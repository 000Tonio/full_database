In Splunk Enterprise versions below 8.1.13, 8.2.10, and 9.0.4, the lookup table upload feature let a user upload lookup tables with unnecessary filename extensions. Lookup table file extensions may now be one of the following only: .csv, .csv.gz, .kmz, .kml, .mmdb, or .mmdb.gzl. For more information on lookup table files, see [About lookups](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Knowledge/Aboutlookupsandfieldactions).
