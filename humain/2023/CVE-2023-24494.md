A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in Tenable.sc due to improper validation of user-supplied input before returning it to users. An authenticated, remote attacker can exploit this by convincing a user to click a specially crafted URL, to execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser session.

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
