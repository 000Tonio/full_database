# CVE-2023-23119

- Published: 2023-02-02T17:17:00

The use of the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) algorithm for integrity check during firmware update makes Ubiquiti airFiber AF2X Radio firmware version 3.2.2 and earlier vulnerable to firmware modification attacks. An attacker can conduct a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack to modify the new firmware image and bypass the checksum verification.
