A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user-supplied data. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by entering crafted text into various input fields within the web-based management interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform a stored XSS attack, which could allow the execution of scripts within the context of other users of the interface.
