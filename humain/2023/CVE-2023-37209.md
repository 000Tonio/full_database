A use-after-free condition existed in `NotifyOnHistoryReload` where a `LoadingSessionHistoryEntry` object was freed and a reference to that object remained.  This resulted in a potentially exploitable condition when the reference to that object was later reused. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 115.
