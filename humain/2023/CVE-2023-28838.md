GLPI is a free asset and IT management software package. Starting in version 0.50 and prior to versions 9.5.13 and 10.0.7, a SQL Injection vulnerability allow users with access rights to statistics or reports to extract all data from database and, in some cases, write a webshell on the server. Versions 9.5.13 and 10.0.7 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, remove `Assistance > Statistics` and `Tools > Reports` read rights from every user.
