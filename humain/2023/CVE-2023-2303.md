# CVE-2023-2303

- Published: 2023-06-03T05:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-03T05:15:00

The Contact Form and Calls To Action by vcita plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.6.4. This is due to missing nonce validation in the vcita-callback.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
