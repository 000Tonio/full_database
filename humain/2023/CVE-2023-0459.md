# CVE-2023-0459

- Published: 2023-05-25T14:15:00

- Modified: 2023-05-25T15:58:00

Copy_from_user on 64-bit versions of the Linux kernel does not implement the __uaccess_begin_nospec allowing a user to bypass the "access_ok" check and pass a kernel pointer to copy_from_user(). This would allow an attacker to leak information. We recommend upgrading beyond commitÂ 74e19ef0ff8061ef55957c3abd71614ef0f42f47
