# CVE-2023-2170

- Published: 2023-04-19T10:15:00

- Modified: 2023-04-19T12:39:00

The TaxoPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Related Posts functionality in versions up to, and including, 3.6.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with Editor+ permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
