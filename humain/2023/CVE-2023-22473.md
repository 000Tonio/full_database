Talk-Android enables users to have video & audio calls through Nextcloud on Android. Due to passcode bypass, an attacker is able to access the user's Nextcloud files and view conversations. To exploit this the attacker needs to have physical access to the target's device. There are currently no known workarounds available. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Talk Android app is upgraded to 15.0.2.
