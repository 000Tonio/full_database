# CVE-2023-1872

- Published: 2023-04-12T16:15:00

- Modified: 2023-04-12T16:19:00

A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel io_uring system can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation.

The io_file_get_fixed function lacks the presence of ctx->uring_lock which can lead to a Use-After-Free vulnerability due a race condition with fixed files getting unregistered.

We recommend upgrading past commit da24142b1ef9fd5d36b76e36bab328a5b27523e8.
