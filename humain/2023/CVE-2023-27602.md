In Apache Linkis <=1.3.1, The PublicService module uploads files without restrictions on the path to the uploaded files, and file types.


We recommend users upgrade the version of Linkis to version 1.3.2. 

For versions 

<=1.3.1, we suggest turning on the file path check switch in linkis.properties

`wds.linkis.workspace.filesystem.owner.check=true`
`wds.linkis.workspace.filesystem.path.check=true`
