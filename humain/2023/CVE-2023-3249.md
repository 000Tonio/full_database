# CVE-2023-3249

The Web3 â€“ Crypto wallet Login & NFT token gating plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including, 2.6.0. This is due to incorrect authentication checking in the 'hidden_form_data' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if they have access to the username.

### CVSS Score: **null**
