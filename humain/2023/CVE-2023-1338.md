The RapidLoad Power-Up for Autoptimize plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized cache modification due to a missing capability check on the attach_rule function in versions up to, and including, 1.7.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access to modify cache rules.
