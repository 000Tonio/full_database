The B2BKing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the 'b2bkingdownloadpricelist' function in versions up to, and including, 4.6.00. This makes it possible for Authenticated attackers with subscriber or customer-level permissions to retrieve the full pricing list of all products on the site.
