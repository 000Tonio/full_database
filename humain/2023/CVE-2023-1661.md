# CVE-2023-1661

The Display post meta, term meta, comment meta, and user meta plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via post metadata in versions up to, and including, 0.4.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
