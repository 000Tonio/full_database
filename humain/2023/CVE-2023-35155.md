XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services for applications built on top of it. Users are able to forge an URL with a payload allowing to inject Javascript in the page (XSS). For instance, the following URL execute an `alter` on the browser: `<xwiki-host>/xwiki/bin/view/Main/?viewer=share&send=1&target=&target=%3Cimg+src+onerror%3Dalert%28document.domain%29%3E+%3Cimg+src+onerror%3Dalert%28document.domain%29%3E+%3Crenniepak%40intigriti.me%3E&includeDocument=inline&message=I+wanted+to+share+this+page+with+you.`, where `<xwiki-host>` is the URL of your XWiki installation. The vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 15.0-rc-1, 14.10.4, and 14.4.8.
