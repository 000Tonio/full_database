A website could have obscured the fullscreen notification by using a combination of <code>window.open</code>, fullscreen requests, <code>window.name</code> assignments, and <code>setInterval</code> calls. This could have led to user confusion and possible spoofing attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 112, Focus for Android < 112, Firefox ESR < 102.10, Firefox for Android < 112, and Thunderbird < 102.10.
