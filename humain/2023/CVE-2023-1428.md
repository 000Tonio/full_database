# CVE-2023-1428

- Published: 2023-06-09T11:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-09T13:03:00

There exists an vulnerability causing an abort() to be called in gRPC. 
The following headers cause gRPC's C++ implementation to abort() when called via http2:

te: x (x != trailers)

:scheme: x (x != http, https)

grpclb_client_stats: x (x == anything)

On top of sending one of those headers, a later header must be sent that gets the total header size past 8KB. We recommend upgrading past git commit 2485fa94bd8a723e5c977d55a3ce10b301b437f8 or v1.53 and above.
