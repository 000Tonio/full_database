In Docker Desktop 4.17.x the Artifactory Integration falls back to sending registry credentials over plain HTTP if the HTTPS health check has failed. A targeted network sniffing attack can lead to a disclosure of sensitive information. Only users who have Access Experimental Features enabled and have logged in to a private registry are affected.
