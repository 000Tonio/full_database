A vulnerability in Cisco Duo Two-Factor Authentication for macOS could allow an authenticated, physical attacker to bypass secondary authentication and access an affected macOS device. This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of responses from Cisco Duo when the application is configured to fail open. An attacker with primary user credentials could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to authenticate to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the affected device without valid permission.
