Talend Data Catalog remote harvesting server before 8.0-20230413 contains a /upgrade endpoint that allows an unauthenticated WAR file to be deployed on the server. (A mitigation is that the remote harvesting server should be behind a firewall that only allows access to the Talend Data Catalog server.)

### CVSS Score: **null**
