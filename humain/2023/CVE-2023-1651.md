The AI ChatBot WordPress plugin before 4.4.9 does not have authorisation and CSRF in the AJAX action responsible to update the OpenAI settings, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscriber to update them. Furthermore, due to the lack of escaping of the settings, this could also lead to Stored XSS
