Meldekarten generator is an open source project to create a program, running locally in the browser without the need for an internet-connection, to create, store and print registration cards for volunteers. All text fields on the webpage are vulnerable to XSS attacks. The user input isn't (fully) sanitized after submission. This issue has been addressed in commit `77e04f4af` which is included in the `1.0.0b1.1.2` release. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
