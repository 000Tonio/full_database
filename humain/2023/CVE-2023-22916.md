The configuration parser of Zyxel ATP series firmware versions 5.10 through 5.35, USG FLEX series firmware versions 5.00 through 5.35, USG FLEX 50(W) firmware versions 5.10 through 5.35, USG20(W)-VPN firmware versions 5.10 through 5.35, and VPN series firmware versions 5.00 through 5.35, which fails to properly sanitize user input. A remote unauthenticated attacker could leverage the vulnerability to modify device configuration data, resulting in DoS conditions on an affected device if the attacker could trick an authorized administrator to switch the management mode to the cloud mode.
