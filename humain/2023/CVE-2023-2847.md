During internal security analysis, a local privilege escalation vulnerability has been identified. On a machine with the affected ESET product installed, it was possible for a user with lower privileges due to improper privilege management to trigger actions with root privileges.

ESET remedied this possible attack vector and has prepared new builds of its products that are no longer susceptible to this vulnerability.
