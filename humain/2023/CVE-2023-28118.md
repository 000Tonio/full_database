kaml provides YAML support for kotlinx.serialization. Prior to version 0.53.0, applications that use kaml to parse untrusted input containing anchors and aliases may consume excessive memory and crash. Version 0.53.0 and later default to refusing to parse YAML documents containing anchors and aliases. There are no known workarounds.
