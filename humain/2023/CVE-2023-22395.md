A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the kernel of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). In an MPLS scenario specific packets destined to an Integrated Routing and Bridging (irb) interface of the device will cause a buffer (mbuf) to leak. Continued receipt of these specific packets will eventually cause a loss of connectivity to and from the device, and requires a reboot to recover. These mbufs can be monitored by using the CLI command 'show system buffers': user@host> show system buffers 783/1497/2280 mbufs in use (current/cache/total) user@host> show system buffers 793/1487/2280 mbufs in use (current/cache/total) <<<<<< mbuf usage increased This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: All versions prior to 19.3R3-S7; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S9; 20.1 version 20.1R1 and later versions; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S5; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S5; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S4; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S2; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S1; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R3; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2.
