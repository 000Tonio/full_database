# CVE-2023-1095

- Published: 2023-02-28T23:15:00

In nf_tables_updtable, if nf_tables_table_enable returns an error, nft_trans_destroy is called to free the transaction object. nft_trans_destroy() calls list_del(), but the transaction was never placed on a list -- the list head is all zeroes, this results in a NULL pointer dereference.
