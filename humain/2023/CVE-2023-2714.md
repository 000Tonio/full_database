# CVE-2023-2714

- Published: 2023-05-20T03:15:00

- Modified: 2023-05-20T03:15:00

The Groundhogg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the 'check_license' functions in versions up to, and including, 2.7.9.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to change the license key and support license key, but it can only be changed to a valid license key.

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
