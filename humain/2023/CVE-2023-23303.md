# CVE-2023-23303

- Published: 2023-05-23T20:15:00

- Modified: 2023-05-23T20:48:00

The `Toybox.Ant.GenericChannel.enableEncryption` API method in CIQ API version 3.2.0 through 4.1.7 does not validate its parameter, which can result in buffer overflows when copying various attributes. A malicious application could call the API method with specially crafted object and hijack the execution of the device's firmware.
