Sourcecodester Enrollment System Project V1.0 is vulnerable to SQL Injection (SQLI) attacks, which allow an attacker to manipulate the SQL queries executed by the application. The application fails to properly validate user-supplied input in the username and password fields during the login process, enabling an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
