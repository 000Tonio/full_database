The WP Dark Mode WordPress plugin before 4.0.8 does not properly sanitize the style parameter in shortcodes before using it to load a PHP template. This leads to Local File Inclusion on servers where non-existent directories may be traversed, or when chained with another vulnerability allowing arbitrary directory creation.
