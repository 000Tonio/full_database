# CVE-2023-2836

- Published: 2023-05-31T04:15:00

The CRM Perks Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via form settings in versions up to, and including, 1.1.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.
