# CVE-2023-0253

The Real Media Library: Media Library Folder & File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via folder names in versions up to, and including, 4.18.28 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with author-level permissions and above to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
