# CVE-2023-1930

- Published: 2023-04-06T21:15:00

- Modified: 2023-04-07T15:15:00

The WP Fastest Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized data deletion due to a missing capability check on the wpfc_clear_cache_of_allsites_callback function in versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access to delete caches.

### CVSS Score: **null**
