# CVE-2023-2066

The Announcement & Notification Banner â€“ Bulletin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access and modification of data due to a missing capability check on the  'bulletinwp_update_bulletin_status', 'bulletinwp_update_bulletin', 'bulletinwp_update_settings', 'bulletinwp_update_status', 'bulletinwp_export_bulletins', and 'bulletinwp_import_bulletins' functions functions in versions up to, and including, 3.6.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-level access, and above, to modify the plugin's settings, modify bulletins, create new bulletins, and more.
