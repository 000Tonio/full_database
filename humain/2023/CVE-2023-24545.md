# CVE-2023-24545

- Published: 2023-04-12T21:15:00

- Modified: 2023-04-13T02:51:00

On affected platforms running Arista CloudEOS an issue in the Software Forwarding Engine (Sfe) can lead to a potential denial of service attack by sending malformed packets to the switch. This causes a leak of packet buffers and if enough malformed packets are received, the switch may eventually stop forwarding traffic.
