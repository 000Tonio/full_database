# CVE-2023-1602

- Published: 2023-06-29T02:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-29T02:15:00

The Short URL plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'comment' parameter due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in versions up to, and including, 1.6.4. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
