The VK Blocks plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to improper authorization via the REST 'update_options' function in versions up to, and including, 1.57.0.5. This allows authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions or above, to change the 'vk_font_awesome_version' option to an arbitrary value.

### CVSS Score: **null**
