# CVE-2023-23619

Modelina is a library for generating data models based on inputs such as AsyncAPI, OpenAPI, or JSON Schema documents. Versions prior to 1.0.0 are vulnerable to Code injection. This issue affects anyone who is using the default presets and/or does not handle the functionality themself. This issue has been partially mitigated in version 1.0.0, with the maintainer's GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA) noting "It is impossible to fully guard against this, because users have access to the original raw information. However, as of version 1, if you only access the constrained models, you will not encounter this issue. Further similar situations are NOT seen as a security issue, but intended behavior." The suggested workaround from the maintainers is "Fully custom presets that change the entire rendering process which can then escape the user input."
