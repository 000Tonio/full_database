Authentication Bypass in Hub Business integration in Devolutions Workspace Desktop 2023.1.1.3 and earlier on Windows and macOS allows an attacker with access to the user interface to unlock a Hub 
Business space without being prompted to enter the password via an 
unimplemented "Force Login" security feature.

This vulnerability occurs only if "Force Login" feature is enabled on the Hub Business instance and that an attacker has access to a locked Workspace desktop application configured with a Hub Business space.
