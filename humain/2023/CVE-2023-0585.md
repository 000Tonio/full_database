# CVE-2023-0585

- Published: 2023-02-24T15:15:00

- Modified: 2023-02-24T16:42:00

The All in One SEO Pack plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via multiple parameters in versions up to, and including, 4.2.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with Administrator role or above to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

### CVSS Score: **null**
