# CVE-2023-30450

- Published: 2023-04-08T23:15:00

- Modified: 2023-04-08T23:15:00

rpk in Redpanda before 23.1.2 mishandles the redpanda.rpc_server_tls field, leading to (for example) situations in which there is a data type mismatch that cannot be automatically fixed by rpk, and instead a user must reconfigure (while a cluster is turned off) in order to have TLS on broker RPC ports. NOTE: the fix was also backported to the 22.2 and 22.3 branches.
