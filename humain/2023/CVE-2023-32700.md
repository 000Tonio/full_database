# CVE-2023-32700

- Published: 2023-05-20T18:15:00

LuaTeX before 1.17.0 allows execution of arbitrary shell commands when compiling a TeX file obtained from an untrusted source. This occurs because luatex-core.lua lets the original io.popen be accessed. This also affects TeX Live before 2023 r66984 and MiKTeX before 23.5.
