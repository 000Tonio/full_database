# CVE-2023-3063

- Published: 2023-06-30T02:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-30T02:15:00

The SP Project & Document Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object References in versions up to, and including, 4.67. This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system resources. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber privileges or above, to change user passwords and potentially take over administrator accounts.

### CVSS Score: **null**
