Trend Micro Mobile Security (Enterprise) 9.8 SP5 contains vulnerable .php files that could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on affected installations.

Please note: an attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.

This is similar to, but not identical to CVE-2023-32528.
