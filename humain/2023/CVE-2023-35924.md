GLPI is a free asset and IT management software package. Starting in version 10.0.0 and prior to version 10.0.8, GLPI inventory endpoint can be used to drive a SQL injection attack. By default, GLPI inventory endpoint requires no authentication. Version 10.0.8 has a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may disable native inventory.
