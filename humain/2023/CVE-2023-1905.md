# CVE-2023-1905

The WP Popups WordPress plugin before 2.1.5.1 does not properly escape the href attribute of its spu-facebook-page shortcode before outputting it back in a page/post where the shortcode is embed, which could allow users with the contributor role and above to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting attacks. This is due to an insufficient fix of CVE-2023-24003
