# CVE-2023-0957

An issue was discovered in Gitpod versions prior to release-2022.11.2.16. There is a Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) vulnerability that allows attackers to make WebSocket connections to the Gitpod JSONRPC server using a victimâ€™s credentials, because the Origin header is not restricted. This can lead to the extraction of data from workspaces, to a full takeover of the workspace.
