# CVE-2023-24998

- Published: 2023-02-20T16:15:00

Apache Commons FileUpload before 1.5 does not limit the number of request parts to be processed resulting in the possibility of an attacker triggering a DoS with a malicious upload or series of uploads.




Note that, like all of the file upload limits, the
          new configuration option (FileUploadBase#setFileCountMax) is not
          enabled by default and must be explicitly configured.
