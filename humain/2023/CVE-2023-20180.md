A vulnerability in the web interface of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system.
 This vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web interface on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to click a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions. These actions could include joining meetings and scheduling training sessions.
