The management interface in the phion airlock Web Application Firewall (WAF) 4.1-10.41 does not properly handle CGI requests that specify large width and height parameters for an image, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands or cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via a crafted request.
