# CVE-2009-0935

- Published: 2009-03-18T02:00:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:30:00

The inotify_read function in the Linux kernel 2.6.27 to 2.6.27.13, 2.6.28 to 2.6.28.2, and 2.6.29-rc3 allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS) via a read with an invalid address to an inotify instance, which causes the device's event list mutex to be unlocked twice and prevents proper synchronization of a data structure for the inotify instance.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
