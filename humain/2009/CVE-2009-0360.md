Russ Allbery pam-krb5 before 3.13, when linked against MIT Kerberos, does not properly initialize the Kerberos libraries for setuid use, which allows local users to gain privileges by pointing an environment variable to a modified Kerberos configuration file, and then launching a PAM-based setuid application. Per vendor advisory:

"This advisory is only for my pam-krb5 module, as distributed from my web site and packaged by Debian, Ubuntu, and Gentoo."
