Apple Mac OS X 10.5 before 10.5.8 does not properly share file descriptors over local sockets, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) by placing file descriptors in messages sent to a socket that has no receiver, related to a "synchronization issue."

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| --- | --- | --- |
