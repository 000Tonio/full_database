- Published: 2009-09-18T22:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T19:43:00

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Google Chrome 2.x and 3.x before 3.0.195.21 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a (1) RSS or (2) Atom feed, related to the rendering of the application/rss+xml content type as XML "active content." Per http://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/archive/1/506517/100/0/threaded


VII. SOLUTION
-------------------------
Chrome: Upgrade to latest version of Google Chrome (v3.0.195.21 or higher).
If you remain connected to the internet, this should be automatic.
Opera: Wait for upcoming patch for Scenario (3) in next minor release
(non-alpha/beta) of Opera 10 [Opera 9 users need to upgrade]. However, you
will still continue to be vulnerable to script execution.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
