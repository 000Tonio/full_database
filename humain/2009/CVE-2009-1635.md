- Published: 2009-05-22T16:48:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T19:37:00

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the WebAccess component in Novell GroupWise 7.x before 7.03 HP3 and 8.x before 8.0 HP2 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the User.lang parameter to the login page (aka gw/webacc), (2) style expressions in a message that contains an HTML file, or (3) vectors associated with incorrect protection mechanisms against scripting, as demonstrated using whitespace between JavaScript event names and values.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
