The nsDocument::SetScriptGlobalObject function in content/base/src/nsDocument.cpp in Mozilla Firefox 3.5.x before 3.5.2, when certain add-ons are enabled, does not properly handle a Link HTTP header, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges via a crafted web page, related to an incorrect security wrapper.
