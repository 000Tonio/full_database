- Published: 2009-08-31T16:30:00

Opera 9.52 and earlier, and 10.00 Beta 3 Build 1699, does not properly block data: URIs in Location headers in HTTP responses, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related to (1) injecting a Location header that contains JavaScript sequences in a data:text/html URI or (2) entering a data:text/html URI with JavaScript sequences when specifying the content of a Location header.  NOTE: the JavaScript executes outside of the context of the HTTP site.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
