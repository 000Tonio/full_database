# CVE-2009-2688

- Published: 2009-08-05T19:30:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:30:00

Multiple integer overflows in glyphs-eimage.c in XEmacs 21.4.22, when running on Windows, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via (1) the tiff_instantiate function processing a crafted TIFF file, (2) the png_instantiate function processing a crafted PNG file, and (3) the jpeg_instantiate function processing a crafted JPEG file, all which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information.
