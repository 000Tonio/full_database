Microsoft Windows XP, Server 2003 and 2008, and Vista exposes I/O activity measurements of all processes, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information, as demonstrated by reading the I/O Other Bytes column in Task Manager (aka taskmgr.exe) to estimate the number of characters that a different user entered at a runas.exe password prompt, related to a "benchmarking attack."

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
