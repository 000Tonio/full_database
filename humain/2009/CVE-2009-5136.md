- Published: 2013-10-11T22:55:00

- Modified: 2021-07-15T19:15:00

The policy definition evaluator in Condor before 7.4.2 does not properly handle attributes in a WANT_SUSPEND policy that evaluate to an UNDEFINED state, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (condor_startd exit) via a crafted job.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
