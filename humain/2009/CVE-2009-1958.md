- Published: 2009-06-08T01:00:00

- Modified: 2009-10-14T05:24:00

charon/sa/tasks/child_create.c in the charon daemon in strongSWAN before 4.3.1 switches the NULL checks for TSi and TSr payloads, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via an IKE_AUTH request without a (1) TSi or (2) TSr traffic selector.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
