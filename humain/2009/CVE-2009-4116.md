Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in CutePHP CuteNews 1.4.6, when magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allow remote authenticated users with editor or administrative application access to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in the source parameter in a (1) list or (2) editnews action to the Editnews module, and (3) the save_con[skin] parameter in the Options module.  NOTE: vector 3 can be leveraged for code execution by using a .. to include and execute arbitrary local files.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
