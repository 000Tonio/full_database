# CVE-2009-4902

- Published: 2010-06-18T16:30:00

- Modified: 2010-08-12T14:22:00

Buffer overflow in the MSGFunctionDemarshall function in winscard_svc.c in the PC/SC Smart Card daemon (aka PCSCD) in MUSCLE PCSC-Lite 1.5.4 and earlier might allow local users to gain privileges via crafted SCARD_CONTROL message data, which is improperly demarshalled.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2010-0407.
