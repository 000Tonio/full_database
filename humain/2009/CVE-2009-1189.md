# CVE-2009-1189

- Published: 2009-04-27T18:00:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:19:00

The _dbus_validate_signature_with_reason function (dbus-marshal-validate.c) in D-Bus (aka DBus) before 1.2.14 uses incorrect logic to validate a basic type, which allows remote attackers to spoof a signature via a crafted key. NOTE: this is due to an incorrect fix for CVE-2008-3834.
