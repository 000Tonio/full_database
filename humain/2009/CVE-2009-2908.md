# CVE-2009-2908

- Published: 2009-10-13T10:30:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:20:00

The d_delete function in fs/ecryptfs/inode.c in eCryptfs in the Linux kernel 2.6.31 allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel OOPS) and possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors that cause a "negative dentry" and trigger a NULL pointer dereference, as demonstrated via a Mutt temporary directory in an eCryptfs mount.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
