- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:30:00

lib/pk-libgcrypt.c in libgnutls in GnuTLS before 2.6.6 does not properly handle invalid DSA signatures, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly have unspecified other impact via a malformed DSA key that triggers a (1) free of an uninitialized pointer or (2) double free.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
