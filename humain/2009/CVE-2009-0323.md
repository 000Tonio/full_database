# CVE-2009-0323

- Published: 2009-01-28T20:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T21:01:00

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in W3C Amaya Web Browser 10.0 and 11.0 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a long type parameter in an input tag, which is not properly handled by the EndOfXmlAttributeValue function; (2) an "HTML GI" in a start tag, which is not properly handled by the ProcessStartGI function; and unspecified vectors in (3) html2thot.c and (4) xml2thot.c, related to the msgBuffer variable.  NOTE: these are different vectors than CVE-2008-6005.

### CVSS Score: **10**
