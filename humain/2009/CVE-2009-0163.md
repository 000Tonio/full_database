# CVE-2009-0163

- Published: 2009-04-23T17:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T21:00:00

Integer overflow in the TIFF image decoding routines in CUPS 1.3.9 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF image, which is not properly handled by the (1) _cupsImageReadTIFF function in the imagetops filter and (2) imagetoraster filter, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
