# CVE-2009-3706

- Published: 2009-10-16T16:30:00

- Modified: 2009-10-16T16:30:00

Unspecified vulnerability in the ZFS filesystem in Sun Solaris 10, and OpenSolaris snv_100 through snv_117, allows local users to bypass intended limitations of the file_chown_self privilege via certain uses of the chown system call. Per:  http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-66-265908-1

1. Impact

A security vulnerability in the ZFS file system in OpenSolaris and Solaris 10 systems with patches 137137-09 (SPARC) or 137138-09 (x86) installed may allow a local unprivileged user with the 'file_chown_self' privilege to take ownership of files belonging to another user. Per:  http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-66-265908-1

"Notes:

1. Solaris 8 and 9 are not impacted by this issue.

2. OpenSolaris distributions may include additional bug fixes above and beyond the build from which it was derived. The base build can be derived as follows:

$ uname -v
snv_86

3. This issue only affects systems with ZFS file systems where local users have been granted the {PRIV_FILE_CHOWN_SELF} (see chown(2)) privilege which allows them to modify ownership of files where the ownership matches the user's current effective user ID. If the default operating system configuration option '{_POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED}' has been disabled then the 'file_chown_self' privilege is asserted in the inheritable set of all processes unless overridden by policy.conf(4) or user_attr(4)."
