The tqsl_verifyDataBlock function in openssl_cert.cpp in American Radio Relay League (ARRL) tqsllib 2.0 does not properly check the return value from the OpenSSL EVP_VerifyFinal function, which allows remote attackers to bypass validation of the certificate chain via a malformed SSL/TLS signature, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2008-5077.
