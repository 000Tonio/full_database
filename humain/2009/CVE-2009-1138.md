# CVE-2009-1138

- Published: 2009-06-10T18:00:00

- Modified: 2019-04-30T14:27:00

The LDAP service in Active Directory on Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4 does not properly free memory for LDAP and LDAPS requests, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a request that uses hexadecimal encoding, whose associated memory is not released, related to a "DN AttributeValue," aka "Active Directory Invalid Free Vulnerability."  NOTE: this issue is probably a memory leak.
