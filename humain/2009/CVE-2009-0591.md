# CVE-2009-0591

- Published: 2009-03-27T16:30:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:29:00

The CMS_verify function in OpenSSL 0.9.8h through 0.9.8j, when CMS is enabled, does not properly handle errors associated with malformed signed attributes, which allows remote attackers to repudiate a signature that originally appeared to be valid but was actually invalid.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
