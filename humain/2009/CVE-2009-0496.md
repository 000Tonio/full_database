Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Ignite Realtime Openfire 3.6.2 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) log parameter to (a) logviewer.jsp and (b) log.jsp; (2) search parameter to (c) group-summary.jsp; (3) username parameter to (d) user-properties.jsp; (4) logDir, (5) maxTotalSize, (6) maxFileSize, (7) maxDays, and (8) logTimeout parameters to (e) audit-policy.jsp; (9) propName parameter to (f) server-properties.jsp; and the (10) roomconfig_roomname and (11) roomconfig_roomdesc parameters to (g) muc-room-edit-form.jsp.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for arbitrary code execution by using XSS to upload a malicious plugin.
