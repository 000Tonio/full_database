# CVE-2009-2841

- Published: 2009-11-13T15:30:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:30:00

The HTMLMediaElement::loadResource function in html/HTMLMediaElement.cpp in WebCore in WebKit before r49480, as used in Apple Safari before 4.0.4 on Mac OS X, does not perform the expected callbacks for HTML 5 media elements that have external URLs for media resources, which allows remote attackers to trigger sub-resource requests to arbitrary web sites via a crafted HTML document, as demonstrated by an HTML e-mail message that uses a media element for X-Confirm-Reading-To functionality, aka rdar problem 7271202.

### CVSS Score: **5**
