Unspecified vulnerability on Cisco Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA) 5500 Series devices 8.0 before 8.0(4)25 and 8.1 before 8.1(2)15, when an SSL VPN or ASDM access is configured, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device reload) via a crafted (1) SSL or (2) HTTP packet. Per vendor advisory: http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_advisory09186a0080a994f6.shtml

VPN Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

The Cisco ASA or Cisco PIX security appliance can be configured to override an account-disabled indication from a AAA server and allow the user to log on anyway. However, the user must provide the correct credentials in order to login to the VPN. A vulnerability exists in the Cisco ASA and Cisco PIX security appliances where VPN users can bypass authentication when the override account feature is enabled.

Note:  The override account feature was introduced in Cisco ASA software version 7.1(1).

The override account feature is enabled with the override-account-disable command in tunnel-group general-attributes configuration mode, as shown in the following example. The following example allows overriding the "account-disabled" indicator from the AAA server for the WebVPN tunnel group "testgroup":

    hostname(config)#tunnel-group testgroup type webvpn
    hostname(config)#tunnel-group testgroup general-attributes
    hostname(config-tunnel-general)#override-account-disable

Note:  The override account feature is disabled by default.
