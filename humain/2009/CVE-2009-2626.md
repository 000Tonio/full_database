The zend_restore_ini_entry_cb function in zend_ini.c in PHP 5.3.0, 5.2.10, and earlier versions allows context-specific attackers to obtain sensitive information (memory contents) and cause a PHP crash by using the ini_set function to declare a variable, then using the ini_restore function to restore the variable.
