- Published: 2009-10-22T16:30:00

- Modified: 2009-10-31T06:22:00

SystemTap 1.0, when the --unprivileged option is used, does not properly restrict certain data sizes, which allows local users to (1) cause a denial of service or gain privileges via a print operation with a large number of arguments that trigger a kernel stack overflow, (2) cause a denial of service via crafted DWARF expressions that trigger a kernel stack frame overflow, or (3) cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via vectors that trigger creation of large unwind tables, related to Common Information Entry (CIE) and Call Frame Instruction (CFI) records.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
