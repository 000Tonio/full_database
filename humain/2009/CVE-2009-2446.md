Multiple format string vulnerabilities in the dispatch_command function in libmysqld/sql_parse.cc in mysqld in MySQL 4.0.0 through 5.0.83 allow remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly have unspecified other impact via format string specifiers in a database name in a (1) COM_CREATE_DB or (2) COM_DROP_DB request.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
