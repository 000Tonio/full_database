# CVE-2009-1381

- Published: 2009-05-22T20:30:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:20:00

The map_yp_alias function in functions/imap_general.php in SquirrelMail before 1.4.19-1 on Debian GNU/Linux, and possibly other operating systems and versions, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a username string that is used by the ypmatch program. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2009-1579.
