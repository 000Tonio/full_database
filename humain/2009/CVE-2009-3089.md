IBM Tivoli Directory Server (TDS) 6.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via unspecified vectors, related to (1) the ibmslapd.exe daemon on Windows and (2) the ibmdiradm daemon in the administration server on Linux, as demonstrated by certain modules in VulnDisco Pack Professional 8.11, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-0717.  NOTE: as of 20090903, this disclosure has no actionable information. However, because the VulnDisco Pack author is a reliable researcher, the issue is being assigned a CVE identifier for tracking purposes.
