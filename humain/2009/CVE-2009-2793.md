- Published: 2009-09-18T22:30:00

The kernel in NetBSD, probably 5.0.1 and earlier, on x86 platforms does not properly handle a pre-commit failure of the iret instruction, which might allow local users to gain privileges via vectors related to a tempEIP pseudocode variable that is outside of the code-segment limits.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
