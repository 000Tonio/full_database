# CVE-2009-1171

- Published: 2009-03-30T22:30:00

The TeX filter in Moodle 1.6 before 1.6.9+, 1.7 before 1.7.7+, 1.8 before 1.8.9, and 1.9 before 1.9.5 allows user-assisted attackers to read arbitrary files via an input command in a "$$" sequence, which causes LaTeX to include the contents of the file.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
