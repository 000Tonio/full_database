inc/functions_time.php in MyBB (aka MyBulletinBoard) 1.4.10, and possibly earlier versions, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted request with a large year value, which triggers a long loop, as reachable through member.php and possibly other vectors.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
