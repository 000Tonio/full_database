# CVE-2009-0418

- Published: 2009-02-04T19:30:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:33:00

The IPv6 Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) implementation in HP HP-UX B.11.11, B.11.23, and B.11.31 does not validate the origin of Neighbor Discovery messages, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (loss of connectivity), read private network traffic, and possibly execute arbitrary code via a spoofed message that modifies the Forward Information Base (FIB), a related issue to CVE-2008-2476.
