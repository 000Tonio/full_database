Opera before 10.00 does not properly handle a (1) '\0' character or (2) invalid wildcard character in a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
