A certain Red Hat patch for acpid 1.0.4 effectively triggers a call to the open function with insufficient arguments, which might allow local users to leverage weak permissions on /var/log/acpid, and obtain sensitive information by reading this file, cause a denial of service by overwriting this file, or gain privileges by executing this file.
