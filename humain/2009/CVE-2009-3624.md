# CVE-2009-3624

- Published: 2009-11-02T15:30:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T01:17:00

The get_instantiation_keyring function in security/keys/keyctl.c in the KEYS subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.32-rc5 does not properly maintain the reference count of a keyring, which allows local users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (OOPS) via vectors involving calls to this function without specifying a keyring by ID, as demonstrated by a series of keyctl request2 and keyctl list commands.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
