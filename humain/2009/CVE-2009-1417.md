- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:30:00

gnutls-cli in GnuTLS before 2.6.6 does not verify the activation and expiration times of X.509 certificates, which allows remote attackers to successfully present a certificate that is (1) not yet valid or (2) no longer valid, related to lack of time checks in the _gnutls_x509_verify_certificate function in lib/x509/verify.c in libgnutls_x509, as used by (a) Exim, (b) OpenLDAP, and (c) libsoup.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
