The kernel in Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP2 and SP3, Server 2003 SP2, Vista Gold and SP1, and Server 2008 Gold does not properly validate data sent from user mode, which allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted PE .exe file that triggers a NULL pointer dereference during chain traversal, aka "Windows Kernel NULL Pointer Dereference Vulnerability."
