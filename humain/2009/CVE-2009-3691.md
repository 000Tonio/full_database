Multiple integer overflows in setnet32.exe 3.50.0.13752 in IBM Informix Client SDK 3.0 and 3.50 and Informix Connect Runtime 3.x allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a .nfx file with a crafted (1) HostSize, and possibly (2) ProtoSize and (3) ServerSize, field that triggers a stack-based buffer overflow involving a crafted HostList field.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
