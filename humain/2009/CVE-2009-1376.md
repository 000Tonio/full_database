# CVE-2009-1376

- Published: 2009-05-26T15:30:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:20:00

Multiple integer overflows in the msn_slplink_process_msg functions in the MSN protocol handler in (1) libpurple/protocols/msn/slplink.c and (2) libpurple/protocols/msnp9/slplink.c in Pidgin (formerly Gaim) before 2.5.6 on 32-bit platforms allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a malformed SLP message with a crafted offset value, leading to buffer overflows. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-2927.
