Multiple integer overflows in LibThai before 0.1.13 might allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via long strings that trigger heap-based buffer overflows, related to (1) thbrk/thbrk.c and (2) thwbrk/thwbrk.c.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
