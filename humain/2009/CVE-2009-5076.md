# CVE-2009-5076

CRE Loaded before 6.2.14, and possibly other versions before 6.3.x, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and gain administrator privileges via a request with (1) login.php or (2) password_forgotten.php appended as the PATH_INFO, which bypasses a check that uses PHP_SELF, which is not properly handled by (a) includes/application_top.php and (b) admin/includes/application_top.php, as exploited in the wild in 2009.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
