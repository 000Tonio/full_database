Insecure method vulnerability in the PDFVIEWER.PDFViewerCtrl.1 ActiveX control (pdfviewer.ocx) in Edraw PDF Viewer Component before 3.2.0.126 allows remote attackers to create and overwrite arbitrary files via a URL argument to the FtpConnect argument and a target filename argument to the FtpDownloadFile method.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for code execution by writing to a Startup folder.
