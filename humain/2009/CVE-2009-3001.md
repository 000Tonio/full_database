# CVE-2009-3001

- Published: 2009-08-28T15:30:00

- Modified: 2018-11-16T15:40:00

The llc_ui_getname function in net/llc/af_llc.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.31-rc7 and earlier does not initialize a certain data structure, which allows local users to read the contents of some kernel memory locations by calling getsockname on an AF_LLC socket.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
