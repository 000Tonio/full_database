The NET_TCP_LISTEN function in net.c in Zabbix Agent before 1.6.7, when running on FreeBSD or Solaris, allows remote attackers to bypass the EnableRemoteCommands setting and execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in the argument to net.tcp.listen.  NOTE: this attack is limited to attacks from trusted IP addresses.
