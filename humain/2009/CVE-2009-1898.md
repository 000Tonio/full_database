The secure login page in the Administrative Console component in IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) 6.0.2 before 6.0.2.35 does not redirect to an https page upon receiving an http request, which makes it easier for remote attackers to read the contents of WAS sessions by sniffing the network.

### CVSS Score: **5**
