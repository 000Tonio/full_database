# CVE-2009-4146

- Published: 2009-12-02T18:30:00

- Modified: 2019-05-22T03:29:00

The _rtld function in the Run-Time Link-Editor (rtld) in libexec/rtld-elf/rtld.c in FreeBSD 7.1, 7.2, and 8.0 does not clear the LD_PRELOAD environment variable, which allows local users to gain privileges by executing a setuid or setguid program with a modified LD_PRELOAD variable containing an untrusted search path that points to a Trojan horse library, a different vector than CVE-2009-4147.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
