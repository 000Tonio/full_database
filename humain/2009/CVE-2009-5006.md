The SessionAdapter::ExchangeHandlerImpl::checkAlternate function in broker/SessionAdapter.cpp in the C++ Broker component in Apache Qpid before 0.6, as used in Red Hat Enterprise MRG before 1.3 and other products, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference, daemon crash, and cluster outage) by attempting to modify the alternate of an exchange.

### CVSS Score: **4**
