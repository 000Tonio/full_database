Stack consumption vulnerability in validators/DTD/DTDScanner.cpp in Apache Xerces C++ 2.7.0 and 2.8.0 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via vectors involving nested parentheses and invalid byte values in "simply nested DTD structures," as demonstrated by the Codenomicon XML fuzzing framework.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
