# CVE-2009-4635

- Published: 2010-02-10T02:30:00

- Modified: 2011-10-26T02:44:00

FFmpeg 0.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted MOV container with improperly ordered tags that cause (1) mov.c and (2) utils.c to use inconsistent codec types and identifiers, leading to processing of a video-structure pointer by the mp3 decoder, and a stack-based buffer overflow.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
