** DISPUTED **  SQL injection vulnerability in the Sigsiu Online Business Index 2 (SOBI2, com_sobi2) RC 2.8.2 component for Joomla! and Mambo allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the bid parameter in a showbiz action to index.php, a different vector than CVE-2008-0607.  NOTE: CVE disputes this issue, since neither "showbiz" nor "bid" appears in the source code for SOBI2.
