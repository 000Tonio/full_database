# CVE-2009-2661

- Published: 2009-08-04T16:30:00

- Modified: 2009-11-24T07:02:00

The asn1_length function in strongSwan 2.8 before 2.8.11, 4.2 before 4.2.17, and 4.3 before 4.3.3 does not properly handle X.509 certificates with crafted Relative Distinguished Names (RDNs), which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (pluto IKE daemon crash) via malformed ASN.1 data.  NOTE: this is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2009-2185.

### CVSS Score: **5**
