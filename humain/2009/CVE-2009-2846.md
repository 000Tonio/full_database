# CVE-2009-2846

- Published: 2009-08-18T21:00:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:30:00

The eisa_eeprom_read function in the parisc isa-eeprom component (drivers/parisc/eisa_eeprom.c) in the Linux kernel before 2.6.31-rc6 allows local users to access restricted memory via a negative ppos argument, which bypasses a check that assumes that ppos is positive and causes an out-of-bounds read in the readb function.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
