The implementation of Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in WebKit, as used in Apple Safari before 4.0.4 and Google Chrome before 3.0.195.33, includes certain custom HTTP headers in the OPTIONS request during cross-origin operations with preflight, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks via a crafted web page.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
