- Published: 2009-05-18T18:30:00

Multiple static code injection vulnerabilities in the saveFeed function in rss/feedcreator.class.php in Bitweaver 2.6 and earlier allow (1) remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary PHP code into files by placing PHP sequences into the account's "display name" setting and then invoking boards/boards_rss.php, and might allow (2) remote attackers to inject arbitrary PHP code into files via the HTTP Host header in a request to boards/boards_rss.php.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
