# CVE-2009-3525

- Published: 2009-10-05T19:30:00

- Modified: 2017-09-19T01:29:00

The pyGrub boot loader in Xen 3.0.3, 3.3.0, and Xen-3.3.1 does not support the password option in grub.conf for para-virtualized guests, which allows attackers with access to the para-virtualized guest console to boot the guest or modify the guest's kernel boot parameters without providing the expected password.
