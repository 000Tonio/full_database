Use-after-free vulnerability in the servePendingRequests function in WebCore in WebKit in Apple Safari 4.0 and 4.0.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted HTML document that references a zero-length .js file and the JavaScript reload function.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
