# CVE-2009-1255

- Published: 2009-04-30T20:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T19:35:00

The process_stat function in (1) Memcached before 1.2.8 and (2) MemcacheDB 1.2.0 discloses (a) the contents of /proc/self/maps in response to a stats maps command and (b) memory-allocation statistics in response to a stats malloc command, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information such as the locations of memory regions, and defeat ASLR protection, by sending a command to the daemon's TCP port.

### CVSS Score: **5**
