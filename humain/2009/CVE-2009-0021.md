# CVE-2009-0021

- Published: 2009-01-07T17:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:58:00

NTP 4.2.4 before 4.2.4p5 and 4.2.5 before 4.2.5p150 does not properly check the return value from the OpenSSL EVP_VerifyFinal function, which allows remote attackers to bypass validation of the certificate chain via a malformed SSL/TLS signature for DSA and ECDSA keys, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2008-5077. Note that versions 4.2.5 before 4.2.5p150 are development versions and not production versions.  Development versions are not included in the CPE configuration for CVEs.
