Multiple open redirect vulnerabilities in TBDev.NET 01-01-08 allow remote attackers to redirect users to arbitrary web sites and conduct phishing attacks via (1) the returnto parameter to login.php or (2) the returnto parameter in a delete action to news.php.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for cross-site scripting (XSS) by redirecting to a data: URI.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
