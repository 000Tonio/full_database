Comment RSS 5.x before 5.x-2.2 and 6.x before 6.x-2.2, a module for Drupal, does not properly enforce permissions when a link is added to the RSS feed, which allows remote attackers to obtain the node title and possibly other sensitive content by reading the feed.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
