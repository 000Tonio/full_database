The default configuration of Apache Tomcat in Websense Manager in Websense Web Security 7.0 and Web Filter 7.0 enables weak SSL ciphers in conf/server.xml, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network and then conducting a brute-force attack against encrypted session data.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
