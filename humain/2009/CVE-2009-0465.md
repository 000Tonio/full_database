The SaveDoc method in the All_In_The_Box.AllBox ActiveX control in ALL_IN_THE_BOX.OCX in Synactis ALL In-The-Box ActiveX 3 allows remote attackers to create and overwrite arbitrary files via an argument ending in a '\0' character, which bypasses the intended .box filename extension, as demonstrated by a C:\boot.ini\0 argument.
