# CVE-2009-1836

- Published: 2009-06-12T21:30:00

Mozilla Firefox before 3.0.11, Thunderbird before 2.0.0.22, and SeaMonkey before 1.1.17 use the HTTP Host header to determine the context of a document provided in a non-200 CONNECT response from a proxy server, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary web script by modifying this CONNECT response, aka an "SSL tampering" attack.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
