- Published: 2009-06-23T21:30:00

The Foxit JPEG2000/JBIG2 Decoder add-on before 2.0.2009.616 for Foxit Reader 3.0 before Build 1817 does not properly handle a fatal error during decoding of a JPEG2000 (aka JPX) header, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PDF file that triggers an invalid memory access.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**
