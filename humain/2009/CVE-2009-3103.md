# CVE-2009-3103

- Published: 2009-09-08T22:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-12T21:52:00

Array index error in the SMBv2 protocol implementation in srv2.sys in Microsoft Windows Vista Gold, SP1, and SP2, Windows Server 2008 Gold and SP2, and Windows 7 RC allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (system crash) via an & (ampersand) character in a Process ID High header field in a NEGOTIATE PROTOCOL REQUEST packet, which triggers an attempted dereference of an out-of-bounds memory location, aka "SMBv2 Negotiation Vulnerability." NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
