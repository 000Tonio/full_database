Polipo 1.0.4, and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a request with a Cache-Control header that lacks a value for the max-age field, which triggers a segmentation fault in the httpParseHeaders function in http_parse.c, and possibly other unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **5**
