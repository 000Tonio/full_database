# CVE-2009-0872

- Published: 2009-03-11T14:19:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:30:00

The NFS server in Sun Solaris 10, and OpenSolaris before snv_111, does not properly implement the AUTH_NONE (aka sec=none) security mode in combination with other security modes, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and read or modify files, as demonstrated by a combination of the AUTH_NONE and AUTH_SYS security modes.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
