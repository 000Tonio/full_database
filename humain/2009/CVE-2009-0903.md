IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) 7.0 before 7.0.0.3, and the Feature Pack for Web Services for WAS 6.1 before 6.1.0.25, when a WS-Security policy is established at the operation level, does not properly handle inbound requests that lack a SOAPAction or WS-Addressing Action, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a crafted request to a JAX-WS application.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
