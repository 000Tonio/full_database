# CVE-2009-2762

wp-login.php in WordPress 2.8.3 and earlier allows remote attackers to force a password reset for the first user in the database, possibly the administrator, via a key[] array variable in a resetpass (aka rp) action, which bypasses a check that assumes that $key is not an array.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
