# CVE-2009-5063

- Published: 2011-08-31T23:55:00

- Modified: 2020-09-09T14:51:00

Memory leak in the embedded_profile_len function in pngwutil.c in libpng before 1.2.39beta5 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory leak or segmentation fault) via a JPEG image containing an iCCP chunk with a negative embedded profile length.  NOTE: this is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2006-7244.
