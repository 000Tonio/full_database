# CVE-2009-3024

- Published: 2009-08-31T20:30:00

- Modified: 2011-01-20T06:35:00

The verify_hostname_of_cert function in the certificate checking feature in IO-Socket-SSL (IO::Socket::SSL) 1.14 through 1.25 only matches the prefix of a hostname when no wildcard is used, which allows remote attackers to bypass the hostname check for a certificate.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
