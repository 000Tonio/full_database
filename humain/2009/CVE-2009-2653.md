** DISPUTED **  The NtUserConsoleControl function in win32k.sys in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3, and Server 2003 before SP1, allows local administrators to bypass unspecified "security software" and gain privileges via a crafted call that triggers an overwrite of an arbitrary memory location.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this report, stating that 'the Administrator to SYSTEM "escalation" is not a security boundary we defend.'

### CVSS Score: **4.6**
