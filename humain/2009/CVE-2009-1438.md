# CVE-2009-1438

- Published: 2009-04-27T18:00:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:30:00

Integer overflow in the CSoundFile::ReadMed function (src/load_med.cpp) in libmodplug before 0.8.6, as used in gstreamer-plugins, TTPlayer, and other products, allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a MED file with a crafted (1) song comment or (2) song name, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow, as exploited in the wild in August 2008.
