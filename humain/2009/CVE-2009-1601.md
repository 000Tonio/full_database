# CVE-2009-1601

- Published: 2009-05-11T15:30:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:30:00

The Ubuntu clamav-milter.init script in clamav-milter before 0.95.1+dfsg-1ubuntu1.2 in Ubuntu 9.04 sets the ownership of the current working directory to the clamav account, which might allow local users to bypass intended access restrictions via read or write operations involving this directory. Per https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/clamav/+bug/365823

A clean install of clamav-milter (0.95.1+dfsg-1ubuntu1.1) causes the root directory to become owned by the clamav user.

This was witnessed breaking ssh chroot environment.

TEST CASE:
- purge any existing clamav-milter installation, make sure you don't have any old /etc/init.d/clamav-milter init script around
- check root directory's owner (should be root:root)
- sudo apt-get install clamav-milter (the last one in Jaunty is 0.95.1+dfsg-1ubuntu1.1)
- after installing the package, clamav-milter will start automatically (at least 'init.d/clamav-milter start' will execute)
- check the root directory's owner:
