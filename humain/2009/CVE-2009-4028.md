# CVE-2009-4028

- Published: 2009-11-30T17:30:00

The vio_verify_callback function in viosslfactories.c in MySQL 5.0.x before 5.0.88 and 5.1.x before 5.1.41, when OpenSSL is used, accepts a value of zero for the depth of X.509 certificates, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL-based MySQL servers via a crafted certificate, as demonstrated by a certificate presented by a server linked against the yaSSL library.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
