# CVE-2009-0993

- Published: 2009-04-15T10:30:00

Unspecified vulnerability in the OPMN component in Oracle Application Server 10.1.2.3 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the April 2009 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on reliable researcher claims that this issue is a format string vulnerability that allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in an HTTP POST URI, which are not properly handled when logging to opmn/logs/opmn.log.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
