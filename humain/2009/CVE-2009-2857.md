# CVE-2009-2857

- Published: 2009-08-19T17:30:00

- Modified: 2017-09-19T01:29:00

The kernel in Sun Solaris 8, 9, and 10, and OpenSolaris before snv_103, does not properly handle interaction between the filesystem and virtual-memory implementations, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (deadlock and system halt) via vectors involving mmap and write operations on the same file.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
