Directory traversal vulnerability in InstallHFZ.exe 6.5.201.0 in Pinnacle Hollywood Effects 6, a module in Pinnacle Systems Pinnacle Studio 12, allows remote attackers to create and overwrite arbitrary files via a filename containing a ..\ (dot dot backslash) sequence in a Hollywood FX Compressed Archive (.hfz) file.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for code execution by decompressing a file to a Startup folder.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
