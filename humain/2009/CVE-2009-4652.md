- Published: 2010-02-26T18:30:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:31:00

The (1) Conn_GetCipherInfo and (2) Conn_UsesSSL functions in src/ngircd/conn.c in ngIRCd 13 and 14, when SSL/TLS support is present and standalone mode is disabled, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) by sending the MOTD command from another server in the same IRC network, possibly related to an array index error.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
