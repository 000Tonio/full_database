# CVE-2009-0858

- Published: 2009-03-09T21:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T19:32:00

The response_addname function in response.c in Daniel J. Bernstein djbdns 1.05 and earlier does not constrain offsets in the required manner, which allows remote attackers, with control over a third-party subdomain served by tinydns and axfrdns, to trigger DNS responses containing arbitrary records via crafted zone data for this subdomain.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
