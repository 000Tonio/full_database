# CVE-2009-4634

- Published: 2010-02-10T02:30:00

- Modified: 2011-10-26T02:44:00

Multiple integer underflows in FFmpeg 0.5 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted file that (1) bypasses a validation check in vorbis_dec.c and triggers a wraparound of the stack pointer, or (2) access a pointer from out-of-bounds memory in mov.c, related to an elst tag that appears before a tag that creates a stream.

### CVSS Score: **10**
