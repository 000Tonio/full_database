src/net/http/http_transaction_winhttp.cc in Google Chrome before 1.0.154.53 uses the HTTP Host header to determine the context of a document provided in a (1) 4xx or (2) 5xx CONNECT response from a proxy server, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary web script by modifying this CONNECT response, aka an "SSL tampering" attack.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
