# CVE-2009-1882

- Published: 2009-06-02T15:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T19:38:00

Integer overflow in the XMakeImage function in magick/xwindow.c in ImageMagick 6.5.2-8, and GraphicsMagick, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted TIFF file, which triggers a buffer overflow.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
