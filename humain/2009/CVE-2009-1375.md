- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:34:00

The PurpleCircBuffer implementation in Pidgin (formerly Gaim) before 2.5.6 does not properly maintain a certain buffer, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via vectors involving the (1) XMPP or (2) Sametime protocol.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
