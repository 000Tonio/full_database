# CVE-2009-0835

- Published: 2009-03-06T11:30:00

- Modified: 2012-03-19T04:00:00

The __secure_computing function in kernel/seccomp.c in the seccomp subsystem in the Linux kernel 2.6.28.7 and earlier on the x86_64 platform, when CONFIG_SECCOMP is enabled, does not properly handle (1) a 32-bit process making a 64-bit syscall or (2) a 64-bit process making a 32-bit syscall, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions via crafted syscalls that are misinterpreted as (a) stat or (b) chmod, a related issue to CVE-2009-0342 and CVE-2009-0343.
