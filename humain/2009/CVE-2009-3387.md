Bugzilla 3.3.1 through 3.4.4, 3.5.1, and 3.5.2 does not allow group restrictions to be preserved throughout the process of moving a bug to a different product category, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a request for a bug in opportunistic circumstances.

### CVSS Score: **5**
