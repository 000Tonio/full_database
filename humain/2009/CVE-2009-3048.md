Opera before 10.00 on Linux, Solaris, and FreeBSD does not properly implement the "INPUT TYPE=file" functionality, which allows remote attackers to trick a user into uploading an unintended file via vectors involving a "dropped file."

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
