# CVE-2009-4128

- Published: 2009-12-01T16:30:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:31:00

GNU GRand Unified Bootloader (GRUB) 2 1.97 only compares the submitted portion of a password with the actual password, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to conduct brute force attacks and bypass authentication by submitting a password whose length is 1.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
