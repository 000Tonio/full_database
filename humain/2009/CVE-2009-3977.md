Multiple buffer overflows in a certain ActiveX control in ActiveDom.ocx in HP OpenView Network Node Manager (OV NNM) 7.53 might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or have unspecified other impact via a long string argument to the (1) DisplayName, (2) AddGroup, (3) InstallComponent, or (4) Subscribe method.  NOTE: this issue is not a vulnerability in many environments, because the control is not marked as safe for scripting and would not execute with default Internet Explorer settings.
