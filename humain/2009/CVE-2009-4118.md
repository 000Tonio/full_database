- Published: 2009-12-01T00:30:00

- Modified: 2012-10-25T04:00:00

The StartServiceCtrlDispatcher function in the cvpnd service (cvpnd.exe) in Cisco VPN client for Windows before 5.0.06.0100 does not properly handle an ERROR_FAILED_SERVICE_CONTROLLER_CONNECT error, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (service crash and VPN connection loss) via a manual start of cvpnd.exe while the cvpnd service is running.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
