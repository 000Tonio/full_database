Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in AlmondSoft Almond Classifieds Wap and Pro, and possibly Almond Affiliate Network Classifieds, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the page parameter in a browse action to index.php or (2) the addr parameter to gmap.php.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
