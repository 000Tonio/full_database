Integer overflow in the wxImage::Create function in src/common/image.cpp in wxWidgets 2.8.10 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted JPEG file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information.
