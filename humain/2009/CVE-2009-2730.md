# CVE-2009-2730

- Published: 2009-08-12T10:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T19:42:00

libgnutls in GnuTLS before 2.8.2 does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the subject's (1) Common Name (CN) or (2) Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
