# CVE-2009-2856

- Published: 2009-08-18T22:30:00

- Modified: 2009-08-21T15:25:00

Sun Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) 3.0, when anonymous binding is enabled, does not properly handle a client's attempt to establish an authenticated and encrypted connection, which might allow remote attackers to read cleartext VDI configuration-data requests by sniffing LDAP sessions on the network.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
