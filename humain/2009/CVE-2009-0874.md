Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the Doors subsystem in the kernel in Sun Solaris 8 through 10, and OpenSolaris before snv_94, allow local users to cause a denial of service (process hang), or possibly bypass file permissions or gain kernel-context privileges, via vectors including ones related to (1) an argument handling deadlock in a door server and (2) watchpoint problems in the door_call function.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**
