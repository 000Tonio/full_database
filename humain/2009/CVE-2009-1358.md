# CVE-2009-1358

- Published: 2009-04-21T23:30:00

- Modified: 2020-01-08T15:11:00

apt-get in apt before 0.7.21 does not check for the correct error code from gpgv, which causes apt to treat a repository as valid even when it has been signed with a key that has been revoked or expired, which might allow remote attackers to trick apt into installing malicious repositories.

### CVSS Score: **10**
