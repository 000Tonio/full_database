Mozilla Firefox 3.6a1, 3.5.3, 3.5.2, and earlier 3.5.x versions, and 3.0.14 and earlier 2.x and 3.x versions, on Linux uses a predictable /tmp pathname for files selected from the Downloads window, which allows local users to replace an arbitrary downloaded file by placing a file in a /tmp location before the download occurs, related to the Download Manager component. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
