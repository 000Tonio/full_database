Race condition in the FTPHandler class in ftpserver.py in pyftpdlib before 0.5.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon outage) by establishing and then immediately closing a TCP connection, leading to the getpeername function having an ENOTCONN error, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-3494.
