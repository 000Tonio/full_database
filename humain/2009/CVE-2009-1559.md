# CVE-2009-1559

- Published: 2009-05-06T16:30:00

Absolute path traversal vulnerability in adm/file.cgi on the Cisco Linksys WVC54GCA wireless video camera with firmware 1.00R24 and possibly 1.00R22 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via an absolute pathname in the this_file parameter.  NOTE: traversal via a .. (dot dot) is probably also possible.
