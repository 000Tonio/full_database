# CVE-2009-1044

- Published: 2009-03-23T14:19:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T19:32:00

Mozilla Firefox 3.0.7 on Windows 7 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors related to the _moveToEdgeShift XUL tree method, which triggers garbage collection on objects that are still in use, as demonstrated by Nils during a PWN2OWN competition at CanSecWest 2009.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
