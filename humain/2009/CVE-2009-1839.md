Mozilla Firefox 3 before 3.0.11 associates an incorrect principal with a file: URL loaded through the location bar, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and read files via a crafted HTML document, aka a "file-URL-to-file-URL scripting" attack.

### CVSS Score: **5.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
