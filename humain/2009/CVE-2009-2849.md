# CVE-2009-2849

- Published: 2009-08-18T21:00:00

- Modified: 2017-09-19T01:29:00

The md driver (drivers/md/md.c) in the Linux kernel before 2.6.30.2 might allow local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via vectors related to "suspend_* sysfs attributes" and the (1) suspend_lo_store or (2) suspend_hi_store functions.  NOTE: this is only a vulnerability when sysfs is writable by an attacker.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
