# CVE-2009-4593

- Published: 2010-01-07T18:30:00

- Modified: 2010-01-08T05:00:00

The bftpdutmp_log function in bftpdutmp.c in Bftpd before 2.4 does not place a '\0' character at the end of the string value of the ut.bu_host structure member, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via unspecified vectors. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
