McAfee GroupShield for Microsoft Exchange on Exchange Server 2000, and possibly other anti-virus or anti-spam products from McAfee or other vendors, does not scan X- headers for malicious content, which allows remote attackers to bypass virus detection via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message with an X-Testing header and no message body.
