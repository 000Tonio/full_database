# CVE-2009-1298

- Published: 2009-12-08T23:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T19:35:00

The ip_frag_reasm function in net/ipv4/ip_fragment.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.32-rc8, and 2.6.29 and later versions before 2.6.32, calls IP_INC_STATS_BH with an incorrect argument, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and hang) via long IP packets, possibly related to the ip_defrag function.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |
