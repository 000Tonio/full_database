# CVE-2009-1046

- Published: 2009-03-23T16:30:00

- Modified: 2016-05-31T15:08:00

The console selection feature in the Linux kernel 2.6.28 before 2.6.28.4, 2.6.25, and possibly earlier versions, when the UTF-8 console is used, allows physically proximate attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) by selecting a small number of 3-byte UTF-8 characters, which triggers an "off-by-two memory error." NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue crosses privilege boundaries.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
