The Web Editor in Dassault Systemes ENOVIA SmarTeam V5 before Release 18 Service Pack 8, and possibly CATIA and other products, allows remote authenticated users to read the profile card of an object in the document class via a link that is sent from the owner of the document object. Per http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg1HD80332

"Scenario:
1. Create a document class and give permissions to joe only.
2. When someone else but joe logs onto Web editor, and does a
   search on this new class no results are returned as expected.
3. Login as joe and search for an object created for this new
   class. click on the email icon, and send the mail to bob.
4. When bob clicks on the link in the email, he can view the
   profile card of the object, but when he clicks on viewer he
   gets an unauthorized operation error. Bob shouldn't be able
   to view the profile card in the first place as he doesn't
   have any access to this class.  This is a security hole in
   the web editor."
