# CVE-2009-1720

- Published: 2009-07-31T19:00:00

- Modified: 2012-10-23T03:06:00

Multiple integer overflows in OpenEXR 1.2.2 and 1.6.1 allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors that trigger heap-based buffer overflows, related to (1) the Imf::PreviewImage::PreviewImage function and (2) compressor constructors.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
