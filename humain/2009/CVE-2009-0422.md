# CVE-2009-0422

- Published: 2009-02-05T00:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T21:01:00

Dynamic variable evaluation vulnerability in lists/admin.php in phpList 2.10.8 and earlier, when register_globals is disabled, allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via directory traversal sequences in the _SERVER[ConfigFile] parameter to admin/index.php. Register Globals are disabled by default, so this will not increase access complexity.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
