A certain algorithm in Ruby on Rails 2.1.0 through 2.2.2, and 2.3.x before 2.3.4, leaks information about the complexity of message-digest signature verification in the cookie store, which might allow remote attackers to forge a digest via multiple attempts.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
