A certain Red Hat patch for SquirrelMail 1.4.8 sets the same SQMSESSID cookie value for all sessions, which allows remote authenticated users to access other users' folder lists and configuration data in opportunistic circumstances by using the standard webmail.php interface. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2008-3663.
