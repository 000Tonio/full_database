The Workplace (aka WP) component in IBM FileNet P8 Application Engine (P8AE) 4.0.2.x before 4.0.2.2-P8AE-FP002 grants a document's Creator-Owner full control over an annotation object, even if the default instance security has changed, which might allow remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
