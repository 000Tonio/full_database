The IP-in-IP packet processing implementation in the IPsec and IP stacks in the kernel in Sun Solaris 9 and 10, and OpenSolaris snv_01 though snv_85, allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) via a self-encapsulated packet that lacks IPsec protection.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
