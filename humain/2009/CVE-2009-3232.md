- Published: 2009-09-17T10:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-03T22:01:00

pam-auth-update for PAM, as used in Ubuntu 8.10 and 9.4, and Debian GNU/Linux, does not properly handle an "empty selection" for system authentication modules in certain rare configurations, which causes any attempt to be successful and allows remote attackers to bypass authentication.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
