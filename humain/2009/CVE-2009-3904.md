# CVE-2009-3904

- Published: 2009-11-06T15:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T19:47:00

classes/session/cc_admin_session.php in CubeCart 4.3.4 does not properly restrict administrative access permissions, which allows remote attackers to bypass restrictions and gain administrative access via a HTTP request that contains an empty (1) sessID (ccAdmin cookie), (2) X_CLUSTER_CLIENT_IP header, or (3) User-Agent header.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
