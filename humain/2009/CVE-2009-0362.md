filter.d/wuftpd.conf in Fail2ban 0.8.3 uses an incorrect regular expression that allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (forced authentication failures) via a crafted reverse-resolved DNS name (rhost) entry that contains a substring that is interpreted as an IP address, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-4321.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
