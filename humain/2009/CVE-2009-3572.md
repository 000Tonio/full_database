# CVE-2009-3572

- Published: 2009-10-06T20:30:00

- Modified: 2009-10-08T04:00:00

OpenBSD 4.4, 4.5, and 4.6, when running on an i386 kernel, does not properly handle XMM exceptions, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel panic) via unspecified vectors. Per: http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-security-announce&m=125474331811594

XMM exceptions are incorrectly handled in the OpenBSD/i386 kernel, resulting
in a kernel panic that can be triggered by a local user.

This issue has been fixed in -current. Source code patches are available for
OpenBSD 4.4, 4.5 and 4.6.
