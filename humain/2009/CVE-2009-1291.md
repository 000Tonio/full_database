Stack-based buffer overflow in TIBCO SmartSockets before 6.8.2, SmartSockets Product Family (aka RTworks) before 4.0.5, and Enterprise Message Service (EMS) 4.0.0 through 5.1.1, as used in SmartSockets Server and RTworks Server (aka RTserver), SmartSockets client libraries and add-on products, RTworks libraries and components, EMS Server (aka tibemsd), SmartMQ, iProcess Engine, ActiveMatrix products, and CA Enterprise Communicator, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via "inbound data," as demonstrated by requests to the UDP interface of the RTserver component, and data injection into the TCP stream to tibemsd.
