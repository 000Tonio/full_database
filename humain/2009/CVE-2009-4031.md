# CVE-2009-4031

- Published: 2009-11-29T13:07:00

The do_insn_fetch function in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the x86 emulator in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.32-rc8-next-20091125 tries to interpret instructions that contain too many bytes to be valid, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (increased scheduling latency) on the host OS via unspecified manipulations related to SMP support.
