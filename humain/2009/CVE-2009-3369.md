CgiUserConfigEdit in BackupPC 3.1.0, when SSH keys and Rsync are in use in a multi-user environment, does not restrict users from the ClientNameAlias function, which allows remote authenticated users to read and write sensitive files by modifying ClientNameAlias to match another system, then initiating a backup or restore.

| --- | --- | --- |
