- Published: 2009-03-19T10:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T19:32:00

UserView_list.php in PHPRunner 4.2, and possibly earlier, stores passwords in cleartext in the database, which allows attackers to gain privileges.  NOTE: this can be leveraged with a separate SQL injection vulnerability to obtain passwords remotely without authentication.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
