# CVE-2009-0480

- Published: 2009-02-09T16:30:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:33:00

The IP implementation in Sun Solaris 8 through 10, and OpenSolaris before snv_82, uses an improper arena when allocating minor numbers for sockets, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (32-bit application failure and login outage) by opening a large number of sockets.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
