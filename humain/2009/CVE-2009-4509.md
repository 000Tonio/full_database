# CVE-2009-4509

- Published: 2010-04-13T17:30:00

The administrative web console on the TANDBERG Video Communication Server (VCS) before X4.3 uses predictable session cookies in (1) tandberg/web/lib/secure.php and (2) tandberg/web/user/lib/secure.php, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass authentication, and execute arbitrary code by loading a custom software update, via a crafted "Cookie: tandberg_login=" HTTP header.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
