The default configuration of Apache Tomcat in Websense Manager in Websense Web Security 7.0 and Web Filter 7.0 allows connections to TCP port 1812 from arbitrary source IP addresses, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via UTF-7 text to the 404 error page of a Project Woodstock service on this port.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
