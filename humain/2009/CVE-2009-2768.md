# CVE-2009-2768

- Published: 2009-08-14T15:16:00

- Modified: 2020-08-07T14:56:00

The load_flat_shared_library function in fs/binfmt_flat.c in the flat subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.31-rc6 allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by executing a shared flat binary, which triggers an access of an "uninitialized cred pointer."
