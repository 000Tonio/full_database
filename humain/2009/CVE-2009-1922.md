The Message Queuing (aka MSMQ) service for Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP2, Server 2003 SP2, and Vista Gold does not properly validate unspecified IOCTL request data from user mode before passing this data to kernel mode, which allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted request, aka "MSMQ Null Pointer Vulnerability."
