Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in IN_MOD.DLL (aka the Module Decoder Plug-in) in Winamp before 5.57, and libmikmod 3.1.12, might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) crafted samples or (2) crafted instrument definitions in an Impulse Tracker file.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
