# CVE-2009-4269

- Published: 2010-08-16T20:00:00

- Modified: 2011-01-26T06:41:00

The password hash generation algorithm in the BUILTIN authentication functionality for Apache Derby before 10.6.1.0 performs a transformation that reduces the size of the set of inputs to SHA-1, which produces a small search space that makes it easier for local and possibly remote attackers to crack passwords by generating hash collisions, related to password substitution. Per https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DERBY-4483, the reported version affected is 10.5.3.0.  Unable to determine if affected versions exist between 10.5.3.0 and 10.6.1.0

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
