Multiple absolute path traversal vulnerabilities in PHP-Calendar 1.1 allow remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a full pathname in the configfile parameter to (1) update08.php or (2) update10.php.  NOTE: in some environments, this can be leveraged for remote file inclusion by using a UNC share pathname or an ftp, ftps, or ssh2.sftp URL.
