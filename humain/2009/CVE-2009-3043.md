The tty_ldisc_hangup function in drivers/char/tty_ldisc.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.31-rc before 2.6.31-rc8 allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash, sometimes preceded by a NULL pointer dereference) or possibly gain privileges via certain pseudo-terminal I/O activity, as demonstrated by KernelTtyTest.c.
