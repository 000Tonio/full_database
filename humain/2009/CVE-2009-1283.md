# CVE-2009-1283

- Published: 2009-04-09T16:27:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:34:00

glFusion before 1.1.3 performs authentication with a user-provided password hash instead of a password, which allows remote attackers to gain privileges by obtaining the hash and using it in the glf_password cookie, aka "User Masquerading." NOTE: this can be leveraged with a separate SQL injection vulnerability to steal hashes.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
