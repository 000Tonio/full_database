# CVE-2009-2175

- Published: 2009-06-23T21:30:00

- Modified: 2011-01-04T05:00:00

Stack-based buffer overflow in the flattenIncrementally function in flatten.c in xcftools 1.0.4, as reachable from the (1) xcf2pnm and (2) xcf2png utilities, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted image that causes a conversion to a location "above or to the left of the canvas." NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
