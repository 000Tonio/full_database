Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in Tribiq CMS 5.0.12c, when register_globals is enabled and magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allow remote attackers to include and possibly execute arbitrary files via directory traversal sequences in the template_path parameter to (1) masthead.inc.php, (2) toppanel.inc.php, and (3) contact.inc.php in templates/mytribiqsite/tribiq-CL-9000/includes; and the use_template_family parameter to (4) templates/mytribiqsite/tribiq-CL-9000/includes/nlarlist_content.inc.php. NOTE: the tribal-GPL-1066/includes/header.inc.php vector is already covered by CVE-2008-4894.
