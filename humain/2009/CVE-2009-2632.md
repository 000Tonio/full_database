# CVE-2009-2632

- Published: 2009-09-08T23:30:00

- Modified: 2017-09-19T01:29:00

Buffer overflow in the SIEVE script component (sieve/script.c), as used in cyrus-imapd in Cyrus IMAP Server 2.2.13 and 2.3.14, and Dovecot 1.0 before 1.0.4 and 1.1 before 1.1.7, allows local users to execute arbitrary code and read or modify arbitrary messages via a crafted SIEVE script, related to the incorrect use of the sizeof operator for determining buffer length, combined with an integer signedness error.
