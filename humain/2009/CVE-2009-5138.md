# CVE-2009-5138

- Published: 2014-03-07T00:10:00

- Modified: 2014-04-01T05:44:00

GnuTLS before 2.7.6, when the GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT flag is not enabled, treats version 1 X.509 certificates as intermediate CAs, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended restrictions by leveraging a X.509 V1 certificate from a trusted CA to issue new certificates, a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-1959.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**
