# CVE-2009-0505

- Published: 2009-02-25T16:30:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:33:00

The CICS listener in IBM TXSeries for Multiplatforms 6.2 GA waits for a forcepurge acknowledgement from the CICS Application Server (CICSAS) after an eci response timeout, which might allow remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (forcepurge handling delay), or have unspecified other impact, via vectors involving slow or nonexistent acknowledgement.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
