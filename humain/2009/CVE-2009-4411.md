The (1) setfacl and (2) getfacl commands in XFS acl 2.2.47, when running in recursive (-R) mode, follow symbolic links even when the --physical (aka -P) or -L option is specified, which might allow local users to modify the ACL for arbitrary files or directories via a symlink attack.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | LOCAL |
