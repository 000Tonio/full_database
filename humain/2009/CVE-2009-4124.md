Heap-based buffer overflow in the rb_str_justify function in string.c in Ruby 1.9.1 before 1.9.1-p376 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors involving (1) String#ljust, (2) String#center, or (3) String#rjust.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
