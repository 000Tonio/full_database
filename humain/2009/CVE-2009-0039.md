Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the web administration console in Apache Geronimo Application Server 2.1 through 2.1.3 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) change the web administration password, (2) upload applications, and perform unspecified other administrative actions, as demonstrated by (3) a Shutdown request to console/portal//Server/Shutdown.
