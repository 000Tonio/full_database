The ICMPv6 implementation on the Apple Time Capsule, AirPort Extreme Base Station, and AirPort Express Base Station with firmware before 7.5.2 does not limit the rate of (1) Router Advertisement and (2) Neighbor Discovery packets, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption and device restart) by sending many packets.
