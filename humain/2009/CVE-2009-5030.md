The tcd_free_encode function in tcd.c in OpenJPEG 1.3 through 1.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted tile information in a Gray16 TIFF image, which causes insufficient memory to be allocated and leads to an "invalid free."

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
