# CVE-2009-0547

- Published: 2009-02-12T23:30:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:33:00

Evolution 2.22.3.1 checks S/MIME signatures against a copy of the e-mail text within a signed-data blob, not the copy of the e-mail text displayed to the user, which allows remote attackers to spoof a signature by modifying the latter copy, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-5077.
