win32k.sys in the kernel in Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP2 and SP3, and Server 2003 SP2 does not correctly parse font code during construction of a directory-entry table, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted Embedded OpenType (EOT) font, aka "Win32k EOT Parsing Vulnerability."
