The forgotten mail interface in WordPress and WordPress MU before 2.8.1 exhibits different behavior for a password request depending on whether the user account exists, which allows remote attackers to enumerate valid usernames.  NOTE: the vendor reportedly disputes the significance of this issue, indicating that the behavior exists for "user convenience."

### CVSS Score: **5**
