# CVE-2009-2659

- Published: 2009-08-04T16:30:00

- Modified: 2009-08-12T05:30:00

The Admin media handler in core/servers/basehttp.py in Django 1.0 and 0.96 does not properly map URL requests to expected "static media files," which allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks and read arbitrary files via a crafted URL.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
