- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:30:00

The NFSv4 server kernel module in Sun Solaris 10, and OpenSolaris before snv_119, does not properly implement the nfs_portmon setting, which allows remote attackers to access shares, and read, create, and modify arbitrary files, via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
