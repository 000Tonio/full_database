# CVE-2009-2006

- Published: 2009-06-08T19:30:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:30:00

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Dokeos 1.8.5, and possibly earlier, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) search_term parameter to main/auth/courses.php; the (2) frm_title and (3) frm_content parameters in a new personal agenda item action; the (4) title and (5) tutor_name parameters in a new course action; and the (6) student and (7) course parameters to main/mySpace/myStudents.php.  NOTE: vectors 2 and 3 might only be exploitable via a separate CSRF vulnerability.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
