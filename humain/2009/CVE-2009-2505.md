The Internet Authentication Service (IAS) in Microsoft Windows Vista SP2 and Server 2008 SP2 does not properly validate MS-CHAP v2 Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP) authentication requests, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted structures in a malformed request, aka "Internet Authentication Service Memory Corruption Vulnerability."

### CVSS Score: **10**

| --- | --- | --- |
