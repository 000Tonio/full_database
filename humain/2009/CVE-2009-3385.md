The mail component in Mozilla SeaMonkey before 1.1.19 does not properly restrict execution of scriptable plugin content, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via crafted content in an IFRAME element in an HTML e-mail message, as demonstrated by a Flash object that sends arbitrary local files during a reply or forward operation.
