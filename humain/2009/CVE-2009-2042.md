# CVE-2009-2042

- Published: 2009-06-12T20:30:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:30:00

libpng before 1.2.37 does not properly parse 1-bit interlaced images with width values that are not divisible by 8, which causes libpng to include uninitialized bits in certain rows of a PNG file and might allow remote attackers to read portions of sensitive memory via "out-of-bounds pixels" in the file.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
