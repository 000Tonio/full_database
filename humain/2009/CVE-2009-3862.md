The NDSD process in Novell eDirectory 8.7.3 before 8.7.3.10 ftf2 and eDirectory 8.8 before 8.8.5 ftf1 does not properly handle certain LDAP search requests, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application hang) via a search request with a NULL BaseDN value. Per: http://www.novell.com/support/viewContent.do?externalId=7004721

"Resolution
