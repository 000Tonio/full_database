Use-after-free vulnerability in the GIFReadNextExtension function in lib/pngxtern/gif/gifread.c in OptiPNG 0.6.2 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted GIF image that causes the realloc function to return a new pointer, which triggers memory corruption when the old pointer is accessed.
