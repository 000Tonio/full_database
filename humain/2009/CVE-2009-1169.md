- Published: 2009-03-27T00:30:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:34:00

The txMozillaXSLTProcessor::TransformToDoc function in Mozilla Firefox before 3.0.8 and SeaMonkey before 1.1.16 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via an XML file with a crafted XSLT transform. Per: http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/34235/info

Mozilla Firefox is prone to a remote memory-corruption vulnerability.

An attacker can exploit this issue to execute arbitrary code within the context of the affected browser. Failed exploit attempt will result in a denial-of-service condition.
