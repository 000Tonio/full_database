# CVE-2009-3759

- Published: 2009-10-22T17:30:00

- Modified: 2017-09-19T01:29:00

Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in sample code in the XenServer Resource Kit in Citrix XenCenterWeb allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for (1) requests that change the password via the username parameter to config/changepw.php or (2) stop a virtual machine via the stop_vmname parameter to hardstopvm.php.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.

### CVSS Score: **6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
