# CVE-2009-4308

- Published: 2009-12-13T01:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T19:48:00

The ext4_decode_error function in fs/ext4/super.c in the ext4 filesystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.32 allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference), and possibly have unspecified other impact, via a crafted read-only filesystem that lacks a journal.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
