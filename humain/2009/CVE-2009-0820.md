Multiple eval injection vulnerabilities in phpScheduleIt before 1.2.11 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) the end_date parameter to reserve.php and (2) the start_date and end_date parameters to check.php.  NOTE: the start_date/reserve.php vector is already covered by CVE-2008-6132.
