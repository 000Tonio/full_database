Opera before 10.01 does not properly restrict HTML in a (1) RSS or (2) Atom feed, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, and conduct cross-zone scripting attacks involving the Feed Subscription Page to read feeds or create feed subscriptions, via a crafted feed, related to the rendering of the application/rss+xml content type as "scripted content."

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
