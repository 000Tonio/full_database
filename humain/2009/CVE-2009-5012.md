- Modified: 2010-10-20T04:00:00

ftpserver.py in pyftpdlib before 0.5.2 does not require the l permission for the MLST command, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions and list the root directory via an FTP session.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
