- Published: 2009-05-14T17:30:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:34:00

functions/mime.php in SquirrelMail before 1.4.18 does not protect the application's content from Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) positioning in HTML e-mail messages, which allows remote attackers to spoof the user interface, and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) and phishing attacks, via a crafted message.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
