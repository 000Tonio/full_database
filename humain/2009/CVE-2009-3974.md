Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Invision Power Board (IPB or IP.Board) 3.0.0, 3.0.1, and 3.0.2 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) search_term parameter to admin/applications/core/modules_public/search/search.php and (2) aid parameter to admin/applications/core/modules_public/global/lostpass.php.  NOTE: on 20090818, the vendor patched 3.0.2 without changing the version number.
