# CVE-2009-2848

- Published: 2009-08-18T21:00:00

- Modified: 2020-08-28T13:10:00

The execve function in the Linux kernel, possibly 2.6.30-rc6 and earlier, does not properly clear the current->clear_child_tid pointer, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly gain privileges via a clone system call with CLONE_CHILD_SETTID or CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID enabled, which is not properly handled during thread creation and exit.

### CVSS Score: **5.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | COMPLETE |
