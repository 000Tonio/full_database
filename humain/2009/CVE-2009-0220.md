Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the PowerPoint 4.0 importer (PP4X32.DLL) in Microsoft Office PowerPoint 2000 SP3, 2002 SP3, and 2003 SP3 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted formatting data for paragraphs in a file that uses a PowerPoint 4.0 native file format, related to (1) an incorrect calculation from a record header, or (2) an interget that is used to specify the number of bytes to copy, aka "Legacy File Format Vulnerability."
