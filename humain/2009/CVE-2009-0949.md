- Published: 2009-06-09T17:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T19:32:00

The ippReadIO function in cups/ipp.c in cupsd in CUPS before 1.3.10 does not properly initialize memory for IPP request packets, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via a scheduler request with two consecutive IPP_TAG_UNSUPPORTED tags.

### CVSS Score: **5**
