Race condition in the tty_fasync function in drivers/char/tty_io.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.32.6 allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors, related to the put_tty_queue and __f_setown functions.  NOTE: the vulnerability was addressed in a different way in 2.6.32.9.
