IBM WebSphere Process Server (WPS) 6.1.2 before 6.1.2.3 and 6.2 before 6.2.0.1 does not properly restrict configuration data during an export of the cluster configuration file from the administrative console, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain the (1) JMSAPI, (2) ESCALATION, and (3) MAILSESSION (aka mail session) cleartext passwords via vectors involving access to a cluster member.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
