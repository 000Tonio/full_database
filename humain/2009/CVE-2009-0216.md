- Published: 2009-02-13T17:30:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:33:00

GE Fanuc iFIX 5.0 and earlier relies on client-side authentication involving a weakly encrypted local password file, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and start privileged server login sessions by recovering a password or by using a modified program module.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
