The graphics device interface (GDI) implementation in the kernel in Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP2 and SP3, Server 2003 SP1 and SP2, Vista Gold and SP1, and Server 2008 does not properly validate input received from user mode, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted (1) Windows Metafile (aka WMF) or (2) Enhanced Metafile (aka EMF) image file, aka "Windows Kernel Input Validation Vulnerability."
