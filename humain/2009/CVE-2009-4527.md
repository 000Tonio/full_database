The Shibboleth authentication module 5.x before 5.x-3.4 and 6.x before 6.x-3.2, a module for Drupal, does not properly remove statically granted privileges after a logout or other session change, which allows physically proximate attackers to gain privileges by using an unattended web browser.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
