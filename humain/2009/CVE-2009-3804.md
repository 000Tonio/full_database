Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in modules/forum/post.php in RunCMS 2M1 allow remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via (1) the pid parameter, which is not properly handled by the store function in modules/forum/class/class.forumposts.php, or (2) the topic_id parameter.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**
