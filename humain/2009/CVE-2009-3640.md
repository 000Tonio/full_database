# CVE-2009-3640

- Published: 2009-10-29T14:30:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:20:00

The update_cr8_intercept function in arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.32-rc1 does not properly handle the absence of an Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC), which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly gain privileges via a call to the kvm_vcpu_ioctl function.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
