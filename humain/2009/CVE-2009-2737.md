# CVE-2009-2737

- Published: 2009-08-11T10:30:00

- Modified: 2009-08-26T05:25:00

The EditCSVAction function in cgi/actions.py in Roundup 1.2 before 1.2.1, 1.4 through 1.4.6, and possibly other versions does not properly check permissions, which allows remote authenticated users with edit or create privileges for a class to modify arbitrary items within that class, as demonstrated by editing all queries, modifying settings, and adding roles to users.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
