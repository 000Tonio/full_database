IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager (TFIM) 6.2.0 before 6.2.0.2, when configured as an OpenID provider, does not delete the site information cookie in response to a user's deletion of a relying-party trust entry, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to bypass intended trust restrictions via vectors that trigger absence of the consent-to-authenticate page.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
