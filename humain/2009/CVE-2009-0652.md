# CVE-2009-0652

- Published: 2009-02-20T19:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-03T21:58:00

The Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) blacklist in Mozilla Firefox 3.0.6 and other versions before 3.0.9; Thunderbird before 2.0.0.21; and SeaMonkey before 1.1.15 does not include box-drawing characters, which allows remote attackers to spoof URLs and conduct phishing attacks, as demonstrated by homoglyphs of the / (slash) and ? (question mark) characters in a subdomain of a .cn domain name, a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-0233.  NOTE: some third parties claim that 3.0.6 is not affected, but much older versions perhaps are affected.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**
