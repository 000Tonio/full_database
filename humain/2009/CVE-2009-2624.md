# CVE-2009-2624

- Published: 2010-01-29T18:30:00

- Modified: 2010-11-18T06:29:00

The huft_build function in inflate.c in gzip before 1.3.13 creates a hufts (aka huffman) table that is too small, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash or infinite loop) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted archive.  NOTE: this issue is caused by a CVE-2006-4334 regression.
