- Published: 2009-11-10T19:30:00

- Modified: 2009-11-17T07:02:00

Help Viewer in Apple Mac OS X before 10.6.2 does not use an HTTPS connection to retrieve Apple Help content from a web site, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to send a crafted help:runscript link, and thereby execute arbitrary code, via a spoofed response. Per: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3937

    *

      Help Viewer

      CVE-ID: CVE-2009-2808

      Available for: Mac OS X v10.5.8, Mac OS X Server v10.5.8, Mac OS X v10.6 and v10.6.1, Mac OS X Server v10.6 and v10.6.1

      Impact: Using Help Viewer on an untrusted network may result in arbitrary code execution

      Description: Help Viewer does not use HTTPS for viewing remote Apple Help content. A user on the local network may send spoofed HTTP responses containing malicious help:runscript links. This update addresses the issue by using HTTPS when requesting remote Apple Help content. Credit to Brian Mastenbrook for reporting this issue.
