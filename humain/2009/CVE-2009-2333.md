# CVE-2009-2333

Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in CMS Chainuk 1.2 and earlier allow remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in (1) the menu parameter to admin/admin_menu.php, and the id parameter to (2) index.php and (3) admin/admin_edit.php; and (4) delete arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the id parameter to admin/admin_delete.php.  NOTE: vector 2 can be leveraged for static code injection by sending a crafted menu parameter to admin/admin_menu.php, and then sending an id=../menu.csv request to index.php.
