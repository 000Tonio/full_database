Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in src/Task.cc in the FastCGI program in IIPImage Server before 0.9.8 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors associated with crafted arguments to the (1) RGN::run, (2) JTLS::run, or (3) SHD::run function.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
