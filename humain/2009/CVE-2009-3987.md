# CVE-2009-3987

The GeckoActiveXObject function in Mozilla Firefox before 3.0.16 and 3.5.x before 3.5.6, and SeaMonkey before 2.0.1, generates different exception messages depending on whether the referenced COM object is listed in the registry, which allows remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information about installed software by making multiple calls that specify the ProgID values of different COM objects.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
