# CVE-2009-1844

- Published: 2009-06-01T14:30:00

- Modified: 2009-06-08T05:27:00

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Drupal 5.x before 5.18 and 6.x before 6.12 allow (1) remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via crafted UTF-8 byte sequences that are treated as UTF-7 by Internet Explorer 6 and 7, which are not properly handled in the "HTML exports of books" feature; and (2) allow remote authenticated users with administer taxonomy permissions to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the help text of an arbitrary vocabulary.  NOTE: vector 1 exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2009-1575.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
