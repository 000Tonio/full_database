# CVE-2009-1238

- Published: 2009-04-02T17:30:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:34:00

Race condition in the HFS vfs sysctl interface in XNU 1228.8.20 and earlier on Apple Mac OS X 10.5.6 and earlier allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel memory corruption) by simultaneously executing the same HFS_SET_PKG_EXTENSIONS code path in multiple threads, which is problematic because of lack of mutex locking for an unspecified global variable.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**
