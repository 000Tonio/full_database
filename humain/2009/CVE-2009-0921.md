Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in OvCgi/Toolbar.exe in HP OpenView Network Node Manager (OV NNM) 7.01, 7.51, and 7.53 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a long OvAcceptLang cookie, which triggers the error in ov.dll and ovwww.dll, or (2) a long Accept-Language HTTP header, which triggers the error in ovwww.dll or libovwww.so.4.
