- Published: 2009-03-14T18:30:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:33:00

The ntlm_challenge function in the NTLM SASL authentication mechanism in camel/camel-sasl-ntlm.c in Camel in Evolution Data Server (aka evolution-data-server) 2.24.5 and earlier, and 2.25.92 and earlier 2.25.x versions, does not validate whether a certain length value is consistent with the amount of data in a challenge packet, which allows remote mail servers to read information from the process memory of a client, or cause a denial of service (client crash), via an NTLM authentication type 2 packet with a length value that exceeds the amount of packet data.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
