# CVE-2009-4295

- Published: 2009-12-11T16:30:00

- Modified: 2009-12-14T05:00:00

Sun Ray Server Software 4.0 and 4.1 does not generate a unique DSA private key for the firmware on each Sun Ray 1, 1g, 100, and 150 DTU device, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by predicting a key and then using it to decrypt sniffed network traffic.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
