The __inet6_check_established function in net/ipv6/inet6_hashtables.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.29, when Network Namespace Support (aka NET_NS) is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via vectors involving IPv6 packets.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
