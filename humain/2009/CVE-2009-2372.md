Drupal 6.x before 6.13 does not prevent users from modifying user signatures after the associated comment format has been changed to an administrator-controlled input format, which allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script, HTML, and possibly PHP code via a crafted user signature.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
