# CVE-2009-2694

- Published: 2009-08-21T11:02:00

- Modified: 2017-09-19T01:29:00

The msn_slplink_process_msg function in libpurple/protocols/msn/slplink.c in libpurple, as used in Pidgin (formerly Gaim) before 2.5.9 and Adium 1.3.5 and earlier, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) by sending multiple crafted SLP (aka MSNSLP) messages to trigger an overwrite of an arbitrary memory location.  NOTE: this issue reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2009-1376.
