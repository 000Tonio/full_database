Directory traversal vulnerability in index.php in Awesome PHP Mega File Manager 1.0 allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the page parameter.  NOTE: in some environments, this can be leveraged for remote file inclusion by using a UNC share pathname or an ftp, ftps, or ssh2.sftp URL.
