# CVE-2009-0758

- Published: 2009-03-03T16:30:00

- Modified: 2010-08-12T14:13:00

The originates_from_local_legacy_unicast_socket function in avahi-core/server.c in avahi-daemon 0.6.23 does not account for the network byte order of a port number when processing incoming multicast packets, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (network bandwidth and CPU consumption) via a crafted legacy unicast mDNS query packet that triggers a multicast packet storm.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
