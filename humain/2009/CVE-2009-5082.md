# CVE-2009-5082

- Published: 2011-06-30T15:55:00

- Modified: 2011-07-12T04:00:00

The (1) configure and (2) config.guess scripts in GNU troff (aka groff) 1.20.1 on Openwall GNU/*/Linux (aka Owl) improperly create temporary files upon a failure of the mktemp function, which makes it easier for local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a temporary file.

### CVSS Score: **3.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |
