Unspecified vulnerability in the udp subsystem in the kernel in Sun Solaris 10, and OpenSolaris snv_90 through snv_108, when Solaris Trusted Extensions is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) via unspecified vectors involving the crgetlabel function, related to a "TX panic." NOTE: this issue exists because of a regression in earlier kernel patches.
