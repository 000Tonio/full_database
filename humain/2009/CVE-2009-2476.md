# CVE-2009-2476

- Published: 2009-08-10T18:30:00

- Modified: 2017-09-19T01:29:00

The Java Management Extensions (JMX) implementation in Sun Java SE 6 before Update 15, and OpenJDK, does not properly enforce OpenType checks, which allows context-dependent attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging finalizer resurrection to obtain a reference to a privileged object.

### CVSS Score: **10**
