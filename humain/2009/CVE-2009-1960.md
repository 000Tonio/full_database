inc/init.php in DokuWiki 2009-02-14, rc2009-02-06, and rc2009-01-30, when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via the config_cascade[main][default][] parameter to doku.php.  NOTE: PHP remote file inclusion is also possible in PHP 5 using ftp:// URLs.
