# CVE-2009-1754

- Published: 2009-05-26T15:30:00

- Modified: 2012-02-29T05:00:00

The PackageManagerService class in services/java/com/android/server/PackageManagerService.java in Android 1.5 through 1.5 CRB42 does not properly check developer certificates during processing of sharedUserId requests at an application's installation time, which allows remote user-assisted attackers to access application data by creating a package that specifies a shared user ID with an arbitrary application.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
