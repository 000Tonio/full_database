The getSVGDocument method in Google Chrome before 3.0.195.21 omits an unspecified "access check," which allows remote web servers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and conduct cross-site scripting attacks via unknown vectors, related to a user's visit to a different web server that hosts an SVG document.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
