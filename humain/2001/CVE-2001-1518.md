# CVE-2001-1518

- Published: 2001-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2019-04-30T14:27:00

RunAs (runas.exe) in Windows 2000 only creates one session instance at a time, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (RunAs hang) by creating a named pipe session with the authentication server without any request for service.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this vulnerability, however the vendor also presents a scenario in which other users could be affected if running on a Terminal Server. Therefore this is a vulnerability.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
