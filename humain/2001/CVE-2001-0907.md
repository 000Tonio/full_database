Linux kernel 2.2.1 through 2.2.19, and 2.4.1 through 2.4.10, allows local users to cause a denial of service via a series of deeply nested symlinks, which causes the kernel to spend extra time when trying to access the link.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
