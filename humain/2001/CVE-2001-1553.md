# CVE-2001-1553

- Published: 2001-12-31T05:00:00

Buffer overflow in setiathome for SETI@home 3.03, if installed setuid, could allow local users to execute arbitrary code via long command line options (1) socks_server, (2) socks_user, and (3) socks_passwd. NOTE: since the default configuration of setiathome is not setuid, perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.
