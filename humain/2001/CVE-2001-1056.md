IRC DCC helper in the ip_masq_irc IP masquerading module 2.2 allows remote attackers to bypass intended firewall restrictions by causing the target system to send a "DCC SEND" request to a malicious server which listens on port 6667, which may cause the module to believe that the traffic is a valid request and allow the connection to the port specified in the DCC SEND request.
