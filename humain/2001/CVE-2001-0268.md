The i386_set_ldt system call in NetBSD 1.5 and earlier, and OpenBSD 2.8 and earlier, when the USER_LDT kernel option is enabled, does not validate a call gate target, which allows local users to gain root privileges by creating a segment call gate in the Local Descriptor Table (LDT) with a target that specifies an arbitrary kernel address.
