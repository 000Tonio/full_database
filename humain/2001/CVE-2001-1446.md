Find-By-Content in Mac OS X 10.0 through 10.0.4 creates world-readable index files named .FBCIndex in every directory, which allows remote attackers to learn the contents of files in web accessible directories. It is reported that this issue is addressed in the Apple Mac OS X and Mac OS X Server release versions 10.2 and above. This is not confirmed.
