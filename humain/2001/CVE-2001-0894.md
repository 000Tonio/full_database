Vulnerability in Postfix SMTP server before 20010228-pl07, when configured to email the postmaster when SMTP errors cause the session to terminate, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion) by generating a large number of SMTP errors, which forces the SMTP session log to grow too large.
