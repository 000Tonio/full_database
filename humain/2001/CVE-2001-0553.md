SSH Secure Shell 3.0.0 on Unix systems does not properly perform password authentication to the sshd2 daemon, which allows local users to gain access to accounts with short password fields, such as locked accounts that use "NP" in the password field.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| --- | --- | --- |
