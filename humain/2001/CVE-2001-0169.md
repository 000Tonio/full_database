# CVE-2001-0169

- Published: 2001-03-26T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-10-10T01:29:00

When using the LD_PRELOAD environmental variable in SUID or SGID applications, glibc does not verify that preloaded libraries in /etc/ld.so.cache are also SUID/SGID, which could allow a local user to overwrite arbitrary files by loading a library from /lib or /usr/lib.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
