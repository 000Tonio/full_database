# CVE-2001-1032

admin.php in PHP-Nuke 5.2 and earlier, except 5.0RC1, does not check login credentials for upload operations, which allows remote attackers to copy and upload arbitrary files and read the PHP-Nuke configuration file by directly calling admin.php with an upload parameter and specifying the file to copy.
