The ICMP path MTU (PMTU) discovery feature in various UNIX systems allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by spoofing "ICMP Fragmentation needed but Don't Fragment (DF) set" packets between two target hosts, which could cause one host to lower its MTU when transmitting to the other host.
