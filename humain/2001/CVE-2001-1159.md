# CVE-2001-1159

- Published: 2001-07-02T04:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T20:25:00

load_prefs.php and supporting include files in SquirrelMail 1.0.4 and earlier do not properly initialize certain PHP variables, which allows remote attackers to (1) view sensitive files via the config_php and data_dir options, and (2) execute arbitrary code by using options_order.php to upload a message that could be interpreted as PHP.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
