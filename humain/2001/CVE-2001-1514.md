ColdFusion 4.5 and 5, when running on Windows with the advanced security sandbox type set to "operating system," does not properly pass security context to (1) child processes created with <CFEXECUTE> and (2) child processes that call the CreateProcess function and are executed with <CFOBJECT> or end with the CFX extension, which allows attackers to execute programs with the permissions of the System account.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
