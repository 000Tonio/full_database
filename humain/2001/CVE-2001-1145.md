# CVE-2001-1145

- Published: 2001-08-17T04:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-10T19:09:00

fts routines in FreeBSD 4.3 and earlier, NetBSD before 1.5.2, and OpenBSD 2.9 and earlier can be forced to change (chdir) into a different directory than intended when the directory above the current directory is moved, which could cause scripts to perform dangerous actions on the wrong directories.

### CVSS Score: **6.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
