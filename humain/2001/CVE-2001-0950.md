# CVE-2001-0950

- Published: 2001-12-04T05:00:00

ValiCert Enterprise Validation Authority (EVA) Administration Server 3.3 through 4.2.1 uses insufficiently random data to (1) generate session tokens for HSMs using the C rand function, or (2) generate certificates or keys using /dev/urandom instead of another source which blocks when the entropy pool is low, which could make it easier for local or remote attackers to steal tokens or certificates via brute force guessing.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
