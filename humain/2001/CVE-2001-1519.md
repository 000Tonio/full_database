** DISPUTED ** RunAs (runas.exe) in Windows 2000 allows local users to create a spoofed named pipe when the service is stopped, then capture cleartext usernames and passwords when clients connect to the service.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, saying that administrative privileges are already required to exploit it.
