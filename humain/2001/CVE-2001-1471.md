# CVE-2001-1471

- Published: 2001-07-31T04:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:29:00

prefs.php in phpBB 1.4.0 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary PHP code via an invalid language value, which prevents the variables (1) $l_statsblock in prefs.php or (2) $l_privnotify in auth.php from being properly initialized, which can be modified by the user and later used in an eval statement.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
