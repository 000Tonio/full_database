# CVE-2001-0310

- Published: 2001-06-02T04:00:00

- Modified: 2017-10-10T01:29:00

sort in FreeBSD 4.1.1 and earlier, and possibly other operating systems, uses predictable temporary file names and does not properly handle when the temporary file already exists, which causes sort to crash and possibly impacts security-sensitive scripts.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
