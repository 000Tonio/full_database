An issue was discovered in Observium Professional, Enterprise & Community 20.8.10631. It is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to the fact that it is possible to inject and store malicious JavaScript code within it. This can occur via la_id to the /syslog_rules URI for delete_syslog_rule, because of syslog_rules.inc.php.
