# CVE-2020-12272

- Published: 2020-04-27T14:15:00

- Modified: 2022-11-16T03:20:00

OpenDMARC through 1.3.2 and 1.4.x allows attacks that inject authentication results to provide false information about the domain that originated an e-mail message. This is caused by incorrect parsing and interpretation of SPF/DKIM authentication results, as demonstrated by the example.net(.example.com substring.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
