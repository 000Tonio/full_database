A vulnerability in the support tunnel feature of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access the shell of an affected device even though expert mode is disabled. The vulnerability is due to improper configuration of the support tunnel feature. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by enabling the support tunnel, setting a key, and deriving the tunnel password. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run any system command with root access on an affected device.
