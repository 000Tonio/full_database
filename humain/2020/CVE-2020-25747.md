The Telnet service of Rubetek RV-3406, RV-3409, and RV-3411 cameras (firmware versions v342, v339) can allow a remote attacker to gain access to RTSP and ONFIV services without authentication. Thus, the attacker can watch live streams from the camera, rotate the camera, change some settings (brightness, clarity, time), restart the camera, or reset it to factory settings.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | COMPLETE |
