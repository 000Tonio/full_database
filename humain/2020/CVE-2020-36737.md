# CVE-2020-36737

- Published: 2023-07-01T04:15:00

- Modified: 2023-07-01T04:15:00

The Import / Export Customizer Settings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the astra_admin_errors() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to display an import status via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

### CVSS Score: **null**
