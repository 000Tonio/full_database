Critical services for operation can be terminated from windows task manager, bringing the manipulator to a halt. After this a Re-Calibration of the brakes needs to be performed. Be noted that this only can be accomplished either by a Kuka technician or by Kuka issued calibration hardware that interfaces with the manipulator furthering the delay and increasing operational costs.
