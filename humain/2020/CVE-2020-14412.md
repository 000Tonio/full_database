# CVE-2020-14412

NeDi 1.9C is vulnerable to Remote Command Execution. System-Snapshot.php improperly escapes shell metacharacters from a POST request. An attacker can exploit this by crafting an arbitrary payload (any system commands) that contains shell metacharacters via a POST request with a psw parameter. (This can also be exploited via CSRF.)

### CVSS Score: **9**
