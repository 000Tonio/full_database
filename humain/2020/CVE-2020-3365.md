- Published: 2020-09-04T03:15:00

A vulnerability in the directory permissions of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a directory traversal attack on a limited set of restricted directories. The vulnerability is due to a flaw in the logic that governs directory permissions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using capabilities that are not controlled by the role-based access control (RBAC) mechanisms of the software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite files on an affected device.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
