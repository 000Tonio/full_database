# CVE-2020-9725

Adobe FrameMaker version 2019.0.6 (and earlier versions) lacks proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. This could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must open a malicious FrameMaker file.
