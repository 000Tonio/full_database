Certain NETGEAR devices are affected by lack of access control at the function level. This affects JGS516PE before 2.6.0.48, GS116Ev2 before 2.6.0.48, JGS524Ev2 before 2.6.0.48, and JGS524PE before 2.6.0.48. The NSDP protocol version allows unauthenticated remote attackers to obtain all the switch configuration parameters by sending the corresponding read requests.
