An issue was discovered in Flask-CORS (aka CORS Middleware for Flask) before 3.0.9. It allows ../ directory traversal to access private resources because resource matching does not ensure that pathnames are in a canonical format.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
