On Juniper Networks SRX Series and NFX Series, a local authenticated user with access to the shell may obtain the Web API service private key that is used to provide encrypted communication between the Juniper device and the authenticator services. Exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to decrypt the communications between the Juniper device and the authenticator service. This Web API service is used for authentication services such as the Juniper Identity Management Service, used to obtain user identity for Integrated User Firewall feature, or the integrated ClearPass authentication and enforcement feature. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on Networks SRX Series and NFX Series: 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D105; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D190; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7-S8; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R3-S4; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S8; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S11, 17.4R3; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S7; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R2-S4, 18.3R3; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S7, 18.4R2; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S4, 19.2R2.
