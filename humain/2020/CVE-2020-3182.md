A vulnerability in the multicast DNS (mDNS) protocol configuration of Cisco Webex Meetings Client for MacOS could allow an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to obtain sensitive information about the device on which the Webex client is running. The vulnerability exists because sensitive information is included in the mDNS reply. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by doing an mDNS query for a particular service against an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive information.
