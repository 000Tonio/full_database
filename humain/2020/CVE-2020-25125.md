# CVE-2020-25125

- Published: 2020-09-03T18:15:00

GnuPG 2.2.21 and 2.2.22 (and Gpg4win 3.1.12) has an array overflow, leading to a crash or possibly unspecified other impact, when a victim imports an attacker's OpenPGP key, and this key has AEAD preferences. The overflow is caused by a g10/key-check.c error. NOTE: GnuPG 2.3.x is unaffected. GnuPG 2.2.23 is a fixed version.
