** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** The 'id' parameter of IBM Tivoli Storage Manager Version 5 Release 2 (Command Line Administrative Interface, dsmadmc.exe) is vulnerable to an exploitable stack buffer overflow. Note: the vulnerability can be exploited when it is used in "interactive" mode while, cause of a max number characters limitation, it cannot be exploited in batch or command line usage (e.g. dsmadmc.exe -id=username -password=pwd). NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.
