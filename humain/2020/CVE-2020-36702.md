The Ultimate Addons for Gutenberg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authenticated Settings Change in versions up to, and including, 1.14.7. This is due to missing capability checks on several AJAX actions. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber+ roles to update the plugin's settings.
