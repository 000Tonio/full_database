CodeMeter (All versions prior to 6.90 when using CmActLicense update files with CmActLicense Firm Code) has an issue in the license-file signature checking mechanism, which allows attackers to build arbitrary license files, including forging a valid license file as if it were a valid license file of an existing vendor. Only CmActLicense update files with CmActLicense Firm Code are affected.
