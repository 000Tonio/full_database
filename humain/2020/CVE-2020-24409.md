Adobe Illustrator version 24.2 (and earlier) is affected by an out-of-bounds read vulnerability when parsing crafted PDF files. This could result in a read past the end of an allocated memory structure, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. This vulnerability requires user interaction to exploit.
