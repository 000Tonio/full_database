A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Meetings and Cisco Webex Meetings Server could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to maintain bidirectional audio despite being expelled from an active Webex session. The vulnerability is due to a synchronization issue between meeting and media services on a vulnerable Webex site. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to a vulnerable Cisco Webex Meetings or Cisco Webex Meetings Server site. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to maintain the audio connection of a Webex session despite being expelled.
