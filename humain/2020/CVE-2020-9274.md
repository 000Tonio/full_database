An issue was discovered in Pure-FTPd 1.0.49. An uninitialized pointer vulnerability has been detected in the diraliases linked list. When the *lookup_alias(const char alias) or print_aliases(void) function is called, they fail to correctly detect the end of the linked list and try to access a non-existent list member. This is related to init_aliases in diraliases.c.
