An issue was discovered on Mofi Network MOFI4500-4GXeLTE 4.0.8-std devices. A format error in /etc/shadow, coupled with a logic bug in the LuCI - OpenWrt Configuration Interface framework, allows the undocumented system account mofidev to login to the cgi-bin/luci/quick/wizard management interface without a password by abusing a forgotten-password feature.
