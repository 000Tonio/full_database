The Magic Home Pro application 1.5.1 for Android allows Authentication Bypass. The security control that the application currently has in place is a simple Username and Password authentication function. Using enumeration, an attacker is able to forge a User specific token without the need for correct password to gain access to the mobile application as that victim user.

### CVSS Score: **5**
