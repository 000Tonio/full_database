# CVE-2020-7040

- Published: 2020-01-21T21:15:00

- Modified: 2023-01-27T15:17:00

storeBackup.pl in storeBackup through 3.5 relies on the /tmp/storeBackup.lock pathname, which allows symlink attacks that possibly lead to privilege escalation. (Local users can also create a plain file named /tmp/storeBackup.lock to block use of storeBackup until an admin manually deletes that file.)
