In SonarQube 8.4.2.36762, an external attacker can achieve authentication bypass through SonarScanner. With an empty value for the -D sonar.login option, anonymous authentication is forced. This allows creating and overwriting public and private projects via the /api/ce/submit endpoint.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
