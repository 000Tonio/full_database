VMware Horizon Client for Windows (5.x before 5.5.0) contains a denial-of-service vulnerability due to a file system access control issue during install time. Successful exploitation of this issue may allow an attacker to overwrite certain admin privileged files through a symbolic link attack at install time. This will result into a denial-of-service condition on the machine where Horizon Client for Windows is installed.
