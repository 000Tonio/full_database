- Published: 2020-06-18T14:15:00

- Modified: 2020-06-29T18:18:00

Convos before 4.20 does not properly generate a random secret in Core/Settings.pm and Util.pm. This leads to a predictable CONVOS_LOCAL_SECRET value, affecting password resets and invitations.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
