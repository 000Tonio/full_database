An issue was discovered in qemuDomainGetStatsIOThread in qemu/qemu_driver.c in libvirt 4.10.0 though 6.x before 6.1.0. A memory leak was found in the virDomainListGetStats libvirt API that is responsible for retrieving domain statistics when managing QEMU guests. This flaw allows unprivileged users with a read-only connection to cause a memory leak in the domstats command, resulting in a potential denial of service.
