In EVPN VxLAN setups in Arista EOS, specific malformed packets can lead to incorrect MAC to IP bindings and as a result packets can be incorrectly forwarded across VLAN boundaries. This can result in traffic being discarded on the receiving VLAN. This affects versions: 4.21.12M and below releases in the 4.21.x train; 4.22.7M and below releases in the 4.22.x train; 4.23.5M and below releases in the 4.23.x train; 4.24.2F and below releases in the 4.24.x train.
