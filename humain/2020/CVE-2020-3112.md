A vulnerability in the REST API endpoint of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges on the application. The vulnerability is due to insufficient access control validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating with a low-privilege account and sending a crafted request to the API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to interact with the API with administrative privileges.
