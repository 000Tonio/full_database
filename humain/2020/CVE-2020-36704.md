# CVE-2020-36704

- Published: 2023-06-07T02:15:00

The Fruitful Theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters stored via the fruitful_theme_options_action AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 3.8.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
