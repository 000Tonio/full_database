The Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) controller implementation in Espressif ESP-IDF 4.2 and earlier (for ESP32 devices) does not properly restrict the channel map field of the connection request packet on reception, allowing attackers in radio range to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted packet.

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
