HUAWEI Mate 20 Pro smartphones versions earlier than 10.0.0.175(C00E69R3P8) have an improper authentication vulnerability. The software does not sufficiently validate the name of apk file in a special condition which could allow an attacker to forge a crafted application as a normal one. Successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass digital balance function.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
