- Published: 2022-02-24T19:15:00

- Modified: 2022-03-04T16:58:00

A local, authenticated attacker could use an XML External Entity (XXE) attack to exploit weakly configured XML files to access local or remote content. A successful exploit could potentially cause a denial-of-service condition and allow the attacker to arbitrarily read any local file via system-level services.

### CVSS Score: **5.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | PARTIAL |
