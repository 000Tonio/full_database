A flaw was found in the way Samba, as an Active Directory Domain Controller, implemented Kerberos name-based authentication. The Samba AD DC, could become confused about the user a ticket represents if it did not strictly require a Kerberos PAC and always use the SIDs found within. The result could include total domain compromise.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
