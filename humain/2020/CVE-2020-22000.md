HomeAutomation 3.3.2 suffers from an authenticated OS command execution vulnerability using custom command v0.1 plugin. This can be exploited with a CSRF vulnerability to execute arbitrary shell commands as the web user via the 'set_command_on' and 'set_command_off' POST parameters in '/system/systemplugins/customcommand/customcommand.plugin.php' by using an unsanitized PHP exec() function.

### CVSS Score: **8.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
