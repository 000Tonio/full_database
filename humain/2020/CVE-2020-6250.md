SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise, version 16.0, allows an authenticated attacker to exploit certain misconfigured endpoints exposed over the adjacent network, to read system administrator password leading to Information Disclosure. This could help the attacker to read/write any data and even stop the server like an administrator.

### CVSS Score: **6.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | COMPLETE |
