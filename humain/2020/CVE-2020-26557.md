Mesh Provisioning in the Bluetooth Mesh profile 1.0 and 1.0.1 may permit a nearby device (without possession of the AuthValue used in the provisioning protocol) to determine the AuthValue via a brute-force attack (unless the AuthValue is sufficiently random and changed each time).

### CVSS Score: **2.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
