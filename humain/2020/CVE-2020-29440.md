- Modified: 2020-12-04T19:30:00

Tesla Model X vehicles before 2020-11-23 do not perform certificate validation during an attempt to pair a new key fob with the body control module (BCM). This allows an attacker (who is inside a vehicle, or is otherwise able to send data over the CAN bus) to start and drive the vehicle with a spoofed key fob.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
