Macrium Reflect includes an OpenSSL component that specifies an OPENSSLDIR variable as C:\openssl\. Macrium Reflect contains a privileged service that uses this OpenSSL component. Because unprivileged Windows users can create subdirectories off of the system root, a user can create the appropriate path to a specially-crafted openssl.cnf file to achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.
