A vulnerability has been identified in Desigo Insight (All versions). The device does not properly set the X-Frame-Options HTTP Header which makes it vulnerable to Clickjacking attacks. This could allow an unauthenticated attacker to retrieve or modify data in the context of a legitimate user by tricking that user to click on a website controlled by the attacker.
