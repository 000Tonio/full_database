ZTE E8810/E8820/E8822 series routers have an information leak vulnerability, which is caused by hard-coded MQTT service access credentials on the device. The remote attacker could use this credential to connect to the MQTT server, so as to obtain information about other devices by sending specific topics. This affects:<ZXHN E8810, ZXHN E8820, ZXHN E8822><E8810 V1.0.26, E8810 V2.0.1, E8820 V1.1.3L, E8820 V2.0.13, E8822 V2.0.13>
