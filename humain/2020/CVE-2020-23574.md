When uploading a file in Sysax Multi Server 6.90, an authenticated user can modify the filename="" parameter in the uploadfile_name1.htm form to a length of 368 or more bytes. This will create a buffer overflow condition, causing the application to crash.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
