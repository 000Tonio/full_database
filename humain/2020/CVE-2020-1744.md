A flaw was found in keycloak before version 9.0.1. When configuring an Conditional OTP Authentication Flow as a post login flow of an IDP, the failure login events for OTP are not being sent to the brute force protection event queue. So BruteForceProtector does not handle this events.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
