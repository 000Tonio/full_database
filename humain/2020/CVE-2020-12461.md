# CVE-2020-12461

PHP-Fusion 9.03.50 allows SQL Injection because maincore.php has an insufficient protection mechanism. An attacker can develop a crafted payload that can be inserted into the sort_order GET parameter on the members.php members search page. This parameter allows for control over anything after the ORDER BY clause in the SQL query.
