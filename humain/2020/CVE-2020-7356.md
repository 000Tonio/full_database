CAYIN xPost suffers from an unauthenticated SQL Injection vulnerability. Input passed via the GET parameter 'wayfinder_seqid' in wayfinder_meeting_input.jsp is not properly sanitized before being returned to the user or used in SQL queries. This can be exploited to manipulate SQL queries by injecting arbitrary SQL code and execute SYSTEM commands.
