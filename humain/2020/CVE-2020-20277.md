There are multiple unauthenticated directory traversal vulnerabilities in different FTP commands in uftpd FTP server versions 2.7 to 2.10 due to improper implementation of a chroot jail in common.c's compose_abspath function that can be abused to read or write to arbitrary files on the filesystem, leak process memory, or potentially lead to remote code execution.
