# CVE-2020-36658

- Published: 2023-01-27T05:15:00

In Apache::Session::LDAP before 0.5, validity of the X.509 certificate is not checked by default when connecting to remote LDAP backends, because the default configuration of the Net::LDAPS module for Perl is used. NOTE: this can, for example, be fixed in conjunction with the CVE-2020-16093 fix.
