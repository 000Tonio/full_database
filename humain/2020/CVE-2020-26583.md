An issue was discovered in Sage DPW 2020_06_x before 2020_06_002. It allows unauthenticated users to upload JavaScript (in a file) via the expenses claiming functionality. However, to view the file, authentication is required. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can persistently include arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the affected web page. The vulnerability can be used to change the contents of the displayed site, redirect to other sites, or steal user credentials. Additionally, users are potential victims of browser exploits and JavaScript malware.
