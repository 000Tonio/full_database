# CVE-2020-19861

- Published: 2022-01-21T15:15:00

When a zone file in ldns 1.7.1 is parsed, the function ldns_nsec3_salt_data is too trusted for the length value obtained from the zone file. When the memcpy is copied, the 0xfe - ldns_rdf_size(salt_rdf) byte data can be copied, causing heap overflow information leakage.

### CVSS Score: **5**
