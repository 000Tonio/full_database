# CVE-2020-24606

- Published: 2020-08-24T18:15:00

Squid before 4.13 and 5.x before 5.0.4 allows a trusted peer to perform Denial of Service by consuming all available CPU cycles during handling of a crafted Cache Digest response message. This only occurs when cache_peer is used with the cache digests feature. The problem exists because peerDigestHandleReply() livelocking in peer_digest.cc mishandles EOF.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
