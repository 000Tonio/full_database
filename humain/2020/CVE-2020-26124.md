# CVE-2020-26124

- Published: 2020-10-02T09:15:00

- Modified: 2022-01-06T14:18:00

openmediavault before 4.1.36 and 5.x before 5.5.12 allows authenticated PHP code injection attacks, via the sortfield POST parameter of rpc.php, because json_encode_safe is not used in config/databasebackend.inc. Successful exploitation allows arbitrary command execution on the underlying operating system as root.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
