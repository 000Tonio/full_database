# CVE-2020-15256

A prototype pollution vulnerability has been found in `object-path` <= 0.11.4 affecting the `set()` method. The vulnerability is limited to the `includeInheritedProps` mode (if version >= 0.11.0 is used), which has to be explicitly enabled by creating a new instance of `object-path` and setting the option `includeInheritedProps: true`, or by using the default `withInheritedProps` instance. The default operating mode is not affected by the vulnerability if version >= 0.11.0 is used. Any usage of `set()` in versions < 0.11.0 is vulnerable. The issue is fixed in object-path version 0.11.5 As a workaround, don't use the `includeInheritedProps: true` options or the `withInheritedProps` instance if using a version >= 0.11.0.
