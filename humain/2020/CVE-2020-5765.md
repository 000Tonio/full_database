# CVE-2020-5765

- Published: 2020-07-15T13:15:00

Nessus 8.10.0 and earlier were found to contain a Stored XSS vulnerability due to improper validation of input during scan configuration. An authenticated, remote attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code in a user's session. Tenable has implemented additional input validation mechanisms to correct this issue in Nessus 8.11.0.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
