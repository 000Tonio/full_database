In Apache NiFi 1.0.0 to 1.11.4, the NiFi download token (one-time password) mechanism used a fixed cache size and did not authenticate a request to create a download token, only when attempting to use the token to access the content. An unauthenticated user could repeatedly request download tokens, preventing legitimate users from requesting download tokens.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
