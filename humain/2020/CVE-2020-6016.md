# CVE-2020-6016

- Published: 2020-11-18T15:15:00

- Modified: 2022-10-21T19:37:00

Valve's Game Networking Sockets prior to version v1.2.0 improperly handles unreliable segments with negative offsets in function SNP_ReceiveUnreliableSegment(), leading to a Heap-Based Buffer Underflow and a free() of memory not from the heap, resulting in a memory corruption and probably even a remote code execution.
