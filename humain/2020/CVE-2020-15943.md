An issue was discovered in the Gantt-Chart module before 5.5.4 for Jira. Due to a missing privilege check, it is possible to read and write to the module configuration of other users. This can also be used to deliver an XSS payload to other users' dashboards. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to be authenticated.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**
