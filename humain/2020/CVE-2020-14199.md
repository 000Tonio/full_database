BIP-143 in the Bitcoin protocol specification mishandles the signing of a Segwit transaction, which allows attackers to trick a user into making two signatures in certain cases, potentially leading to a huge transaction fee. NOTE: this affects all hardware wallets. It was fixed in 1.9.1 for the Trezor One and 2.3.1 for the Trezor Model T.
