A vulnerability in the hardware crypto driver of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco 4300 Series Integrated Services Routers and Cisco Catalyst 9800-L Wireless Controllers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to disconnect legitimate IPsec VPN sessions to an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient verification of authenticity of received Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by tampering with ESP cleartext values as a man-in-the-middle.
