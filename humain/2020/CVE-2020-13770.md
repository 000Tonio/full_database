# CVE-2020-13770

- Published: 2020-11-12T18:15:00

Several services are accessing named pipes in Ivanti Endpoint Manager through 2020.1.1 with default or overly permissive security attributes; as these services run as user ‘NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM’, the issue can be used to escalate privileges from a local standard or service account having SeImpersonatePrivilege (eg. user ‘NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE’).
