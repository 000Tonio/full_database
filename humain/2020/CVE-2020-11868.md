# CVE-2020-11868

- Published: 2020-04-17T04:15:00

- Modified: 2022-04-26T17:05:00

ntpd in ntp before 4.2.8p14 and 4.3.x before 4.3.100 allows an off-path attacker to block unauthenticated synchronization via a server mode packet with a spoofed source IP address, because transmissions are rescheduled even when a packet lacks a valid origin timestamp.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
