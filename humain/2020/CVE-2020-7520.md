A CWE-601: URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') vulnerability exists in Schneider Electric Software Update (SESU), V2.4.0 and prior, which could cause execution of malicious code on the victim's machine. In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker requires privileged access on the engineering workstation to modify a Windows registry key which would divert all traffic updates to go through a server in the attacker's possession. A man-in-the-middle attack is then used to complete the exploit.
