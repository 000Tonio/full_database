** DISPUTED ** In OpenWrt LuCI git-20.x, remote unauthenticated attackers can retrieve the list of installed packages and services. NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this report because, for instances reachable by an unauthenticated actor, the same information is available in other (more complex) ways, and there is no plan to restrict the information further.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
