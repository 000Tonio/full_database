RSA Authentication Manager versions prior to 8.4 P10 contain a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Security Console. A malicious RSA Authentication Manager Security Console administrator with advanced privileges could exploit this vulnerability to store arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code through the Security Console web interface. When other Security Console administrators open the affected report page, the injected scripts could potentially be executed in their browser.
