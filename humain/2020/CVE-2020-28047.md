AudimexEE before 14.1.1 is vulnerable to Reflected XSS (Cross-Site-Scripting). If the recommended security configuration parameter "unique_error_numbers" is not set, remote attackers can inject arbitrary web script or HTML via 'action, cargo, panel' parameters that can lead to data leakage.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
