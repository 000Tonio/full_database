A vulnerability has been identified in LOGO! 8 BM (incl. SIPLUS variants) (All versions < V8.3), LOGO! Soft Comfort (All versions < V8.3). The LOGO! program files generated and used by the affected components offer the possibility to save user-defined functions (UDF) in a password protected way. This protection is implemented in the software that displays the information. An attacker could reverse engineer the UDFs directly from stored program files.
