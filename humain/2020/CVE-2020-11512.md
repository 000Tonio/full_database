# CVE-2020-11512

Stored XSS in the IMPress for IDX Broker WordPress plugin before 2.6.2 allows authenticated attackers with minimal (subscriber-level) permissions to save arbitrary JavaScript in the plugin's settings panel via the idx_update_recaptcha_key AJAX action and a crafted idx_recaptcha_site_key parameter, which would then be executed in the browser of any administrator visiting the panel. This could be used to create new administrator-level accounts.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
