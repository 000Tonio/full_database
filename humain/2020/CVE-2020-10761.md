An assertion failure issue was found in the Network Block Device(NBD) Server in all QEMU versions before QEMU 5.0.1. This flaw occurs when an nbd-client sends a spec-compliant request that is near the boundary of maximum permitted request length. A remote nbd-client could use this flaw to crash the qemu-nbd server resulting in a denial of service.
