# CVE-2020-26117

- Published: 2020-09-27T04:15:00

- Modified: 2022-11-16T14:13:00

In rfb/CSecurityTLS.cxx and rfb/CSecurityTLS.java in TigerVNC before 1.11.0, viewers mishandle TLS certificate exceptions. They store the certificates as authorities, meaning that the owner of a certificate could impersonate any server after a client had added an exception.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
