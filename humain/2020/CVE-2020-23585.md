A remote attacker can conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on OPTILINK OP-XT71000N Hardware Version: V2.2 , Firmware Version: OP_V3.3.1-191028. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the "mgm_config_file.asp" because of which attacker can create a crafted "csrf form" which sends " malicious xml data" to "/boaform/admin/formMgmConfigUpload". the exploit allows attacker to "gain full privileges" and to "fully compromise of router & network".
