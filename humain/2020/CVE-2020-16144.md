When using an object storage like S3 as the file store, when a user creates a public link to a folder where anonymous users can upload files, and another user uploads a virus the files antivirus app would detect the virus but fails to delete it due to permission issues. This affects the files_antivirus component versions before 0.15.2 for ownCloud.
