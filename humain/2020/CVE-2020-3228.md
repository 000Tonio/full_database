A vulnerability in Security Group Tag Exchange Protocol (SXP) in Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability exists because crafted SXP packets are mishandled. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specifically crafted SXP packets to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition.
