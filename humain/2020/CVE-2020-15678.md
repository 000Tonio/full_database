When recursing through graphical layers while scrolling, an iterator may have become invalid, resulting in a potential use-after-free. This occurs because the function APZCTreeManager::ComputeClippedCompositionBounds did not follow iterator invalidation rules. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 81, Thunderbird < 78.3, and Firefox ESR < 78.3.
