# CVE-2020-25739

- Published: 2020-09-23T14:15:00

- Modified: 2023-01-31T21:14:00

An issue was discovered in the gon gem before gon-6.4.0 for Ruby. MultiJson does not honor the escape_mode parameter to escape fields as an XSS protection mechanism. To mitigate, json_dumper.rb in gon now does escaping for XSS by default without relying on MultiJson.
