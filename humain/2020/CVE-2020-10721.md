A flaw was found in the fabric8-maven-plugin 4.0.0 and later. When using a wildfly-swarm or thorntail custom configuration, a malicious YAML configuration file on the local machine executing the maven plug-in could allow for deserialization of untrusted data resulting in arbitrary code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

### CVSS Score: **6.9**
