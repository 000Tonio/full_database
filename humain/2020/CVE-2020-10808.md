Vesta Control Panel (VestaCP) through 0.9.8-26 allows Command Injection via the schedule/backup Backup Listing Endpoint. The attacker must be able to create a crafted filename on the server, as demonstrated by an FTP session that renames .bash_logout to a .bash_logout' substring followed by shell metacharacters.
