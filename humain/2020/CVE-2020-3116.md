A vulnerability in the way Cisco Webex applications process Universal Communications Format (UCF) files could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of UCF media files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a user a malicious UCF file through a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit would cause the application to quit unexpectedly.
