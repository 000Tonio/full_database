LiveCode v9.6.1 on Windows allows local, low-privileged users to gain privileges by creating a malicious "cmd.exe" in the folder of the vulnerable LiveCode application. If the application is using LiveCode's "shell()" function, it will attempt to search for "cmd.exe" in the folder of the current application and run the malicious "cmd.exe".
