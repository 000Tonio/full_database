The UniFi Video Server (Windows) web interface configuration restore functionality at the “backup” and “wizard” endpoints does not implement sufficient privilege checks. Low privileged users, belonging to the PUBLIC_GROUP or CUSTOM_GROUP groups, can access these endpoints and overwrite the current application configuration. This can be abused for various purposes, including adding new administrative users. Affected Products: UniFi Video Controller v3.9.3 (for Windows 7/8/10 x64) and prior. Fixed in UniFi Video Controller v3.9.6 and newer.
