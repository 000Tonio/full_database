# CVE-2020-24394

- Published: 2020-08-19T13:15:00

- Modified: 2022-10-25T17:03:00

In the Linux kernel before 5.7.8, fs/nfsd/vfs.c (in the NFS server) can set incorrect permissions on new filesystem objects when the filesystem lacks ACL support, aka CID-22cf8419f131. This occurs because the current umask is not considered.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
