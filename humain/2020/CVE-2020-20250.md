Mikrotik RouterOs before stable version 6.47 suffers from a memory corruption vulnerability in the /nova/bin/lcdstat process. An authenticated remote attacker can cause a Denial of Service (NULL pointer dereference). NOTE: this is different from CVE-2020-20253 and CVE-2020-20254. All four vulnerabilities in the /nova/bin/lcdstat process are discussed in the CVE-2020-20250 github.com/cq674350529 reference.
