# CVE-2020-35452

- Published: 2021-06-10T07:15:00

Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.46 A specially crafted Digest nonce can cause a stack overflow in mod_auth_digest. There is no report of this overflow being exploitable, nor the Apache HTTP Server team could create one, though some particular compiler and/or compilation option might make it possible, with limited consequences anyway due to the size (a single byte) and the value (zero byte) of the overflow

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
