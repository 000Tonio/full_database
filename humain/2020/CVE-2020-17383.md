A directory traversal vulnerability on Telos Z/IP One devices through 4.0.0r grants an unauthenticated individual root level access to the device's file system. This can be used to identify configuration settings, password hashes for built-in accounts, and the cleartext password for remote configuration of the device through the WebUI.
