Solstice-Pod up to 5.0.2 WEBRTC server mishandles the format-string specifiers %x; %p; %c and %s in the screen_key, display_name, browser_name, and operation_system parameter during the authentication process. This may crash the server and force Solstice-Pod to reboot, which leads to a denial of service.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
