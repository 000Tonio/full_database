- Published: 2020-09-24T15:15:00

An issue was discovered on Gemtek WRTM-127ACN 01.01.02.141 and WRTM-127x9 01.01.02.127 devices. The Monitor Diagnostic network page allows an authenticated attacker to execute a command directly on the target machine. Commands are executed as the root user (uid 0). (Even if a login is required, most routers are left with default credentials.)

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
