In versions 14.1.0-14.1.0.1 and 14.1.2.5-14.1.2.7, when a BIG-IP object is created or listed through the REST interface, the protected fields are obfuscated in the REST response, not protected via a SecureVault cryptogram as TMSH does. One example of protected fields is the GTM monitor password.

### CVSS Score: **4**
