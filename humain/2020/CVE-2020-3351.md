A vulnerability in Cisco SD-WAN Solution Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of fields in Cisco SD-WAN peering messages that are encapsulated in UDP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted UDP messages to the targeted system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause services on the device to fail, resulting in a DoS condition that could impact the targeted device and other devices that depend on it.
