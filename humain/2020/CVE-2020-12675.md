The mappress-google-maps-for-wordpress plugin before 2.54.6 for WordPress does not correctly implement capability checks for AJAX functions related to creation/retrieval/deletion of PHP template files, leading to Remote Code Execution. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-12077.
