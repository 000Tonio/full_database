# CVE-2020-8277

- Published: 2020-11-19T01:15:00

- Modified: 2022-05-10T15:25:00

A Node.js application that allows an attacker to trigger a DNS request for a host of their choice could trigger a Denial of Service in versions < 15.2.1, < 14.15.1, and < 12.19.1 by getting the application to resolve a DNS record with a larger number of responses. This is fixed in 15.2.1, 14.15.1, and 12.19.1.

### CVSS Score: **5**
