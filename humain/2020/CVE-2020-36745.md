# CVE-2020-36745

- Published: 2023-07-01T05:15:00

- Modified: 2023-07-01T05:15:00

The WP Project Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.4.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the do_updates() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to trigger updates via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
