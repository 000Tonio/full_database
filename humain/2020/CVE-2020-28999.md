An issue was discovered in Apexis Streaming Video Web Application on Geeni GNC-CW013 doorbell 1.8.1 devices. A remote attacker can take full control of the camera with a high-privileged account. The vulnerability exists because a static username and password are compiled into a shared library (libhipcam.so) used to provide the streaming camera service.
