# CVE-2020-15669

- Published: 2020-10-01T19:15:00

When aborting an operation, such as a fetch, an abort signal may be deleted while alerting the objects to be notified. This results in a use-after-free and we presume that with enough effort it could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 68.12 and Thunderbird < 68.12.
