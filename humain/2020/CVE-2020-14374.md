A flaw was found in dpdk in versions before 18.11.10 and before 19.11.5. A flawed bounds checking in the copy_data function leads to a buffer overflow allowing an attacker in a virtual machine to write arbitrary data to any address in the vhost_crypto application. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**
