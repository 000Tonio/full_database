A misconfiguration in Web-Sesame 2020.1.1.3375 allows an unauthenticated attacker to download the source code of the application, facilitating its comprehension (code review). Specifically, JavaScript source maps were inadvertently included in the production Webpack configuration. These maps contain sources used to generate the bundle, configuration settings (e.g., API keys), and developers' comments.
