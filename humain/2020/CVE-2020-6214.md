# CVE-2020-6214

- Published: 2020-04-14T19:15:00

SAP S/4HANA (Financial Products Subledger), version 100, uses an incorrect authorization object in some reports. Although the affected reports are protected with other authorization objects, exploitation of the vulnerability would allow an authenticated attacker to view, change, or delete data, thereby preventing the proper segregation of duties in the system.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
