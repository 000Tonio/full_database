# CVE-2020-7982

- Published: 2020-03-16T22:15:00

- Modified: 2022-04-18T15:15:00

An issue was discovered in OpenWrt 18.06.0 to 18.06.6 and 19.07.0, and LEDE 17.01.0 to 17.01.7. A bug in the fork of the opkg package manager before 2020-01-25 prevents correct parsing of embedded checksums in the signed repository index, allowing a man-in-the-middle attacker to inject arbitrary package payloads (which are installed without verification).
