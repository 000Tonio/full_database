Istio 1.4.x before 1.4.9 and Istio 1.5.x before 1.5.4 contain the following vulnerability when telemetry v2 is enabled: by sending a specially crafted packet, an attacker could trigger a Null Pointer Exception resulting in a Denial of Service. This could be sent to the ingress gateway or a sidecar, triggering a null pointer exception which results in a denial of service. This also affects servicemesh-proxy where a null pointer exception flaw was found in servicemesh-proxy. When running Telemetry v2 (not on by default in version 1.4.x), an attacker could send a specially crafted packet to the ingress gateway or proxy sidecar, triggering a denial of service.
