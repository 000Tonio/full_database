A vulnerability in the software upgrade process of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint Software and Cisco RoomOS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to modify the filesystem to cause a denial of service (DoS) or gain privileged access to the root filesystem. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker with administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability by sending requests with malformed parameters to the system using the console, Secure Shell (SSH), or web API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify the device configuration or cause a DoS.

### CVSS Score: **9**
