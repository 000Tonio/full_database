The hashing algorithm implemented for NSDP password authentication on NETGEAR JGS516PE/GS116Ev2 v2.6.0.43 devices was found to be insecure, allowing attackers (with access to a network capture) to quickly generate multiple collisions to generate valid passwords, or infer some parts of the original.

### CVSS Score: **3.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
