Jaws through 1.8.0 allows remote authenticated administrators to execute arbitrary code via crafted use of admin.php?reqGadget=Components&reqAction=InstallGadget&comp=FileBrowser and admin.php?reqGadget=FileBrowser&reqAction=Files to upload a .php file. NOTE: this is unrelated to the JAWS (aka Job Access With Speech) product.
