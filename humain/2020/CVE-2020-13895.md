# CVE-2020-13895

- Published: 2020-06-07T01:15:00

Crypt::Perl::ECDSA in the Crypt::Perl (aka p5-Crypt-Perl) module before 0.32 for Perl fails to verify correct ECDSA signatures when r and s are small and when s = 1. This happens when using the curve secp256r1 (prime256v1). This could conceivably have a security-relevant impact if an attacker wishes to use public r and s values when guessing whether signature verification will fail.
