Affected versions of Smartstore have a missing WebApi Authentication attribute. This vulnerability affects Smartstore shops in version 4.0.0 & 4.0.1 which have installed and activated the Web API plugin. Users of Smartstore 4.0.0 and 4.0.1 must merge their repository with 4.0.x or overwrite the file SmartStore.Web.Framework in the */bin* directory of the deployed shop with this file. As a workaround without updating uninstall the Web API plugin to close this vulnerability.
