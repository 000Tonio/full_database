# CVE-2020-26168

- Published: 2020-11-09T22:15:00

- Modified: 2020-11-18T20:39:00

The LDAP authentication method in LdapLoginModule in Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise 4.x before 4.0.3, and Jet Enterprise 4.x through 4.2, doesn't verify properly the password in some system-user-dn scenarios. As a result, users (clients/members) can be authenticated even if they provide invalid passwords.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
