A flaw was found in Keycloak before 13.0.0 where an external identity provider, after successful authentication, redirects to a Keycloak endpoint that accepts multiple invocations with the use of the same "state" parameter. This flaw allows a malicious user to perform replay attacks.

### CVSS Score: **4**
