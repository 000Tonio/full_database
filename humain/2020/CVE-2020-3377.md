A vulnerability in the Device Manager application of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands on the affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted arguments to a specific field within the application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to run commands as the administrator on the DCNM.
