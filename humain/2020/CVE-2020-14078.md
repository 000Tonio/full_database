TRENDnet TEW-827DRU devices through 2.06B04 contain a stack-based buffer overflow in the ssi binary. The overflow allows an authenticated user to execute arbitrary code by POSTing to apply.cgi via the action wifi_captive_portal_login with a sufficiently long REMOTE_ADDR key.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
