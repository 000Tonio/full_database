# CVE-2020-26870

- Published: 2020-10-07T16:15:00

- Modified: 2022-04-27T18:49:00

Cure53 DOMPurify before 2.0.17 allows mutation XSS. This occurs because a serialize-parse roundtrip does not necessarily return the original DOM tree, and a namespace can change from HTML to MathML, as demonstrated by nesting of FORM elements.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
