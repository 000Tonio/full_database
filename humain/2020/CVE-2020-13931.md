# CVE-2020-13931

If Apache TomEE 8.0.0-M1 - 8.0.3, 7.1.0 - 7.1.3, 7.0.0-M1 - 7.0.8, 1.0.0 - 1.7.5 is configured to use the embedded ActiveMQ broker, and the broker config is misconfigured, a JMX port is opened on TCP port 1099, which does not include authentication. CVE-2020-11969 previously addressed the creation of the JMX management interface, however the incomplete fix did not cover this edge case.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
