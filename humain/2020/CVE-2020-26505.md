A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the “Marmind” web application with version 4.1.141.0 allows an attacker to inject code that will later be executed by legitimate users when they open the assets containing the JavaScript code. This would allow an attacker to perform unauthorized actions in the application on behalf of legitimate users or spread malware via the application. By using the “Assets Upload” function, an attacker can abuse the upload function to upload a malicious PDF file containing a stored XSS.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
