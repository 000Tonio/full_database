# CVE-2020-14049

- Published: 2020-06-22T18:15:00

Viber for Windows up to 13.2.0.39 does not properly quote its custom URI handler. A malicious website could launch Viber with arbitrary parameters, forcing a victim to send an NTLM authentication request, and either relay the request or capture the hash for offline password cracking. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-12569.
