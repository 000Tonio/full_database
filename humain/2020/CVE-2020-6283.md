# CVE-2020-6283

- Published: 2020-09-09T13:15:00

- Modified: 2020-09-10T01:58:00

SAP Fiori Launchpad does not sufficiently encode user controlled inputs, and hence allowing the attacker to inject the meta tag into the launchpad html using the vulnerable parameter, resulting in reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. With a successful attack, the attacker can steal authentication information of the user, such as data relating to his or her current session.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
