** DISPUTED ** Liferay Portal Server tested on 7.3.5 GA6, 7.2.0 GA1 is affected by OS Command Injection. An administrator user can inject commands through the Gogo Shell module to execute any OS command on the Liferay Portal Sever. NOTE: The developer disputes this as a vulnerability since it is a feature for administrators to access and execute commands in Gogo Shell and therefore not a design flaw
