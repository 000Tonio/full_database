A flaw was found in Ovirt Engine's web interface in ovirt 4.4 and earlier, where it did not filter user-controllable parameters completely, resulting in a reflected cross-site scripting attack. This flaw allows an attacker to leverage a phishing attack, steal an unsuspecting user's cookies or other confidential information, or impersonate them within the application's context.
