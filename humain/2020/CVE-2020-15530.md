# CVE-2020-15530

- Published: 2020-07-05T01:15:00

An issue was discovered in Valve Steam Client 2.10.91.91. The installer allows local users to gain NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges because some parts of %PROGRAMFILES(X86)%\Steam and/or %COMMONPROGRAMFILES(X86)%\Steam have weak permissions during a critical time window. An attacker can make this time window arbitrarily long by using opportunistic locks.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
