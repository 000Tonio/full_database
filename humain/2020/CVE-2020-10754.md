It was found that nmcli, a command line interface to NetworkManager did not honour 802-1x.ca-path and 802-1x.phase2-ca-path settings, when creating a new profile. When a user connects to a network using this profile, the authentication does not happen and the connection is made insecurely.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
