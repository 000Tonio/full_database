# CVE-2020-15953

LibEtPan through 1.9.4, as used in MailCore 2 through 0.6.3 and other products, has a STARTTLS buffering issue that affects IMAP, SMTP, and POP3. When a server sends a "begin TLS" response, the client reads additional data (e.g., from a meddler-in-the-middle attacker) and evaluates it in a TLS context, aka "response injection."

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
