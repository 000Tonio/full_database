# CVE-2020-26891

- Published: 2020-10-19T17:15:00

- Modified: 2020-10-26T21:30:00

AuthRestServlet in Matrix Synapse before 1.21.0 is vulnerable to XSS due to unsafe interpolation of the session GET parameter. This allows a remote attacker to execute an XSS attack on the domain Synapse is hosted on, by supplying the victim user with a malicious URL to the /_matrix/client/r0/auth/*/fallback/web or /_matrix/client/unstable/auth/*/fallback/web Synapse endpoints.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
