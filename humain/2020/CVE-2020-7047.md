The WordPress plugin, WP Database Reset through 3.1, contains a flaw that gave any authenticated user, with minimal permissions, the ability (with a simple wp-admin/admin.php?db-reset-tables[]=users request) to escalate their privileges to administrator while dropping all other users from the table.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
