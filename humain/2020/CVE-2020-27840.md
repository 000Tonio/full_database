A flaw was found in samba. Spaces used in a string around a domain name (DN), while supposed to be ignored, can cause invalid DN strings with spaces to instead write a zero-byte into out-of-bounds memory, resulting in a crash. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
