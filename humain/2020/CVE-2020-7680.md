# CVE-2020-7680

- Published: 2020-07-20T16:15:00

- Modified: 2021-02-24T19:10:00

docsify prior to 4.11.4 is susceptible to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). Docsify.js uses fragment identifiers (parameters after # sign) to load resources from server-side .md files. Due to lack of validation here, it is possible to provide external URLs after the /#/ (domain.com/#//attacker.com) and render arbitrary JavaScript/HTML inside docsify page.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
