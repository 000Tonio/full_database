An issue was discovered in the pricing-table-by-supsystic plugin before 1.8.2 for WordPress. Because there is no permission check on the ImportJSONTable, createFromTpl, and getJSONExportTable endpoints, unauthenticated users can retrieve pricing table information, create new tables, or import/modify a table.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
