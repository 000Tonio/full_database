The QCMAP_Web_CLIENT binary in the Qualcomm QCMAP software suite prior to versions released in October 2020 does not validate the return value of a strstr() or strchr() call in the Tokenizer() function. An attacker who invokes the web interface with a crafted URL can crash the process, causing denial of service. This version of QCMAP is used in many kinds of networking devices, primarily mobile hotspots and LTE routers.
