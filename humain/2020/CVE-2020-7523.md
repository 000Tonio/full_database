Improper Privilege Management vulnerability exists in Schneider Electric Modbus Serial Driver (see security notification for versions) which could cause local privilege escalation when the Modbus Serial Driver service is invoked. The driver does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.
