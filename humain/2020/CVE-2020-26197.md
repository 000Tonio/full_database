Dell PowerScale OneFS 8.1.0 - 9.1.0 contains an LDAP Provider inability to connect over TLSv1.2 vulnerability. It may make it easier to eavesdrop and decrypt such traffic for a malicious actor. Note: This does not affect clusters which are not relying on an LDAP server for the authentication provider.
