# CVE-2020-12725

Havoc Research discovered an authenticated Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via the "JSON" data source of Redash open-source 8.0.0 and prior. Possibly, other connectors are affected. The SSRF is potent and provides a lot of flexibility in terms of being able to craft HTTP requests e.g., by adding headers, selecting any HTTP verb, etc.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |
