# CVE-2020-14158

- Published: 2020-07-30T14:15:00

- Modified: 2020-08-05T14:37:00

The ABUS Secvest FUMO50110 hybrid module does not have any security mechanism that ensures confidentiality or integrity of RF packets that are exchanged with an alarm panel. This makes it easier to conduct wAppLoxx authentication-bypass attacks.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
