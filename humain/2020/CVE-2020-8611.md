In Progress MOVEit Transfer 2019.1 before 2019.1.4 and 2019.2 before 2019.2.1, multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities have been found in the REST API that could allow an authenticated attacker to gain unauthorized access to MOVEit Transfer's database via the REST API. Depending on the database engine being used (MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, or Azure SQL), an attacker may be able to infer information about the structure and contents of the database in addition to executing SQL statements that alter or destroy database elements.
