The installations for ABB System 800xA Information Manager versions 5.1, 6.0 to 6.0.3.2 and 6.1 wrongly contain an auxiliary component. An attacker is able to use this for an XSS-like attack to an authenticated local user, which might lead to execution of arbitrary code.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
