A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to overwrite certain files that should be restricted on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization enforcement on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a file using the REST API. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to overwrite and upload files, which could degrade the functionality of the affected system.
