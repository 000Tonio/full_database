NaviServer 4.99.4 to 4.99.19 allows denial of service due to the nsd/driver.c ChunkedDecode function not properly validating the length of a chunk. A remote attacker can craft a chunked-transfer request that will result in a negative value being passed to memmove via the size parameter, causing the process to crash.

### CVSS Score: **5**
