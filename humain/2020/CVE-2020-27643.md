# CVE-2020-27643

- Published: 2020-12-29T21:15:00

The %PROGRAMDATA%\1E\Client directory in 1E Client 5.0.0.745 and 4.1.0.267 allows remote authenticated users and local users to create and modify files in protected directories (where they would not normally have access to create or modify files) via the creation of a junction point to a system directory. This leads to partial privilege escalation.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
