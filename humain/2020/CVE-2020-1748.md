A flaw was found in all supported versions before wildfly-elytron-1.6.8.Final-redhat-00001, where the WildFlySecurityManager checks were bypassed when using custom security managers, resulting in an improper authorization. This flaw leads to information exposure by unauthenticated access to secure resources.
