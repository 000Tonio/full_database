In Solstice Pod before 3.3.0 (or Open4.3), the Administrator password can be enumerated using brute-force attacks via the /Config/service/initModel?password= Solstice Open Control API because there is no complexity requirement (e.g., it might be all digits or all lowercase letters).

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
