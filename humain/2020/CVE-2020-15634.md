This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR R6700 routers with firmware 1.0.4.84_10.0.58. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of string table file uploads. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied string before using it as a format specifier. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the web server. Was ZDI-CAN-9755.
