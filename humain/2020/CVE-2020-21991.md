AVE DOMINAplus <=1.10.x suffers from an authentication bypass vulnerability due to missing control check when directly calling the autologin GET parameter in changeparams.php script. Setting the autologin value to 1 allows an unauthenticated attacker to permanently disable the authentication security control and access the management interface with admin privileges without providing credentials.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |
