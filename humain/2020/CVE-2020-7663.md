# CVE-2020-7663

- Published: 2020-06-02T19:15:00

- Modified: 2023-01-20T18:22:00

websocket-extensions ruby module prior to 0.1.5 allows Denial of Service (DoS) via Regex Backtracking. The extension parser may take quadratic time when parsing a header containing an unclosed string parameter value whose content is a repeating two-byte sequence of a backslash and some other character. This could be abused by an attacker to conduct Regex Denial Of Service (ReDoS) on a single-threaded server by providing a malicious payload with the Sec-WebSocket-Extensions header.

### CVSS Score: **5**
