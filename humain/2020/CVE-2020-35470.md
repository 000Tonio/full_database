# CVE-2020-35470

- Published: 2020-12-15T01:15:00

Envoy before 1.16.1 logs an incorrect downstream address because it considers only the directly connected peer, not the information in the proxy protocol header. This affects situations with tcp-proxy as the network filter (not HTTP filters).

### CVSS Score: **5.8**
