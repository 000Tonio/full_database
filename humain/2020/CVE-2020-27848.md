dotCMS before 20.10.1 allows SQL injection, as demonstrated by the /api/v1/containers orderby parameter. The PaginatorOrdered classes that are used to paginate results of a REST endpoints do not sanitize the orderBy parameter and in some cases it is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. A user must be an authenticated manager in the dotCMS system to exploit this vulnerability.
