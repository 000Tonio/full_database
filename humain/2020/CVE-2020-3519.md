A vulnerability in a specific REST API method of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a path traversal attack on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the affected device.
