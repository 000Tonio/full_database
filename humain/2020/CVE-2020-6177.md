SAP Mobile Platform, version 3.0, does not sufficiently validate an XML document accepted from an untrusted source which could lead to partial denial of service. Since SAP Mobile Platform does not allow External-Entity resolving, there is no issue of leaking content of files on the server.

### CVSS Score: **4**
