The web interface of Maipu MP1800X-50 7.5.3.14(R) devices allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via the form/formDeviceVerGet URI, such as system id, hardware model, hardware version, bootloader version, software version, software image file, compilation time, and system uptime. This is similar to CVE-2019-1653.
