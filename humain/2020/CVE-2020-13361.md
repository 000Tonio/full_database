In QEMU 5.0.0 and earlier, es1370_transfer_audio in hw/audio/es1370.c does not properly validate the frame count, which allows guest OS users to trigger an out-of-bounds access during an es1370_write() operation.

### CVSS Score: **3.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
