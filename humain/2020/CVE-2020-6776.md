# CVE-2020-6776

- Published: 2021-01-14T16:15:00

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Bosch PRAESIDEO until and including version 4.41 and Bosch PRAESENSA until and including version 1.10 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to trigger actions on an affected system on behalf of another user (Cross-Site Request Forgery). This requires the victim to be tricked into clicking a malicious link or submitting a malicious form. A successful exploit allows the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privileges of the victim, e.g. creating and modifying user accounts, changing system configuration settings and cause DoS conditions. Note: For Bosch PRAESIDEO 4.31 and newer and Bosch PRAESENSA in all versions, the confidentiality impact is considered low because user credentials are not shown in the web interface.
