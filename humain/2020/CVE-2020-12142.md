Such a user, with the required system knowledge, could use this material to decrypt in-flight communication. 2. The vulnerability requires administrative access and shell access to the EdgeConnect appliance. An admin user can access IPSec seed and nonce parameters using the CLI, REST APIs, and the Linux shell.
