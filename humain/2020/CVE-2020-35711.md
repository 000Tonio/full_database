An issue has been discovered in the arc-swap crate before 0.4.8 (and 1.x before 1.1.0) for Rust. Use of arc_swap::access::Map with the Constant test helper (or with a user-supplied implementation of the Access trait) could sometimes lead to dangling references being returned by the map.

### CVSS Score: **5**
