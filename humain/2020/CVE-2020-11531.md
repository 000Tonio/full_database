The DataEngine Xnode Server application in Zoho ManageEngine DataSecurity Plus prior to 6.0.1 does not validate the database schema name when handling a DR-SCHEMA-SYNC request. This allows an authenticated attacker to execute code in the context of the product by writing a JSP file to the webroot directory via directory traversal.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
