# CVE-2020-13822

- Published: 2020-06-04T15:15:00

The Elliptic package 6.5.2 for Node.js allows ECDSA signature malleability via variations in encoding, leading '\0' bytes, or integer overflows. This could conceivably have a security-relevant impact if an application relied on a single canonical signature.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
