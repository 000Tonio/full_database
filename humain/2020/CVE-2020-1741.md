A flaw was found in openshift-ansible. OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) 3.11 is too permissive in the way it specified CORS allowed origins during installation. An attacker, able to man-in-the-middle the connection between the user's browser and the openshift console, could use this flaw to perform a phishing attack. The main threat from this vulnerability is data confidentiality.
