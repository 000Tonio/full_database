An external control of filename vulnerability in the SD WAN component of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS Panorama allows an authenticated administrator to send a request that results in the creation and write of an arbitrary file on all firewalls managed by the Panorama. In some cases this results in arbitrary code execution with root permissions. This issue affects: All versions of PAN-OS 7.1; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than 8.1.14; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than 9.0.7.
