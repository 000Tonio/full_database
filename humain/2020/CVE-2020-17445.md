An issue was discovered in picoTCP 1.7.0. The code for processing the IPv6 destination options does not check for a valid length of the destination options header. This results in an Out-of-Bounds Read, and, depending on the memory protection mechanism, this may result in Denial-of-Service in pico_ipv6_process_destopt() in pico_ipv6.c.
