smtpd/lka_filter.c in OpenSMTPD before 6.8.0p1, in certain configurations, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via a crafted pattern of client activity, because the filter state machine does not properly maintain the I/O channel between the SMTP engine and the filters layer.

### CVSS Score: **5**
