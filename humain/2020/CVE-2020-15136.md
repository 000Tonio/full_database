# CVE-2020-15136

- Published: 2020-08-06T23:15:00

In ectd before versions 3.4.10 and 3.3.23, gateway TLS authentication is only applied to endpoints detected in DNS SRV records. When starting a gateway, TLS authentication will only be attempted on endpoints identified in DNS SRV records for a given domain, which occurs in the discoverEndpoints function. No authentication is performed against endpoints provided in the --endpoints flag. This has been fixed in versions 3.4.10 and 3.3.23 with improved documentation and deprecation of the functionality.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
