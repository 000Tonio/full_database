A vulnerability in the MIME message handling of the Domino server (versions 9 and 10) could potentially be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker resulting in a stack buffer overflow. This could allow a remote attacker to crash the server or inject code into the system which would execute with the privileges of the server.

### CVSS Score: **10**
