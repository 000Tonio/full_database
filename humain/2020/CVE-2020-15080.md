In PrestaShop from version 1.7.4.0 and before version 1.7.6.6, some files should not be in the release archive, and others should not be accessible. The problem is fixed in version 1.7.6.6 A possible workaround is to make sure `composer.json` and `docker-compose.yml` are not accessible on your server.
