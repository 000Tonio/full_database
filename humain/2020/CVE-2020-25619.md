An issue was discovered in SolarWinds N-Central 12.3.0.670. The SSH component does not restrict the Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints. An attacker can leverage an SSH feature (port forwarding with a temporary key pair) to access network services on the 127.0.0.1 interface, even though this feature was only intended for user-to-agent communication.
