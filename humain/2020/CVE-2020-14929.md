- Modified: 2023-01-28T02:03:00

Alpine before 2.23 silently proceeds to use an insecure connection after a /tls is sent in certain circumstances involving PREAUTH, which is a less secure behavior than the alternative of closing the connection and letting the user decide what they would like to do.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
