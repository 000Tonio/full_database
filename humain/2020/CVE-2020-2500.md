This improper access control vulnerability in Helpdesk allows attackers to get control of QNAP Kayako service. Attackers can access the sensitive data on QNAP Kayako server with API keys. We have replaced the API key to mitigate the vulnerability, and already fixed the issue in Helpdesk 3.0.1 and later versions.
