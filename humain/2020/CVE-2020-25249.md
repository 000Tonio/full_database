An issue was discovered in Hyland OnBase 16.0.2.83 and below, 17.0.2.109 and below, 18.0.0.37 and below, 19.8.16.1000 and below and 20.3.10.1000 and below. The server typically logs activity only when a client application specifies that logging is desired. This can be problematic for use cases in a regulated industry, where server-side logging is required in additional situations.
