# CVE-2020-12757

HashiCorp Vault and Vault Enterprise 1.4.0 and 1.4.1, when configured with the GCP Secrets Engine, may incorrectly generate GCP Credentials with the default time-to-live lease duration instead of the engine-configured setting. This may lead to generated GCP credentials being valid for longer than intended. Fixed in 1.4.2.
