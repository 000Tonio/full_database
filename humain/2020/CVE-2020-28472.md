This affects the package @aws-sdk/shared-ini-file-loader before 1.0.0-rc.9; the package aws-sdk before 2.814.0. If an attacker submits a malicious INI file to an application that parses it with loadSharedConfigFiles , they will pollute the prototype on the application. This can be exploited further depending on the context.
