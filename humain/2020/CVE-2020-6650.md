UPS companion software v1.05 & Prior is affected by ‘Eval Injection’ vulnerability. The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before using the input in a dynamic evaluation call e.g.”eval” in “Update Manager” class when software attempts to see if there are updates available. This results in arbitrary code execution on the machine where software is installed.
