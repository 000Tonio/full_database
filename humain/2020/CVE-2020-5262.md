In EasyBuild before version 4.1.2, the GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) used by EasyBuild for the GitHub integration features (like `--new-pr`, `--fro,-pr`, etc.) is shown in plain text in EasyBuild debug log files. This issue is fixed in EasyBuild v4.1.2, and in the `master`+ `develop` branches of the `easybuild-framework` repository.
