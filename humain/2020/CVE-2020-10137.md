# CVE-2020-10137

- Published: 2022-01-10T14:10:00

- Modified: 2022-01-18T17:12:00

Z-Wave devices based on Silicon Labs 700 series chipsets using S2 do not adequately authenticate or encrypt FIND_NODE_IN_RANGE frames, allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to inject a FIND_NODE_IN_RANGE frame with an invalid random payload, denying service by blocking the processing of upcoming events.

### CVSS Score: **3.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
