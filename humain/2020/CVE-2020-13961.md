Strapi before 3.0.2 could allow a remote authenticated attacker to bypass security restrictions because templates are stored in a global variable without any sanitation. By sending a specially crafted request, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to update the email template for both password reset and account confirmation emails.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
