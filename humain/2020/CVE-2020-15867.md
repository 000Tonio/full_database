# CVE-2020-15867

- Published: 2020-10-16T14:15:00

- Modified: 2022-04-26T17:06:00

The git hook feature in Gogs 0.5.5 through 0.12.2 allows for authenticated remote code execution. There can be a privilege escalation if access to this hook feature is granted to a user who does not have administrative privileges. NOTE: because this is mentioned in the documentation but not in the UI, it could be considered a "Product UI does not Warn User of Unsafe Actions" issue.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
