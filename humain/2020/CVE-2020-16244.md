GE Digital APM Classic, Versions 4.4 and prior. Salt is not used for hash calculation of passwords, making it possible to decrypt passwords. This design flaw, along with the IDOR vulnerability, puts the entire platform at high risk because an authenticated user can retrieve all user account data and then retrieve the actual passwords.

### CVSS Score: **4**
