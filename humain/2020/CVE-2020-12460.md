# CVE-2020-12460

- Published: 2020-07-27T23:15:00

- Modified: 2022-11-21T13:52:00

OpenDMARC through 1.3.2 and 1.4.x through 1.4.0-Beta1 has improper null termination in the function opendmarc_xml_parse that can result in a one-byte heap overflow in opendmarc_xml when parsing a specially crafted DMARC aggregate report. This can cause remote memory corruption when a '\0' byte overwrites the heap metadata of the next chunk and its PREV_INUSE flag.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
