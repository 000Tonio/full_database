GreenBrowser before version 1.2 has a vulnerability where apps that rely on URL Parsing to verify that a given URL is pointing to a trust server may be susceptible to many different ways to get URL parsing and verification wrong, which allows an attacker to circumvent the access control. This problem has been patched in version 1.2.
