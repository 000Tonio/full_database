A vulnerability in the scheduled meeting template feature of Cisco Webex Meetings could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to delete a scheduled meeting template that belongs to another user in their organization. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization enforcement for requests to delete scheduled meeting templates. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the Webex Meetings interface to delete a scheduled meeting template. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to delete a scheduled meeting template that belongs to a user other than themselves.
