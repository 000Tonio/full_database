A vulnerability in the CLI implementation of a specific command of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files in the underlying host file system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the parameters of a specific CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing that command with specific parameters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite the content of any arbitrary file that resides on the underlying host file system.
