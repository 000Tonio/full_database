The AWMS Mobile App for Android 2.0.0 to 2.0.5 and for iOS 2.0.0 to 2.0.8 does not verify X.509 certificates from servers, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
