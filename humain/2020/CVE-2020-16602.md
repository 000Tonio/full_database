Razer Chroma SDK Rest Server through 3.12.17 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary programs because there is a race condition in which a file created under "%PROGRAMDATA%\Razer Chroma\SDK\Apps" can be replaced before it is executed by the server. The attacker must have access to port 54236 for a registration step.
