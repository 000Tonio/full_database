An issue was discovered in the box application on HiSilicon based IPTV/H.264/H.265 video encoders. The file-upload endpoint does not enforce authentication. Attackers can send an unauthenticated HTTP request to upload a custom firmware component, possibly in conjunction with command injection, to achieve arbitrary code execution.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
