The ClearPass Policy Manager WebUI administrative interface has an authenticated command remote execution. When the attacker is already authenticated to the administrative interface, they could then exploit the system, leading to remote command execution in the underlying operating system. Resolution: Fixed in 6.7.13-HF, 6.8.5-HF, 6.8.6, 6.9.1 and higher.

### CVSS Score: **9**
