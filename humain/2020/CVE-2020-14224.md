A vulnerability in the MIME message handling of the HCL Notes v9 client could potentially be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker resulting in a stack buffer overflow. This could allow a remote attacker to crash the Notes application or inject code into the system which would execute with the privileges of the currently logged-in user.
