Acronis True Image 2021 fails to properly set ACLs of the C:\ProgramData\Acronis directory. Because some privileged processes are executed from the C:\ProgramData\Acronis, an unprivileged user can achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges by placing a DLL in one of several paths within C:\ProgramData\Acronis.
