An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8. kernel/bpf/verifier.c has an off-by-one error (with a resultant integer underflow) affecting out-of-bounds speculation on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka CID-10d2bb2e6b1d.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| PARTIAL | NONE | PARTIAL |
