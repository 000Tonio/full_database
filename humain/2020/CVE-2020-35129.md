Mautic before 3.2.4 is affected by stored XSS. An attacker with access to Social Monitoring, an application feature, could attack other users, including administrators. For example, an attacker could load an externally drafted JavaScript file that would allow them to eventually perform actions on the target user’s behalf, including changing the user’s password or email address or changing the attacker’s user role from a low-privileged user to an administrator account.
