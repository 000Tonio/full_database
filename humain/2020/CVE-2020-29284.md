The file view-chair-list.php in Multi Restaurant Table Reservation System 1.0 does not perform input validation on the table_id parameter which allows unauthenticated SQL Injection. An attacker can send malicious input in the GET request to /dashboard/view-chair-list.php?table_id= to trigger the vulnerability.
