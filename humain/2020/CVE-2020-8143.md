An Open Redirect vulnerability was discovered in Revive Adserver version < 5.0.5 and reported by HackerOne user hoangn144. A remote attacker could trick logged-in users to open a specifically crafted link and have them redirected to any destination.The CSRF protection of the “/www/admin/*-modify.php” could be skipped if no meaningful parameter was sent. No action was performed, but the user was still redirected to the target page, specified via the “returnurl” GET parameter.
