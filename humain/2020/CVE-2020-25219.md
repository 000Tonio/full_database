- Modified: 2022-04-28T18:32:00

url::recvline in url.cpp in libproxy 0.4.x through 0.4.15 allows a remote HTTP server to trigger uncontrolled recursion via a response composed of an infinite stream that lacks a newline character. This leads to stack exhaustion.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| --- | --- | --- |
