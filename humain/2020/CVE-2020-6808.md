# CVE-2020-6808

- Published: 2020-03-25T22:15:00

When a JavaScript URL (javascript:) is evaluated and the result is a string, this string is parsed to create an HTML document, which is then presented. Previously, this document's URL (as reported by the document.location property, for example) was the originating javascript: URL which could lead to spoofing attacks; it is now correctly the URL of the originating document. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 74.
