A UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following vulnerability in chkstat of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 set permissions intended for specific binaries on other binaries because it erroneously followed symlinks. The symlinks can't be controlled by attackers on default systems, so exploitation is difficult. This issue affects: SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 permissions versions prior to 2015.09.28.1626-17.27.1. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 permissions versions prior to 20181116-9.23.1. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 permissions versions prior to 2013.1.7-0.6.12.1.
