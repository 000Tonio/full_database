# CVE-2020-17525

- Published: 2021-03-17T10:15:00

- Modified: 2022-01-01T18:03:00

Subversion's mod_authz_svn module will crash if the server is using in-repository authz rules with the AuthzSVNReposRelativeAccessFile option and a client sends a request for a non-existing repository URL. This can lead to disruption for users of the service. This issue was fixed in mod_dav_svn+mod_authz_svn servers 1.14.1 and mod_dav_svn+mod_authz_svn servers 1.10.7
