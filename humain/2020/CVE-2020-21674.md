Heap-based buffer overflow in archive_string_append_from_wcs() (archive_string.c) in libarchive-3.4.1dev allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write in heap memory resulting into a crash) via a crafted archive file. NOTE: this only affects users who downloaded the development code from GitHub. Users of the product's official releases are unaffected.
