A vulnerability has been identified in JT2Go (All versions < V13.1.0), Teamcenter Visualization (All versions < V13.1.0). When opening a specially crafted xml file, the application could disclose arbitrary files to remote attackers. This is because of the passing of specially crafted content to the underlying XML parser without taking proper restrictions such as prohibiting an external dtd. (ZDI-CAN-11890)
