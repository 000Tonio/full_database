An arbitrary memory write vulnerability in Asylo versions up to 0.6.0 allows an untrusted attacker to make a call to ecall_restore using the attribute output which fails to check the range of a pointer. An attacker can use this pointer to write to arbitrary memory addresses including those within the secure enclave We recommend upgrading past commit 382da2b8b09cbf928668a2445efb778f76bd9c8a
