- Published: 2020-10-16T14:15:00

- Modified: 2020-10-27T19:19:00

A flaw was found in JBoss EAP, where the authentication configuration is set-up using a legacy SecurityRealm, to delegate to a legacy PicketBox SecurityDomain, and then reloaded to admin-only mode. This flaw allows an attacker to perform a complete authentication bypass by using an arbitrary user and password. The highest threat to vulnerability is to system availability.

### CVSS Score: **6.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
