A vulnerability in the web application of Cisco Smart Software Manager On-Prem (SSM On-Prem) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create arbitrary user accounts. The vulnerability is due to the lack of authorization controls in the web application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to add user accounts to the configuration of an affected device. These accounts would not be administrator or operator accounts.
