The code for downloading files did not properly take care of special characters, which led to an attacker being able to cut off the file ending at an earlier position, leading to a different file type being downloaded than shown in the dialog. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 78.1, Firefox < 79, and Thunderbird < 78.1.
