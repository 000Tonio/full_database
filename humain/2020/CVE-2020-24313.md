Etoile Web Design Ultimate Appointment Booking & Scheduling WordPress Plugin v1.1.9 and lower does not sanitize the value of the "Appointment_ID" GET parameter before echoing it back out inside an input tag. This results in a reflected XSS vulnerability that attackers can exploit with a specially crafted URL.
