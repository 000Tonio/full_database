There is an input validation vulnerability in a PON terminal product of ZTE, which supports the creation of WAN connections through WEB management pages. The front-end limits the length of the WAN connection name that is created, but the HTTP proxy is available to be used to bypass the limitation. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to tamper with the parameter value. This affects: ZTE F680 V9.0.10P1N6
