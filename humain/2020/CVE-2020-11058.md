# CVE-2020-11058

- Published: 2020-05-12T21:15:00

- Modified: 2021-10-07T17:20:00

In FreeRDP after 1.1 and before 2.0.0, a stream out-of-bounds seek in rdp_read_font_capability_set could lead to a later out-of-bounds read. As a result, a manipulated client or server might force a disconnect due to an invalid data read. This has been fixed in 2.0.0.
