A malicious guest compromised before a container creation (e.g. a malicious guest image or a guest running multiple containers) can trick the kata runtime into mounting the untrusted container filesystem on any host path, potentially allowing for code execution on the host. This issue affects: Kata Containers 1.11 versions earlier than 1.11.1; Kata Containers 1.10 versions earlier than 1.10.5; Kata Containers 1.9 and earlier versions.
