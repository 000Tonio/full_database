MendixSSO <= 2.1.1 contains endpoints that make use of the openid handler, which is suffering from a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability via the URL path. This is caused by the reflection of user-supplied data without appropriate HTML escaping or output encoding. As a result, a JavaScript payload may be injected into the above endpoint causing it to be executed within the context of the victim's browser.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
