LabVantage LIMS 8.3 does not properly maintain the confidentiality of database names. For example, the web application exposes the database name. An attacker might be able to enumerate database names by providing his own database name in a request, because the response will return an 'Unrecognized Database exception message if the database does not exist.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
