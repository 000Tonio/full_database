The sync endpoint in YubiKey Validation Server before 2.40 allows remote attackers to replay an OTP. NOTE: this issue is potentially relevant to persons outside Yubico who operate a self-hosted OTP validation service with a non-default configuration such as an open sync pool; the issue does NOT affect YubiCloud.
