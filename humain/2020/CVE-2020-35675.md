BigProf Online Invoicing System before 3.0 offers a functionality that allows an administrator to move the records of members across groups. The applicable endpoint (admin/pageTransferOwnership.php) lacks CSRF protection, resulting in an attacker being able to escalate their privileges to Administrator and effectively taking over the application.
