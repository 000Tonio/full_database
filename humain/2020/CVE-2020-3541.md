A vulnerability in the media engine component of Cisco Webex Meetings Client for Windows, Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App for Windows, and Cisco Webex Teams for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to gain access to sensitive information. The vulnerability is due to unsafe logging of authentication requests by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by reading log files that are stored in the application directory. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain access to sensitive information, which could be used in further attacks.
