The EasyCorp ZenTao Pro application suffers from an OS command injection vulnerability in its '/pro/repo-create.html' component. After authenticating to the ZenTao dashboard, attackers may construct and send arbitrary OS commands via the POST parameter 'path', and those commands will run in an elevated SYSTEM context on the underlying Windows operating system.
