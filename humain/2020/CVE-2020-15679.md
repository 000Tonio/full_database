An OAuth session fixation vulnerability existed in the VPN login flow, where an attacker could craft a custom login URL, convince a VPN user to login via that URL, and obtain authenticated access as that user. This issue is limited to cases where attacker and victim are sharing the same source IP and could allow the ability to view session states and disconnect VPN sessions. This vulnerability affects Mozilla VPN iOS 1.0.7 < (929), Mozilla VPN Windows < 1.2.2, and Mozilla VPN Android 1.1.0 < (1360).
