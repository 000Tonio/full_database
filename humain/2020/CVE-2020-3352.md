A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access hidden commands. The vulnerability is due to the presence of undocumented configuration commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing specific steps that make the hidden commands accessible. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to make configuration changes to various sections of an affected device that should not be exposed to CLI access.
