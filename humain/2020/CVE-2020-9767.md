A vulnerability related to Dynamic-link Library (“DLL”) loading in the Zoom Sharing Service would allow an attacker who had local access to a machine on which the service was running with elevated privileges to elevate their system privileges as well through use of a malicious DLL. Zoom addressed this issue, which only applies to Windows users, in the 5.0.4 client release.
