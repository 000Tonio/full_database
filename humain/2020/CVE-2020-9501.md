Attackers can obtain Cloud Key information from the Dahua Web P2P control in specific ways. Cloud Key is used to authenticate the connection between the client tool and the platform. An attacker may use the leaked Cloud Key to impersonate the client to connect to the platform, resulting in additional consumption of platform server resources. Versions with Build time before April 2020 are affected.
