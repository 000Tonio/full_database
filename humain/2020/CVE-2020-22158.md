MediaKind (formerly Ericsson) RX8200 5.13.3 devices are vulnerable to multiple reflected and stored XSS. An attacker has to inject JavaScript code directly in the "path" or "Services+ID" parameters and send the URL to a user in order to exploit reflected XSS. In the case of stored XSS, an attacker must modify the "name" parameter with the malicious code.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
