Citrix Secure Mail for Android before 20.11.0 suffers from improper access control allowing unauthenticated access to read limited calendar related data stored within Secure Mail. Note that a malicious app would need to be installed on the Android device or a threat actor would need to execute arbitrary code on the Android device.
