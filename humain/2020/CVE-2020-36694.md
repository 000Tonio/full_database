# CVE-2020-36694

- Published: 2023-05-21T23:15:00

An issue was discovered in netfilter in the Linux kernel before 5.10. There can be a use-after-free in the packet processing context, because the per-CPU sequence count is mishandled during concurrent iptables rules replacement. This could be exploited with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in an unprivileged namespace. NOTE: cc00bca was reverted in 5.12.
