# CVE-2020-8287

Node.js versions before 10.23.1, 12.20.1, 14.15.4, 15.5.1 allow two copies of a header field in an HTTP request (for example, two Transfer-Encoding header fields). In this case, Node.js identifies the first header field and ignores the second. This can lead to HTTP Request Smuggling.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
