Patient Information Center iX (PICiX) Versions B.02, C.02, C.03, PerformanceBridge Focal Point Version A.01, IntelliVue patient monitors MX100, MX400-MX850, and MP2-MP90 Versions N and prior, IntelliVue X3 and X2 Versions N and prior. The product receives input that is expected to be well-formed (i.e., to comply with a certain syntax) but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input complies with the syntax, causing the certificate enrollment service to crash. It does not impact monitoring but prevents new devices from enrolling.
