CSRF vulnerabilities in the /cgi-bin/ directory of the WAVLINK WN530H4 M30H4.V5030.190403 allow an attacker to remotely access router endpoints, because these endpoints do not contain CSRF tokens. If a user is authenticated in the router portal, then this attack will work.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | COMPLETE |
