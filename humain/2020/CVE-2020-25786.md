** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** webinc/js/info.php on D-Link DIR-816L 2.06.B09_BETA and DIR-803 1.04.B02 devices allows XSS via the HTTP Referer header. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. NOTE: this is typically not exploitable because of URL encoding (except in Internet Explorer) and because a web page cannot specify that a client should make an additional HTTP request with an arbitrary Referer header.
