Insufficient folder permissions used by system functions in ABB System 800xA products OPCServer for AC800M (versions 6.0 and earlier) and Control Builder M Professional, MMSServer for AC800M, Base Software for SoftControl (version 6.1 and earlier) allow low privileged users to read, modify, add and delete system and application files. An authenticated attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerabilities could escalate his/her privileges, cause system functions to stop and to corrupt user applications.
