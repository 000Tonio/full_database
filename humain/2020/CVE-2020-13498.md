An exploitable vulnerability exists in the way Pixar OpenUSD 20.05 handles parses certain encoded types. A specially crafted malformed file can trigger an arbitrary out of bounds memory access which could lead to information disclosure. This vulnerability could be used to bypass mitigations and aid further exploitation. To trigger this vulnerability, the victim needs to access an attacker-provided malformed file.
