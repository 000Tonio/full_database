be_teacher in class-lp-admin-ajax.php in the LearnPress plugin 3.2.6.5 and earlier for WordPress allows any registered user to assign itself the teacher role via the wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=learnpress_be_teacher URI without any additional permission checks. Therefore, any user can change its role to an instructor/teacher and gain access to otherwise restricted data.
