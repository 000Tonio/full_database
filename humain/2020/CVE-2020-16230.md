All version of Ewon Flexy and Cosy prior to 14.1 use wildcards such as (*) under which domains can request resources. An attacker with local access and high privileges could inject scripts into the Cross-origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration that could abuse this vulnerability, allowing the attacker to retrieve limited confidential information through sniffing.
