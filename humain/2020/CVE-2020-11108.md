# CVE-2020-11108

- Published: 2020-05-11T15:15:00

- Modified: 2020-05-27T18:15:00

The Gravity updater in Pi-hole through 4.4 allows an authenticated adversary to upload arbitrary files. This can be abused for Remote Code Execution by writing to a PHP file in the web directory. (Also, it can be used in conjunction with the sudo rule for the www-data user to escalate privileges to root.) The code error is in gravity_DownloadBlocklistFromUrl in gravity.sh.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
