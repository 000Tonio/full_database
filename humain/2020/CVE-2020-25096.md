LogRhythm Platform Manager (PM) 7.4.9 has Incorrect Access Control. Users within LogRhythm can be delegated different roles and privileges, intended to limit what data and services they can interact with. However, no access control is enforced for WebSocket-based communication to the PM application server, which will forward requests to any configured back-end server, regardless of whether the user's access rights should permit this. As a result, even the most low-privileged user can interact with any back-end component that has a LogRhythm agent installed.
