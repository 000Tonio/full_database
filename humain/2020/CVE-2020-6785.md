Loading a DLL through an Uncontrolled Search Path Element in Bosch BVMS and BVMS Viewer in versions 10.1.0, 10.0.1, 10.0.0 and 9.0.0 and older potentially allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a victim's system. This affects both the installer as well as the installed application. This also affects Bosch DIVAR IP 7000 R2, Bosch DIVAR IP all-in-one 5000 and Bosch DIVAR IP all-in-one 7000 with installers and installed BVMS versions prior to BVMS 10.1.1.
