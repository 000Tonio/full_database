# CVE-2020-36711

The Avada theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the update_layout function in versions up to, and including, 6.2.3 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for contributor-level attackers, and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
