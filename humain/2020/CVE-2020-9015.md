** DISPUTED ** Arista DCS-7050QX-32S-R 4.20.9M, DCS-7050CX3-32S-R 4.20.11M, and DCS-7280SRAM-48C6-R 4.22.0.1F devices (and possibly other products) allow attackers to bypass intended TACACS+ shell restrictions via a | character. NOTE: the vendor reports that this is a configuration issue relating to an overly permissive regular expression in the TACACS+ server permitted commands.
