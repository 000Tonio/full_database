# CVE-2020-10236

- Published: 2020-03-09T16:15:00

An issue was discovered in Froxlor before 0.10.14. It created files with static names in /tmp during installation if the installation directory was not writable. This allowed local attackers to cause DoS or disclose information out of the config files, because of _createUserdataConf in install/lib/class.FroxlorInstall.php.
