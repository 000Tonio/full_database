Clusters using Calico (version 3.14.0 and below), Calico Enterprise (version 2.8.2 and below), may be vulnerable to information disclosure if IPv6 is enabled but unused. A compromised pod with sufficient privilege is able to reconfigure the nodeâ€™s IPv6 interface due to the node accepting route advertisement by default, allowing the attacker to redirect full or partial network traffic from the node to the compromised pod.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
