A reachable assertion issue was found in the USB EHCI emulation code of QEMU. It could occur while processing USB requests due to missing handling of DMA memory map failure. A malicious privileged user within the guest may abuse this flaw to send bogus USB requests and crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service.
