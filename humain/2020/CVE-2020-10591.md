An issue was discovered in Walmart Labs Concord before 1.44.0. CORS Access-Control-Allow-Origin headers have a potentially unsafe dependency on Origin headers, and are not configurable. This allows remote attackers to discover host information, nodes, API metadata, and references to usernames via api/v1/apikey.
