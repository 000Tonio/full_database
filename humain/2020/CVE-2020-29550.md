An issue was discovered in URVE Build 24.03.2020. The password of an integration user account (used for the connection of the MS Office 365 Integration Service) is stored in cleartext in configuration files as well as in the database. The following files contain the password in cleartext: Profiles/urve/files/sql_db.backup, Server/data/pg_wal/000000010000000A000000DD, Server/data/base/16384/18617, and Server/data/base/17202/8708746. This causes the password to be displayed as cleartext in the HTML code as roomsreservationimport_password in /urve/roomsreservationimport/roomsreservationimport/update-HTML5.
