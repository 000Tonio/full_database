# CVE-2020-36700

- Published: 2023-06-07T02:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-07T02:45:00

The Page Builder: KingComposer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 2.9.3. This is due to a security nonce being leaked in the '/wp-admin/index.php' page. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to change arbitrary WordPress options, delete arbitrary files/folders, and inject arbitrary content.

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| undefined | undefined | undefined |
