An issue was discovered in the acf-to-rest-api plugin through 3.1.0 for WordPress. It allows an insecure direct object reference via permalinks manipulation, as demonstrated by a wp-json/acf/v3/options/ request that reads sensitive information in the wp_options table, such as the login and pass values.
