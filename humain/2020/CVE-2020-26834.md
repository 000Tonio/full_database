SAP HANA Database, version - 2.0, does not correctly validate the username when performing SAML bearer token-based user authentication. It is possible to manipulate a valid existing SAML bearer token to authenticate as a user whose name is identical to the truncated username for whom the SAML bearer token was issued.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
