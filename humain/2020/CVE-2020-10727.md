A flaw was found in ActiveMQ Artemis management API from version 2.7.0 up until 2.12.0, where a user inadvertently stores passwords in plaintext in the Artemis shadow file (etc/artemis-users.properties file) when executing the `resetUsers` operation. A local attacker can use this flaw to read the contents of the Artemis shadow file.
