Exposed Erlang Cookie could lead to Remote Command Execution (RCE) attack. Communication between Erlang nodes is done by exchanging a shared secret (aka "magic cookie"). There are cases where the magic cookie is included in the content of the logs. An attacker can use the cookie to attach to an Erlang node and run OS level commands on the system running the Erlang node. Affects version: 6.5.1. Fix version: 6.6.0.
