The CorsairLLAccess64.sys and CorsairLLAccess32.sys drivers in CORSAIR iCUE before 3.25.60 allow local non-privileged users (including low-integrity level processes) to read and write to arbitrary physical memory locations, and consequently gain NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM privileges, via a function call such as MmMapIoSpace.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
