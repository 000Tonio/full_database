fishProtocol::establishConnection in fish/fish.cpp in KDE kio-extras through 20.04.0 makes a cacheAuthentication call even if the user had not set the keepPassword option. This may lead to unintended KWallet storage of a password.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
