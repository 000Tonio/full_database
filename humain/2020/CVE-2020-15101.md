# CVE-2020-15101

- Published: 2020-07-14T22:15:00

- Modified: 2021-11-18T18:10:00

In freewvs before 0.1.1, a directory structure of more than 1000 nested directories can interrupt a freewvs scan due to Python's recursion limit and os.walk(). This can be problematic in a case where an administrator scans the dirs of potentially untrusted users. This has been patched in 0.1.1.
