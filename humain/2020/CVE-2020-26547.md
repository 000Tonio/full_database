Monal before 4.9 does not implement proper sender verification on MAM and Message Carbon (XEP-0280) results. This allows a remote attacker (able to send stanzas to a victim) to inject arbitrary messages into the local history, with full control over the sender and receiver displayed to the victim.

### CVSS Score: **5**
