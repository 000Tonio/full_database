# CVE-2020-36741

- Published: 2023-07-01T05:15:00

- Modified: 2023-07-01T05:15:00

The MultiVendorX plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 3.5.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the submit_comment() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to submit comments via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

### CVSS Score: **null**
