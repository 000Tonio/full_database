The JetBackup â€“ WP Backup, Migrate & Restore plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure in versions up to, and including, 1.4.0 due to a lack of proper capability checking on the backup_guard_get_manual_modal function called via an AJAX action. This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers, and above, to invoke the function and obtain database table information.
