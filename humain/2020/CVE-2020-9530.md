An issue was discovered on Xiaomi MIUI V11.0.5.0.QFAEUXM devices. The export component of GetApps(com.xiaomi.mipicks) mishandles the functionality of opening other components. Attackers need to induce users to open specific web pages in a specific network environment. By jumping to the WebView component of Messaging(com.android.MMS) and loading malicious web pages, information leakage can occur. This is fixed on version: 2001122; 11.0.1.54.
