# CVE-2020-36738

The Cool Timeline (Horizontal & Vertical Timeline) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.0.2. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ctl_save() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save field icons via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

### CVSS Score: **null**
