Tor before 0.3.5.10, 0.4.x before 0.4.1.9, and 0.4.2.x before 0.4.2.7 allows remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service (memory leak), aka TROVE-2020-004. This occurs in circpad_setup_machine_on_circ because a circuit-padding machine can be negotiated twice on the same circuit.

### CVSS Score: **5**
