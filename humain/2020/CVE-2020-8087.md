SMC Networks D3G0804W D3GNV5M-3.5.1.6.10_GA devices allow remote command execution by leveraging access to the Network Diagnostic Tools screen, as demonstrated by an admin login. The attacker must use a Parameter Pollution approach against goform/formSetDiagnosticToolsFmPing by providing the vlu_diagnostic_tools__ping_address parameter twice: once with a shell metacharacter and a command name, and once with a command argument.

### CVSS Score: **10**
