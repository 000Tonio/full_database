If LDAP authentication is enabled, an LDAP authentication bypass vulnerability in Trend Micro Deep Security 10.x-12.x could allow an unauthenticated attacker with prior knowledge of the targeted organization to bypass manager authentication. Enabling multi-factor authentication prevents this attack. Installations using manager native authentication or SAML authentication are not impacted by this vulnerability.
