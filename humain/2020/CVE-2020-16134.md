# CVE-2020-16134

- Published: 2020-08-04T19:15:00

- Modified: 2021-07-21T11:39:00

An issue was discovered on Swisscom Internet Box 2, Internet Box Standard, Internet Box Plus prior to 10.04.38, Internet Box 3 prior to 11.01.20, and Internet Box light prior to 08.06.06. Given the (user-configurable) credentials for the local Web interface or physical access to a device's plus or reset button, an attacker can create a user with elevated privileges on the Sysbus-API. This can then be used to modify local or remote SSH access, thus allowing a login session as the superuser.
