# CVE-2020-36712

- Published: 2023-06-07T02:15:00

The Kali Forms plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Post Deletion in versions up to, and including, 2.1.1. This is due to the kaliforms_form_delete_uploaded_file function lacking any privilege or user protections. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete any site post or page with the id parameter.
