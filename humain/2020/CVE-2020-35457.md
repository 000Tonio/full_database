** DISPUTED ** GNOME GLib before 2.65.3 has an integer overflow, that might lead to an out-of-bounds write, in g_option_group_add_entries. NOTE: the vendor's position is "Realistically this is not a security issue. The standard pattern is for callers to provide a static list of option entries in a fixed number of calls to g_option_group_add_entries()." The researcher states that this pattern is undocumented.
