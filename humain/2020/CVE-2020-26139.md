# CVE-2020-26139

- Published: 2021-05-11T20:15:00

- Modified: 2022-09-30T03:03:00

An issue was discovered in the kernel in NetBSD 7.1. An Access Point (AP) forwards EAPOL frames to other clients even though the sender has not yet successfully authenticated to the AP. This might be abused in projected Wi-Fi networks to launch denial-of-service attacks against connected clients and makes it easier to exploit other vulnerabilities in connected clients.

### CVSS Score: **2.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
