# CVE-2020-36743

- Published: 2023-07-01T05:15:00

The Product Catalog Simple plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.13. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the implecode_save_products_meta() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update product meta via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

### CVSS Score: **null**
