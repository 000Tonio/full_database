Missing access control restrictions in the Hypervisor component of the ACRN Project (v2.0 and v1.6.1) allow a malicious entity, with root access in the Service VM userspace, to abuse the PCIe assign/de-assign Hypercalls via crafted ioctls and payloads. This attack results in a corrupt state and Denial of Service (DoS) for previously assigned PCIe devices to the Service VM at runtime.
