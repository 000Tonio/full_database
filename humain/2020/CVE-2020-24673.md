In S+ Operations and S+ Historian, a successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system and in some cases issue commands to the operating system. This can lead to a loss of confidentiality and data integrity or even affect the product behavior and its availability.
