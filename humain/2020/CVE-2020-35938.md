PHP Object injection vulnerabilities in the Post Grid plugin before 2.0.73 for WordPress allow remote authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary PHP objects due to insecure unserialization of data supplied in a remotely hosted crafted payload in the source parameter via AJAX. The action must be set to post_grid_import_xml_layouts.
