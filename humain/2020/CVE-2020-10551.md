QQBrowser before 10.5.3870.400 installs a Windows service TsService.exe. This file is writable by anyone belonging to the NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users group, which includes all local and remote users. This can be abused by local attackers to escalate privileges to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM by writing a malicious executable to the location of TsService.
