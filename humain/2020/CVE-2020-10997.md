Percona XtraBackup before 2.4.20 unintentionally writes the command line to any resulting backup file output. This may include sensitive arguments passed at run time. In addition, when --history is passed at run time, this command line is also written to the PERCONA_SCHEMA.xtrabackup_history table.
