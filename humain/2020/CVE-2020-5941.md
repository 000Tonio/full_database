On BIG-IP versions 16.0.0-16.0.0.1 and 15.1.0-15.1.0.5, using the RESOLV::lookup command within an iRule may cause the Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) to generate a core file and restart. This issue occurs when data exceeding the maximum limit of a hostname passes to the RESOLV::lookup command.
