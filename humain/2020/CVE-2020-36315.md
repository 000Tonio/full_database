# CVE-2020-36315

- Published: 2021-04-07T21:15:00

In RELIC before 2020-08-01, RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature forgery can occur because certain checks of the padding (and of the first two bytes) are inadequate. NOTE: this requires that a low public exponent (such as 3) is being used. The product, by default, does not generate RSA keys with such a low number.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
