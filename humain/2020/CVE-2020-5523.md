- Modified: 2020-01-31T20:24:00

Android App 'MyPallete' and some of the Android banking applications based on 'MyPallete' do not verify X.509 certificates from servers, and also do not properly validate certificates with host-mismatch, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
