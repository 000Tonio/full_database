A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App for Windows could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on an end-user system. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of URL parameters that are sent from a website to the affected application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to follow a URL to a website that is designed to submit crafted input to the affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the affected system, possibly corrupting or deleting critical system files.
