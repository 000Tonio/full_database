The Backup functionality in Grav CMS through 1.7.0-rc.17 allows an authenticated attacker to read arbitrary local files on the underlying server by exploiting a path-traversal technique. (This vulnerability can also be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker due to a lack of CSRF protection.)

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| --- | --- | --- |
