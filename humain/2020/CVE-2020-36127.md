Pax Technology PAXSTORE v7.0.8_20200511171508 and lower is affected by an information disclosure vulnerability. Through the PUK signature functionality, an administrator will not have access to the current p12 certificate and password. When accessing this functionality, the administrator has the option to replace the current certificate and it is not possible to view the certificate password (p12) already deployed on the platform. The replacement p12 certificate returns to users in base64 with its password, which can be accessed by non-administrator users.
