Grandstream HT800 series firmware version 1.0.17.5 and below is vulnerable to a denial of service attack against the TR-069 service. An unauthenticated remote attacker can stop the service due to a NULL pointer dereference in the TR-069 service. This condition is triggered due to mishandling of the HTTP Authentication field.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
