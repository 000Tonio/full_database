# CVE-2020-13164

- Published: 2020-05-19T22:15:00

- Modified: 2021-07-21T11:39:00

In Wireshark 3.2.0 to 3.2.3, 3.0.0 to 3.0.10, and 2.6.0 to 2.6.16, the NFS dissector could crash. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-nfs.c by preventing excessive recursion, such as for a cycle in the directory graph on a filesystem.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
