Tufin SecureChange prior to R19.3 HF3 and R20-1 HF1 are vulnerable to stored XSS. The successful exploitation requires admin privileges (for storing the XSS payload itself), and can exploit (be triggered by) unauthenticated users. All TOS versions with SecureChange deployments prior to R19.3 HF3 and R20-1 HF1 are affected. Vulnerabilities were fixed in R19.3 HF3 and R20-1 HF1
