A vulnerability in Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to obtain confidential information from an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient protection of confidential information on an affected device. An attacker at any privilege level could exploit this vulnerability by accessing local filesystems and extracting sensitive information from them. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view sensitive data, which they could use to elevate their privilege.
