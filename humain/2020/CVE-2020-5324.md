Dell Client Consumer and Commercial Platforms contain an Arbitrary File Overwrite Vulnerability. The vulnerability is limited to the Dell Firmware Update Utility during the time window while being executed by an administrator. During this time window, a locally authenticated low-privileged malicious user could exploit this vulnerability by tricking an administrator into overwriting arbitrary files via a symlink attack. The vulnerability does not affect the actual binary payload that the update utility delivers.
