SAP Solution Manager (Problem Context Manager), version 7.2, does not perform the necessary authentication, allowing an attacker to consume large amounts of memory, causing the system to crash and read restricted data (files visible for technical administration users of the diagnostics agent).

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
