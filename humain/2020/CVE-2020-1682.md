An input validation vulnerability exists in Juniper Networks Junos OS, allowing an attacker to crash the srxpfe process, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) through the use of specific maintenance commands. The srxpfe process restarts automatically, but continuous execution of the commands could lead to an extended Denial of Service condition.
