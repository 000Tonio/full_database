In Epson iProjection v2.30, the driver file EMP_MPAU.sys allows local users to cause a denial of service (BSOD) or possibly have unspecified other impact because of not validating input values from IOCtl 0x9C402406 and IOCtl 0x9C40240A. (0x9C402402 has only a NULL pointer dereference.) This affects \Device\EMPMPAUIO and \DosDevices\EMPMPAU.
