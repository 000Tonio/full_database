The system console configuration option 'log-out-on-disconnect' In Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved fails to log out an active CLI session when the console cable is disconnected. This could allow a malicious attacker with physical access to the console the ability to resume a previous interactive session and possibly gain administrative privileges. This issue affects all Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions after 18.4R1-EVO, prior to 20.2R1-EVO.
