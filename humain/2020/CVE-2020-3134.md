A vulnerability in the zip decompression engine of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of zip files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending an email message with a crafted zip-compressed attachment. A successful exploit could trigger a restart of the content-scanning process, causing a temporary DoS condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco ESA releases earlier than 13.0.
