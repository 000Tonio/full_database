It was found that the AMQ Online console is vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) which is exploitable in cases where preflight checks are not instigated or bypassed. For example authorised users using an older browser with Adobe Flash are vulnerable when targeted by an attacker. This flaw affects all versions of AMQ-Online prior to 1.5.2 and Enmasse versions 0.31.0-rc1 up until but not including 0.32.2.
