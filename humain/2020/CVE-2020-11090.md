In Indy Node 1.12.2, there is an Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability. Indy Node has a bug in TAA handling code. The current primary can be crashed with a malformed transaction from a client, which leads to a view change. Repeated rapid view changes have the potential of bringing down the network. This is fixed in version 1.12.3.
