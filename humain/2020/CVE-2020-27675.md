# CVE-2020-27675

- Published: 2020-10-22T21:15:00

- Modified: 2022-04-26T16:29:00

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.9.1, as used with Xen through 4.14.x. drivers/xen/events/events_base.c allows event-channel removal during the event-handling loop (a race condition). This can cause a use-after-free or NULL pointer dereference, as demonstrated by a dom0 crash via events for an in-reconfiguration paravirtualized device, aka CID-073d0552ead5.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**
