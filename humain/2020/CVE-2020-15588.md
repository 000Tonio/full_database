An issue was discovered in the client side of Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central 10.0.552.W. An attacker-controlled server can trigger an integer overflow in InternetSendRequestEx and InternetSendRequestByBitrate that leads to a heap-based buffer overflow and Remote Code Execution with SYSTEM privileges. This issue will occur only when untrusted communication is initiated with server. In cloud, Agent will always connect with trusted communication.
