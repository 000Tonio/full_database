An information exposure through log file vulnerability where sensitive fields are recorded in the configuration log without masking on Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software when the after-change-detail custom syslog field is enabled for configuration logs and the sensitive field appears multiple times in one log entry. The first instance of the sensitive field is masked but subsequent instances are left in clear text. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.16; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.10; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.4.
