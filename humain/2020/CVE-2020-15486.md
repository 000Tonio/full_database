# CVE-2020-15486

An issue was discovered on Dr Trust ECG Pen 2.00.08 devices. Because the Bluetooth LE support is implemented without a requirement for pairing or security, any attacker can access the GATT server of the device and can sniff the data being broadcasted while a measurement is being done. Also, saved data can also be extracted over a Bluetooth connection. In addition, an attacker can launch a man-in-the-middle attack against data integrity.

### CVSS Score: **3.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
