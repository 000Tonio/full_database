An arbitrary file deletion vulnerability in rConfig 3.9.5 has been fixed for 3.9.6. This vulnerability gave attackers the ability to send a crafted request to /lib/ajaxHandlers/ajaxDeleteAllLoggingFiles.php by specifying a path in the path parameter and an extension in the ext parameter and delete all the files with that extension in that path.
