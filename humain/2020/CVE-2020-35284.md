Flamingo (aka FlamingoIM) through 2020-09-29 allows ../ directory traversal because the only ostensibly unpredictable part of a file-transfer request is an MD5 computation; however, this computation occurs on the client side, and the computation details can be easily determined because the product's source code is available.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
