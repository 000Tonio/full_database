In XWiki before version 12.5 and 11.10.6, any user with SCRIPT right (EDIT right before XWiki 7.4) can gain access to the application server Servlet context which contains tools allowing to instantiate arbitrary Java objects and invoke methods that may lead to arbitrary code execution. This is patched in XWiki 12.5 and XWiki 11.10.6.
