Dell EMC Unity, Unity XT, and UnityVSA versions prior to 5.0.4.0.5.012 contain a plain-text password storage vulnerability. A user credentials (including the Unisphere admin privilege user) password is stored in a plain text in multiple log files. A local authenticated attacker with access to the log files may use the exposed password to gain access with the privileges of the compromised user.

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
