AT91bootstrap before 3.9.2 does not properly wipe encryption and authentication keys from memory before passing control to a less privileged software component. This can be exploited to disclose these keys and subsequently encrypt and sign the next boot stage (such as the bootloader).

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
