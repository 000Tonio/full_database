# CVE-2020-36742

- Published: 2023-07-01T05:15:00

The Custom Field Template plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.5.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the edit_meta_value() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to edit meta field values via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
