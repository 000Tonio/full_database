This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR R6700 V1.0.4.84_10.0.58 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of string table file uploads. A crafted gui_region in a string table file can trigger an overflow of a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the web server. Was ZDI-CAN-9756.
