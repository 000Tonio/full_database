In Firecracker 0.20.x before 0.20.1 and 0.21.x before 0.21.2, the network stack can freeze under heavy ingress traffic. This can result in a denial of service on the microVM when it is configured with a single network interface, and an availability problem for the microVM network interface on which the issue is triggered.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
