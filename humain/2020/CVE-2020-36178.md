oal_ipt_addBridgeIsolationRules on TP-Link TL-WR840N 6_EU_0.9.1_4.16 devices allows OS command injection because a raw string entered from the web interface (an IP address field) is used directly for a call to the system library function (for iptables). NOTE: oal_ipt_addBridgeIsolationRules is not the only function that calls util_execSystem.
