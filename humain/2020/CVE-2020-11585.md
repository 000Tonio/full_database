There is an information disclosure issue in DNN (formerly DotNetNuke) 9.5 within the built-in Activity-Feed/Messaging/Userid/ Message Center module. A registered user is able to enumerate any file in the Admin File Manager (other than ones contained in a secure folder) by sending themselves a message with the file attached, e.g., by using an arbitrary small integer value in the fileIds parameter.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
