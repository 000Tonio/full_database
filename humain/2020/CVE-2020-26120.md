# CVE-2020-26120

- Published: 2020-09-27T21:15:00

XSS exists in the MobileFrontend extension for MediaWiki before 1.34.4 because section.line is mishandled during regex section line replacement from PageGateway. Using crafted HTML, an attacker can elicit an XSS attack via jQuery's parseHTML method, which can cause image callbacks to fire even without the element being appended to the DOM.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
