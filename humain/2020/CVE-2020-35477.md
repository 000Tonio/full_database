# CVE-2020-35477

- Published: 2020-12-18T08:15:00

MediaWiki before 1.35.1 blocks legitimate attempts to hide log entries in some situations. If one sets MediaWiki:Mainpage to Special:MyLanguage/Main Page, visits a log entry on Special:Log, and toggles the "Change visibility of selected log entries" checkbox (or a tags checkbox) next to it, there is a redirection to the main page's action=historysubmit (instead of the desired behavior in which a revision-deletion form appears).

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
