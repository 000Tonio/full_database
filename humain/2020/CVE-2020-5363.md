Select Dell Client Consumer and Commercial platforms include an issue that allows the BIOS Admin password to be changed through Dell's manageability interface without knowledge of the current BIOS Admin password. This could potentially allow an unauthorized actor, with physical access and/or OS administrator privileges to the device, to gain privileged access to the platform and the hard drive.
