Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in bluewrench-video-widget.php in the Blue Wrench Video Widget plugin before 2.0.0 for WordPress allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that embed arbitrary URLs via the bw_url parameter in the bw-videos page to wp-admin/admin.php, as demonstrated by embedding a URL to a JavaScript file.
