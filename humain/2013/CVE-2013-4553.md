The XEN_DOMCTL_getmemlist hypercall in Xen 3.4.x through 4.3.x (possibly 4.3.1) does not always obtain the page_alloc_lock and mm_rwlock in the same order, which allows local guest administrators to cause a denial of service (host deadlock).

### CVSS Score: **5.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | ADJACENT_NETWORK |
