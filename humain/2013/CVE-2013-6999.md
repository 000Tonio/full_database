# CVE-2013-6999

- Published: 2013-12-07T01:55:00

** DISPUTED ** The IsHandleEntrySecure function in win32k.sys in the kernel-mode drivers in Microsoft Windows Server 2008 SP2 does not properly validate the tagPROCESSINFO pW32Job field, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a crafted NtUserValidateHandleSecure call for an owned object.  NOTE: the vendor reportedly disputes the significance of this report, stating that "it appears to be a local DOS ... we don't consider it a security vulnerability." Per: http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html

"CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference"

### CVSS Score: **4**
