The gpg_ctx_add_recipient function in camel/camel-gpg-context.c in GNOME Evolution 3.8.4 and earlier and Evolution Data Server 3.9.5 and earlier does not properly select the GPG key to use for email encryption, which might cause the email to be encrypted with the wrong key and allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information.
