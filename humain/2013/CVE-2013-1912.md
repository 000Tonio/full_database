Buffer overflow in HAProxy 1.4 through 1.4.22 and 1.5-dev through 1.5-dev17, when HTTP keep-alive is enabled, using HTTP keywords in TCP inspection rules, and running with rewrite rules that appends to requests, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted pipelined HTTP requests that prevent request realignment from occurring.

### CVSS Score: **5.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
