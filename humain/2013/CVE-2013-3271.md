# CVE-2013-3271

- Published: 2013-08-28T13:13:00

- Modified: 2013-10-07T17:56:00

EMC RSA Authentication Agent for PAM 7.0 before 7.0.2.1 enforces the maximum number of login attempts within the PAM-enabled application codebase, instead of within the Agent codebase, which makes it easier for remote attackers to discover correct login credentials via a brute-force attack.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
