# CVE-2013-1711

- Published: 2013-08-07T01:55:00

The XrayWrapper implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 23.0 and SeaMonkey before 2.20 does not properly address the possibility of an XBL scope bypass resulting from non-native arguments in XBL function calls, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by leveraging access to an unprivileged object.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
