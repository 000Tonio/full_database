- Published: 2013-10-24T03:48:00

- Modified: 2013-10-24T15:09:00

The kernel in Apple Mac OS X before 10.9 does not properly determine the output length for SHA-2 digest function calls, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) by triggering a digest operation, as demonstrated by an IPSec connection.
