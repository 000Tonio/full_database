# CVE-2013-1957

- Published: 2013-04-24T19:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:42:00

The clone_mnt function in fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel before 3.8.6 does not properly restrict changes to the MNT_READONLY flag, which allows local users to bypass an intended read-only property of a filesystem by leveraging a separate mount namespace.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
