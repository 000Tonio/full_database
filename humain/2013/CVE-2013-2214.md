# CVE-2013-2214

- Published: 2014-02-10T23:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:43:00

status.cgi in Nagios 4.0 before 4.0 beta4 and 3.x before 3.5.1 does not properly restrict access to certain users that are a contact for a service, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information about hostnames via the servicegroup (1) overview, (2) summary, or (3) grid style in status.cgi. NOTE: this behavior is by design in most 3.x versions, but the upstream vendor "decided to change it for Nagios 4" and 3.5.1.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
