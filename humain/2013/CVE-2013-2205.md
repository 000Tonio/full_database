The default configuration of SWFUpload in WordPress before 3.5.2 has an unrestrictive security.allowDomain setting, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a crafted web site.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
