# CVE-2013-7449

- Published: 2016-04-21T14:59:00

- Modified: 2021-07-20T14:36:00

The ssl_do_connect function in common/server.c in HexChat before 2.10.2, XChat, and XChat-GNOME does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
