The installation routine in ownCloud Server before 4.0.14, 4.5.x before 4.5.9, and 5.0.x before 5.0.4 uses the time function to seed the generation of the PostgreSQL database user password, which makes it easier for remote attackers to guess the password via a brute force attack.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |
