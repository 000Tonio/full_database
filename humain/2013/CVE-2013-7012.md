# CVE-2013-7012

- Published: 2013-12-09T16:36:00

- Modified: 2016-12-03T03:00:00

The get_siz function in libavcodec/jpeg2000dec.c in FFmpeg before 2.1 does not prevent attempts to use non-zero image offsets, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JPEG2000 data.
