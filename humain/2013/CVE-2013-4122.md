# CVE-2013-4122

- Published: 2013-10-27T00:55:00

- Modified: 2016-12-08T03:03:00

Cyrus SASL 2.1.23, 2.1.26, and earlier does not properly handle when a NULL value is returned upon an error by the crypt function as implemented in glibc 2.17 and later, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (thread crash and consumption) via (1) an invalid salt or, when FIPS-140 is enabled, a (2) DES or (3) MD5 encrypted password, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
