- Published: 2013-02-03T01:55:00

The dissect_pw_eth_heuristic function in epan/dissectors/packet-pw-eth.c in Wireshark 1.6.x before 1.6.13 and 1.8.x before 1.8.5 does not properly handle apparent Ethernet address values at the beginning of MPLS data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (loop) via a malformed packet.

### CVSS Score: **2.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
