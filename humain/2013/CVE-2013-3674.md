# CVE-2013-3674

- Published: 2013-06-10T03:19:00

- Modified: 2015-10-28T01:23:00

The cdg_decode_frame function in cdgraphics.c in libavcodec in FFmpeg before 1.2.1 does not validate the presence of non-header data in a buffer, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access and application crash) via crafted CD Graphics Video data.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
