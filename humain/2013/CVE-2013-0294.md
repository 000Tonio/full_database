- Published: 2020-01-28T16:15:00

packet.py in pyrad before 2.1 uses weak random numbers to generate RADIUS authenticators and hash passwords, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a brute force attack.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
