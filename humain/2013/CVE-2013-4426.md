pyxtrlock before 0.1 uses an incorrect variable name, which allows physically proximate attackers to bypass the lock screen via multiple failed authentication attempts, which trigger a crash.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
