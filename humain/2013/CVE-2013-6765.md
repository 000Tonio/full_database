# CVE-2013-6765

- Published: 2014-05-19T14:55:00

- Modified: 2014-05-19T19:03:00

OpenVAS Manager 3.0 before 3.0.7 and 4.0 before 4.0.4 allows remote attackers to bypass the OMP authentication restrictions and execute OMP commands via a crafted OMP request for version information, which causes the state to be set to CLIENT_AUTHENTIC, as demonstrated by the omp_xml_handle_end_element function in omp.c.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
