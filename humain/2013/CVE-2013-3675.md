- Published: 2013-06-10T03:19:00

- Modified: 2013-10-04T16:41:00

The process_frame_obj function in sanm.c in libavcodec in FFmpeg before 1.2.1 does not validate width and height values, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow, out-of-bounds array access, and application crash) via crafted LucasArts Smush video data.
