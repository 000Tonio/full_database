The Secure Pages module 6.x-2.x before 6.x-2.0 for Drupal does not properly match URLs, which causes HTTP to be used instead of HTTPS and makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a crafted web page.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
