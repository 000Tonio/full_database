# CVE-2013-4304

- Published: 2014-01-26T20:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:33:00

The CentralAuth extension for MediaWiki 1.19.x before 1.19.8, 1.20.x before 1.20.7, and 1.21.x before 1.21.2 caches a valid CentralAuthUser object in the centralauth_User cookie even when a user has not successfully logged in, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication without a password.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
