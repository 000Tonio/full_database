EMC RSA Authentication Agent 7.1.x before 7.1.2 on Windows does not enforce the Quick PIN Unlock timeout feature, which allows physically proximate attackers to bypass the passcode requirement for a screensaved session by entering a PIN after timeout expiration.

"Affected Products:

Product: RSA Authentication Agent for Microsoft Windows version 7.1 and 7.1.1
