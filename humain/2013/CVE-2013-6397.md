# CVE-2013-6397

- Published: 2013-12-07T20:55:00

Directory traversal vulnerability in SolrResourceLoader in Apache Solr before 4.6 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) or full pathname in the tr parameter to solr/select/, when the response writer (wt parameter) is set to XSLT. NOTE: this can be leveraged using a separate XXE (XML eXternal Entity) vulnerability to allow access to files across restricted network boundaries.
