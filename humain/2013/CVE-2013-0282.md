OpenStack Keystone Grizzly before 2013.1, Folsom 2012.1.3 and earlier, and Essex does not properly check if the (1) user, (2) tenant, or (3) domain is enabled when using EC2-style authentication, which allows context-dependent attackers to bypass access restrictions.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
