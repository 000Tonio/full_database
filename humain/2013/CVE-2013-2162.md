Race condition in the post-installation script (mysql-server-5.5.postinst) for MySQL Server 5.5 for Debian GNU/Linux and Ubuntu Linux creates a configuration file with world-readable permissions before restricting the permissions, which allows local users to read the file and obtain sensitive information such as credentials.
