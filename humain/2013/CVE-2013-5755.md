config/.htpasswd in Yealink IP Phone SIP-T38G has a hardcoded password of (1) user (s7C9Cx.rLsWFA) for the user account, (2) admin (uoCbM.VEiKQto) for the admin account, and (3) var (jhl3iZAe./qXM) for the var account, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **10**
