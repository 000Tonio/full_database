# CVE-2013-1633

- Published: 2013-08-06T02:52:00

- Modified: 2013-10-11T13:59:00

easy_install in setuptools before 0.7 uses HTTP to retrieve packages from the PyPI repository, and does not perform integrity checks on package contents, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted response to the default use of the product.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
