The Sponsorship Confirmation functionality in Aruba Networks ClearPass 5.x, 6.0.1, and 6.0.2, and Amigopod/ClearPass Guest 3.0 through 3.9.7, allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and approve a request by sending a guest request, then using "parameter manipulation" in conjunction with information from a "default holding page" to discover the link that is used for sponsor approval of the guest request, then performing a direct request to that link.
