# CVE-2013-4419

- Published: 2013-11-05T20:55:00

- Modified: 2018-12-13T17:57:00

The guestfish command in libguestfs 1.20.12, 1.22.7, and earlier, when using the --remote or --listen option, does not properly check the ownership of /tmp/.guestfish-$UID/ when creating a temporary socket file in this directory, which allows local users to write to the socket and execute arbitrary commands by creating /tmp/.guestfish-$UID/ in advance.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
