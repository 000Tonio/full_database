A certain Ubuntu build procedure for perf, as distributed in the Linux kernel packages in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, 12.04 LTS, 12.10, 13.04, and 13.10, sets the HOME environment variable to the ~buildd directory and consequently reads the system configuration file from the ~buildd directory, which allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging control over the buildd account.
