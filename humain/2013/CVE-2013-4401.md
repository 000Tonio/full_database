# CVE-2013-4401

- Published: 2013-11-02T18:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:46:00

The virConnectDomainXMLToNative API function in libvirt 1.1.0 through 1.1.3 checks for the connect:read permission instead of the connect:write permission, which allows attackers to gain domain:write privileges and execute Qemu binaries via crafted XML. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
