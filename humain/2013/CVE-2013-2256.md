OpenStack Compute (Nova) before 2013.1.3 and Havana before havana-2 does not properly enforce the os-flavor-access:is_public property, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information (flavor properties), boot arbitrary flavors, and possibly have other unspecified impacts by guessing the flavor id.

### CVSS Score: **6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
