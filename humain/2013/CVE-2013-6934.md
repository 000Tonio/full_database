# CVE-2013-6934

- Published: 2014-01-23T21:55:00

The parseRTSPRequestString function in Live Networks Live555 Streaming Media 2013.11.26, as used in VideoLAN VLC Media Player, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a space character at the beginning of an RTSP message, which triggers an integer underflow, infinite loop, and buffer overflow.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-6933.
