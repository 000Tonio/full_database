Xen 4.2.x and 4.1.x does not properly restrict access to IRQs, which allows local stub domain clients to gain access to IRQs and cause a denial of service via vectors related to "passed-through IRQs or PCI devices."

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
