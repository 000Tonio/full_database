The sctp_send_initiate_ack function in sys/netinet/sctp_output.c in the SCTP implementation in the kernel in FreeBSD 8.3 through 9.2-PRERELEASE does not properly initialize the state-cookie data structure, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory by reading packet data in INIT-ACK chunks.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |
