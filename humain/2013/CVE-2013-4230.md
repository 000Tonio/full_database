The mm_webform submodule in the Monster Menus module 6.x-6.x before 6.x-6.61 and 7.x-1.x before 7.x-1.13 for Drupal does not properly restrict access to webform submissions, which allows remote authenticated users with the "Who can read data submitted to this webform" permission to delete arbitrary submissions via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
