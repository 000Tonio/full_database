Off-by-one error in the process_cgivars function in contrib/daemonchk.c in Nagios Core 3.5.1, 4.0.2, and earlier allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information from process memory or cause a denial of service (crash) via a long string in the last key value in the variable list, which triggers a heap-based buffer over-read.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | PARTIAL |
