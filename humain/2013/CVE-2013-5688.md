Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in index.php in AjaXplorer 5.0.2 and earlier allow remote authenticated users to read arbitrary files via a ../%00 (dot dot backslash encoded null byte) in the file parameter in a (1) download or (2) get_content action, or (3) upload arbitrary files via a ../%00 (dot dot backslash encoded null byte) in the dir parameter in an upload action.
