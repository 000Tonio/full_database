Multiple buffer overflows in the (1) R5RS char-ready, (2) tcp-accept-ready, and (3) file-select procedures in Chicken through 4.8.0.3 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) by opening a file descriptor with a large integer value. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-6122.
