# CVE-2013-1080

- Published: 2013-03-29T16:09:00

- Modified: 2013-12-13T05:12:00

The web server in Novell ZENworks Configuration Management (ZCM) 10.3 and 11.2 before 11.2.4 does not properly perform authentication for zenworks/jsp/index.jsp, which allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks, and consequently upload and execute arbitrary programs, via a request to TCP port 443.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
