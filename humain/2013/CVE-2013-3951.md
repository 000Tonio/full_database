# CVE-2013-3951

- Published: 2013-06-05T14:39:00

- Modified: 2016-12-08T03:03:00

sys/openbsd/stack_protector.c in libc in Apple iOS 6.1.3 and Mac OS X 10.8.x does not properly parse the Apple strings employed in the user-space stack-cookie implementation, which allows local users to bypass cookie randomization by executing a program with a call-path beginning with the stack-guard= substring, as demonstrated by an iOS untethering attack or an attack against a setuid Mac OS X program.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
