# CVE-2013-6636

- Published: 2013-12-07T00:55:00

- Modified: 2014-03-06T04:49:00

The FrameLoader::notifyIfInitialDocumentAccessed function in core/loader/FrameLoader.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 31.0.1650.63, makes an incorrect check for an empty document during presentation of a modal dialog, which allows remote attackers to spoof the address bar via vectors involving the document.write method.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
