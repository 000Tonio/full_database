- Published: 2014-04-01T03:24:00

- Modified: 2016-12-31T02:59:00

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Gnew 2013.1 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) answer_id or (2) question_id parameter to polls/vote.php, (3) story_id parameter to comments/add.php or (4) comments/edit.php, or (5) thread_id parameter to posts/add.php.  NOTE: this issue was SPLIT due to differences in researchers and disclosure dates. CVE-2013-7349 already covers the news_id parameter to news/send.php, user_email parameter to users/register.php, and thread_id to posts/edit.php vectors.
