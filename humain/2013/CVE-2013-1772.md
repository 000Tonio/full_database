# CVE-2013-1772

- Published: 2013-02-28T19:55:00

- Modified: 2013-08-22T06:51:00

The log_prefix function in kernel/printk.c in the Linux kernel 3.x before 3.4.33 does not properly remove a prefix string from a syslog header, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and system crash) by leveraging /dev/kmsg write access and triggering a call_console_drivers function call.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
