Oracle Mojarra 2.2.x before 2.2.6 and 2.1.x before 2.1.28 does not perform appropriate encoding when a (1) <h:outputText> tag or (2) EL expression is used after a scriptor style block, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via application-specific vectors.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
