plugins/system/remember/remember.php in Joomla! 2.5.x before 2.5.10 and 3.0.x before 3.0.4 does not properly handle an object obtained by unserializing a cookie, which allows remote authenticated users to conduct PHP object injection attacks and cause a denial of service via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
