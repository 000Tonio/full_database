Microsoft Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012, when Hyper-V is used, does not ensure memory-address validity, which allows guest OS users to execute arbitrary code in all guest OS instances, and allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash), via a guest-to-host hypercall with a crafted function parameter, aka "Address Corruption Vulnerability."
