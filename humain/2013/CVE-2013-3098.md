Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in TRENDnet TEW-812DRU router with firmware before 1.0.9.0 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) change admin credentials in a request to setSysAdm.cgi, (2) enable remote management or (3) enable port forwarding in an Apply action to uapply.cgi, or (4) have unspecified impact via a request to setNTP.cgi.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
