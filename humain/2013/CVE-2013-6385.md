The form API in Drupal 6.x before 6.29 and 7.x before 7.24, when used with unspecified third-party modules, performs form validation even when CSRF validation has failed, which might allow remote attackers to trigger application-specific impacts such as arbitrary code execution via application-specific vectors.

### CVSS Score: **5.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |
