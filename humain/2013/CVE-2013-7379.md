# CVE-2013-7379

- Published: 2014-05-16T15:55:00

- Modified: 2014-05-16T17:55:00

The admin API in the tomato module before 0.0.6 for Node.js does not properly check the access key when it is set to a string, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a string in the access-key header that partially matches config.master.api.access_key.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
