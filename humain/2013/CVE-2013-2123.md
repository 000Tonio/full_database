# CVE-2013-2123

- Published: 2013-08-28T22:55:00

The Node access user reference module 6.x-3.x before 6.x-3.5 and 7.x-3.x before 7.x-3.10 for Drupal does not properly restrict access to content containing a user reference field when the author update/delete grants are enabled and the author's user account is deleted, which allows remote attackers to modify the content via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
