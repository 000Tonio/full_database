Samba 4.0.x before 4.0.11 and 4.1.x before 4.1.1, when LDAP or HTTP is provided over SSL, uses world-readable permissions for a private key, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading the key file, as demonstrated by access to the local filesystem on an AD domain controller.
