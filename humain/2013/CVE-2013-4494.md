Xen before 4.1.x, 4.2.x, and 4.3.x does not take the page_alloc_lock and grant_table.lock in the same order, which allows local guest administrators with access to multiple vcpus to cause a denial of service (host deadlock) via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **5.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
