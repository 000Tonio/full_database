# CVE-2013-4445

The json rendering functionality in the Context module 6.x-2.x before 6.x-3.2 and 7.x-3.x before 7.x-3.0 for Drupal uses Drupal's token scheme to restrict access to blocks, which makes it easier for remote authenticated users to guess the access token for a block by leveraging the token from a block to which the user has access.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
