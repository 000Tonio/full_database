# CVE-2013-4228

- Published: 2020-02-18T19:15:00

- Modified: 2020-02-26T19:43:00

The OG access fields (visibility fields) implementation in Organic Groups (OG) module 7.x-2.x before 7.x-2.3 for Drupal does not properly restrict access to private groups, which allows remote authenticated users to guess node IDs, subscribe to, and read the content of arbitrary private groups via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
