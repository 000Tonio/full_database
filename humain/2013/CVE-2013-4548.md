# CVE-2013-4548

- Published: 2013-11-08T15:55:00

- Modified: 2019-10-09T23:08:00

The mm_newkeys_from_blob function in monitor_wrap.c in sshd in OpenSSH 6.2 and 6.3, when an AES-GCM cipher is used, does not properly initialize memory for a MAC context data structure, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended ForceCommand and login-shell restrictions via packet data that provides a crafted callback address.

### CVSS Score: **6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
