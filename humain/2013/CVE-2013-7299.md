# CVE-2013-7299

- Published: 2014-01-26T20:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:34:00

framework/common/messageheaderparser.cpp in Tntnet before 2.2.1 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a header that ends in \n instead of \r\n, which prevents a null terminator from being added and causes Tntnet to include headers from other requests.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
