Integer overflow in the gdImageCrop function in ext/gd/gd.c in PHP 5.5.x before 5.5.9 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via an imagecrop function call with a large x dimension value, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
