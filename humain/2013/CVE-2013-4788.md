# CVE-2013-4788

- Published: 2013-10-04T17:55:00

- Modified: 2017-07-01T01:29:00

The PTR_MANGLE implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.4, 2.17, and earlier, and Embedded GLIBC (EGLIBC) does not initialize the random value for the pointer guard, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to control execution flow by leveraging a buffer-overflow vulnerability in an application and using the known zero value pointer guard to calculate a pointer address. Additional information that was taken into consideration while scoring:
