# CVE-2013-2030

- Published: 2013-12-27T01:55:00

- Modified: 2014-05-05T05:21:00

keystone/middleware/auth_token.py in OpenStack Nova Folsom, Grizzly, and Havana uses an insecure temporary directory for storing signing certificates, which allows local users to spoof servers by pre-creating this directory, which is reused by Nova, as demonstrated using /tmp/keystone-signing-nova on Fedora.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
