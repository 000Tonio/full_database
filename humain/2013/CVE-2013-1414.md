Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in Fortinet FortiOS on FortiGate firewall devices before 4.3.13 and 5.x before 5.0.2 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that modify (1) settings or (2) policies, or (3) restart the device via a rebootme action to system/maintenance/shutdown.
