# CVE-2013-4130

- Published: 2013-08-20T22:55:00

- Modified: 2014-01-24T04:35:00

The (1) red_channel_pipes_add_type and (2) red_channel_pipes_add_empty_msg functions in server/red_channel.c in SPICE before 0.12.4 do not properly perform ring loops, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (reachable assertion and server exit) by triggering a network error.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
