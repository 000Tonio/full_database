Xen 4.0.x and 4.1.x incorrectly releases a grant reference when releasing a non-v1, non-transitive grant, which allows local guest administrators to cause a denial of service (host crash), obtain sensitive information, or possibly have other impacts via unspecified vectors.

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |
