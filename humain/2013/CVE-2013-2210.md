Heap-based buffer overflow in the XML Signature Reference functionality in Apache Santuario XML Security for C++ (aka xml-security-c) before 1.7.2 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via malformed XPointer expressions. NOTE: this is due to an incorrect fix for CVE-2013-2154.
