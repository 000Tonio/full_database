- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:32:00

The MoveDisk command in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager (RHEV-M) 3.1 and earlier does not properly check permissions on storage domains, which allows remote authenticated storage admins to cause a denial of service (free space consumption of other storage domains) via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
