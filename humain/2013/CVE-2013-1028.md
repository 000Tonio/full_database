- Modified: 2013-09-27T03:43:00

The IPSec implementation in Apple Mac OS X before 10.8.5, when Hybrid Auth is used, does not verify X.509 certificates from security gateways, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof security gateways and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
