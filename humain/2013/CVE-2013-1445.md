# CVE-2013-1445

- Published: 2013-10-26T17:55:00

- Modified: 2013-10-28T15:14:00

The Crypto.Random.atfork function in PyCrypto before 2.6.1 does not properly reseed the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) before allowing a child process to access it, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging a race condition in which a child process is created and accesses the PRNG within the same rate-limit period as another process.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
