Buffer overflow in MostGear Soft Easy LAN Folder Share 3.2.0.100 allows local users to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long string in the (1) registration code field in the activate license window or the (2) HKLM\SOFTWARE\MostGear\EasyLanFolderShare_V1\License registry key. NOTE: it is not clear from the original report whether this issue crosses privilege boundaries.  If not, then it should not be included in CVE.
