# CVE-2013-6412

- Published: 2014-01-23T00:55:00

- Modified: 2014-01-23T17:55:00

The transform_save function in transform.c in Augeas 1.0.0 through 1.1.0 does not properly calculate the permission values when the umask contains a "7," which causes world-writable permissions to be used for new files and allows local users to modify the files via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
