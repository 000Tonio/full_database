# CVE-2013-5414

- Published: 2013-11-18T05:23:00

The migration functionality in IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) 7.0 before 7.0.0.31, 8.0 before 8.0.0.8, and 8.5 before 8.5.5.1 does not properly support the distinction between the admin role and the adminsecmanager role, which allows remote authenticated users to gain privileges in opportunistic circumstances by accessing resources in between a migration and a role evaluation.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
