The Google Authenticator login module 6.x-1.x before 6.x-1.2 and 7.x-1.x before 7.x-1.4 for Drupal does not properly identify user account names, which might allow remote attackers to bypass the two-factor authentication requirement via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
