The Authenticated User Page Caching (Authcache) module 7.x-1.x before 7.x-1.5 for Drupal does not properly restrict access to cached pages, which allows remote attackers with the same role-combination as the superuser to obtain sensitive information via the cached pages of the superuser.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
