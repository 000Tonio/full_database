# CVE-2013-0209

- Published: 2013-01-23T01:55:00

- Modified: 2013-01-29T05:00:00

lib/MT/Upgrade.pm in mt-upgrade.cgi in Movable Type 4.2x and 4.3x through 4.38 does not require authentication for requests to database-migration functions, which allows remote attackers to conduct eval injection and SQL injection attacks via crafted parameters, as demonstrated by an eval injection attack against the core_drop_meta_for_table function, leading to execution of arbitrary Perl code.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
