The VTY authentication implementation in Cisco IOS XE 03.02.xxSE and 03.03.xxSE incorrectly relies on the Linux-IOS internal-network configuration, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by leveraging access to a 192.168.x.2 source IP address, aka Bug ID CSCuj90227.

### CVSS Score: **5.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
