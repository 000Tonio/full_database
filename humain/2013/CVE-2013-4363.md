- Published: 2013-10-17T23:55:00

- Modified: 2017-12-09T02:29:00

Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in Gem::Version::ANCHORED_VERSION_PATTERN in lib/rubygems/version.rb in RubyGems before 1.8.23.2, 1.8.24 through 1.8.26, 2.0.x before 2.0.10, and 2.1.x before 2.1.5, as used in Ruby 1.9.0 through 2.0.0p247, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted gem version that triggers a large amount of backtracking in a regular expression.  NOTE: this issue is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-4287.
