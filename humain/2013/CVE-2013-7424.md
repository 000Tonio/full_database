The getaddrinfo function in glibc before 2.15, when compiled with libidn and the AI_IDN flag is used, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid free) and possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors, as demonstrated by an internationalized domain name to ping6.

### CVSS Score: **5.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
