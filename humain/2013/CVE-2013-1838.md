- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:33:00

OpenStack Compute (Nova) Grizzly, Folsom (2012.2), and Essex (2012.1) does not properly implement a quota for fixed IPs, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion and failure to spawn new instances) via a large number of calls to the addFixedIp function. Per http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-1771-1/
"A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

Ubuntu 12.10
Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
Ubuntu 11.10"

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
