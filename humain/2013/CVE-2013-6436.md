# CVE-2013-6436

- Published: 2014-01-07T19:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:29:00

The lxcDomainGetMemoryParameters method in lxc/lxc_driver.c in libvirt 1.0.5 through 1.2.0 does not properly check the status of LXC guests when reading memory tunables, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and libvirtd crash) via a guest in the shutdown status, as demonstrated by the "virsh memtune" command.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
