IBM InfoSphere Optim Data Growth for Oracle E-Business Suite 6.x, 7.x, and 9.x before 9.1.0.3 relies on the MD5 algorithm for signatures in X.509 certificates, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a crafted certificate.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
