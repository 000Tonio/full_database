- Published: 2013-10-17T23:55:00

The outs instruction emulation in Xen 3.1.x, 4.2.x, 4.3.x, and earlier, when using FS: or GS: segment override, uses an uninitialized variable as a segment base, which allows local 64-bit PV guests to obtain sensitive information (hypervisor stack content) via unspecified vectors related to stale data in a segment register.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
