# CVE-2013-4737

- Published: 2014-02-15T14:57:00

- Modified: 2014-02-18T19:35:00

The CONFIG_STRICT_MEMORY_RWX implementation for the Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and other products, does not properly consider certain memory sections, which makes it easier for attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the presence of RWX memory at a fixed location.
