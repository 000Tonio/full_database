net/socket/ssl_client_socket_nss.cc in the TLS implementation in Google Chrome before 31.0.1650.48 does not ensure that a server's X.509 certificate is the same during renegotiation as it was before renegotiation, which might allow remote web servers to interfere with trust relationships by renegotiating a session.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
