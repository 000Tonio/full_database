- Published: 2013-10-01T20:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:41:00

MongoDB before 2.0.9 and 2.2.x before 2.2.4 does not properly validate requests to the nativeHelper function in SpiderMonkey, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (invalid memory access and server crash) or execute arbitrary code via a crafted memory address in the first argument.

### CVSS Score: **6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
