# CVE-2013-0655

- Published: 2013-01-21T16:55:00

- Modified: 2013-01-22T05:00:00

The client in Schneider Electric Software Update (SESU) Utility 1.0.x and 1.1.x does not ensure that updates have a valid origin, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof updates, and consequently execute arbitrary code, by modifying the data stream on TCP port 80.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
