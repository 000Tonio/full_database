# CVE-2013-3954

- Published: 2013-06-05T14:39:00

- Modified: 2013-10-31T03:34:00

The posix_spawn system call in the XNU kernel in Apple Mac OS X 10.8.x does not properly validate the data for file actions and port actions, which allows local users to (1) cause a denial of service (panic) via a size value that is inconsistent with a header count field, or (2) obtain sensitive information from kernel heap memory via a certain size value in conjunction with a crafted buffer.

### CVSS Score: **6.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
