- Published: 2013-10-11T22:55:00

- Modified: 2021-07-15T19:15:00

The policy definition evaluator in Condor 7.5.4, 8.0.0, and earlier does not properly handle attributes in a (1) PREEMPT, (2) SUSPEND, (3) CONTINUE, (4) WANT_VACATE, or (5) KILL policy that evaluate to an Unconfigured, Undefined, or Error state, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (condor_startd exit) via a crafted job.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
