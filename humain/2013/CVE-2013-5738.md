# CVE-2013-5738

- Published: 2013-09-12T13:30:00

- Modified: 2013-09-27T03:47:00

The get_allowed_mime_types function in wp-includes/functions.php in WordPress before 3.6.1 does not require the unfiltered_html capability for uploads of .htm and .html files, which might make it easier for remote authenticated users to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a crafted file.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
