Certain getText methods in the ActionSupport controller in Apache Roller before 5.0.2 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary OGNL expressions via the first or second parameter, as demonstrated by the pageTitle parameter in the !getPageTitle sub-URL to roller-ui/login.rol, which uses a subclass of UIAction, aka "OGNL Injection."
