- Published: 2013-03-13T00:55:00

- Modified: 2020-09-28T12:58:00

The USB kernel-mode drivers in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2, R2, and R2 SP1, Windows 7 Gold and SP1, Windows 8, and Windows Server 2012 do not properly handle objects in memory, which allows physically proximate attackers to execute arbitrary code by connecting a crafted USB device, aka "Windows USB Descriptor Vulnerability," a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-1286 and CVE-2013-1287.
