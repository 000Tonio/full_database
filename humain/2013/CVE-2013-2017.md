The veth (aka virtual Ethernet) driver in the Linux kernel before 2.6.34 does not properly manage skbs during congestion, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) by leveraging lack of skb consumption in conjunction with a double-free error.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
