Gnome Online Accounts (GOA) 3.4.x, 3.6.x before 3.6.3, and 3.7.x before 3.7.5, does not properly validate SSL certificates when creating accounts such as Windows Live and Facebook accounts, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain sensitive information such as credentials by sniffing the network. Per http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-1779-1/
"A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:
    Ubuntu 12.10
    Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
    Ubuntu 11.10"
