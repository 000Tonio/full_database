- Published: 2013-09-23T20:55:00

The sendfile system-call implementation in sys/kern/uipc_syscalls.c in the kernel in FreeBSD 9.2-RC1 and 9.2-RC2 does not properly pad transmissions, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information (kernel memory) via a length greater than the length of the file.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
