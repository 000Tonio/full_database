Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the client in Novell GroupWise through 8.0.3 HP3, and 2012 through SP2, on Windows allows user-assisted remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the body of an e-mail message. Per: http://www.novell.com/support/kb/doc.php?id=7012063

'Previous versions (GroupWise, 6.5, 7.x) of the GroupWise Client for Windows are likely also vulnerable but are no longer supported. Customers on earlier versions of GroupWise should, at a minimum, upgrade their GroupWise Windows clients to version 8.0.3 Hot Patch 3 or 2012 SP2 in order to secure their systems.'
