Multiple unrestricted file upload vulnerabilities in (1) media-upload.php, (2) media-upload-lncthumb.php, and (3) media-upload-sq_button.php in lib/admin/ in the OptimizePress theme before 1.61 for WordPress allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by uploading a file with an executable extension, then accessing it via a direct request to the file in images_comingsoon, images_lncthumbs, or images_optbuttons in wp-content/uploads/optpress/, as exploited in the wild in November 2013.
