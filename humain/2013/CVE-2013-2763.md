** DISPUTED ** The Schneider Electric M340 PLC modules allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: the vendor reportedly disputes this issue because it "could not be duplicated" and "an attacker could not remotely exploit this observed behavior to deny PLC control functions."

### CVSS Score: **5**
