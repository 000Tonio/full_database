# CVE-2013-4729

- Published: 2013-07-04T14:33:00

- Modified: 2013-07-05T04:00:00

import.php in phpMyAdmin 4.x before 4.0.4.1 does not properly restrict the ability of input data to specify a file format, which allows remote authenticated users to modify the GLOBALS superglobal array, and consequently change the configuration, via a crafted request.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
