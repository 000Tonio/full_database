IBM WebSphere Portal 7.0.0.x before 7.0.0.2 CF26 and 8.0.0.x before 8.0.0.1 CF09 does not properly handle content-selection changes during Taxonomy component rendering, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive property information in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging an error in a Web Content Manager (WCM) context processor.
