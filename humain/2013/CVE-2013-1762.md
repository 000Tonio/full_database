stunnel 4.21 through 4.54, when CONNECT protocol negotiation and NTLM authentication are enabled, does not correctly perform integer conversion, which allows remote proxy servers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted request that triggers a buffer overflow.

### CVSS Score: **6.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
