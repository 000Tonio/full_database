# CVE-2013-4458

- Published: 2013-12-12T18:55:00

Stack-based buffer overflow in the getaddrinfo function in sysdeps/posix/getaddrinfo.c in GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.18 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a (1) hostname or (2) IP address that triggers a large number of AF_INET6 address results. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-1914.
