The SecureSphere Operations Manager (SOM) Management Server in Imperva SecureSphere 9.0.0.5 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via (1) a direct request to dwr/call/plaincall/AsyncOperationsContainer.getOperationState.dwr, which reveals the installation path in the s0.filePath field, or (2) a T/keyManagement request to plain/settings.html, which reveals a temporary path in an error message.
