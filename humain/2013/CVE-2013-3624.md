The OS deployment feature in Baramundi Management Suite 7.5 through 8.9 stores credentials in cleartext on deployed machines, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading a file. NOTE: this ID was also incorrectly mapped to a separate issue in Oracle Outside In, but the correct ID for that issue is CVE-2013-5763.
