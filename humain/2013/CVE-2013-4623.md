# CVE-2013-4623

- Published: 2013-09-30T22:55:00

- Modified: 2013-10-31T03:35:00

The x509parse_crt function in x509.h in PolarSSL 1.1.x before 1.1.7 and 1.2.x before 1.2.8 does not properly parse certificate messages during the SSL/TLS handshake, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and CPU consumption) via a certificate message that contains a PEM encoded certificate.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
