# CVE-2013-4616

- Published: 2013-06-18T14:55:00

The WifiPasswordController generateDefaultPassword method in Preferences in Apple iOS 6 and earlier relies on the UITextChecker suggestWordInLanguage method for selection of Wi-Fi hotspot WPA2 PSK passphrases, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access via a brute-force attack that leverages the insufficient number of possible passphrases.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
