Buffer overflow in the Python bindings for the xc_vcpu_setaffinity call in Xen 4.0.x, 4.1.x, and 4.2.x allows local administrators with permissions to configure VCPU affinity to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and xend toolstack crash) and possibly gain privileges via a crafted cpumap.
