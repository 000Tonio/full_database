# CVE-2013-6437

- Published: 2014-03-06T15:55:00

- Modified: 2018-11-16T14:55:00

The libvirt driver in OpenStack Compute (Nova) before 2013.2.2 and icehouse before icehouse-2 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (disk consumption) by creating and deleting instances with unique os_type settings, which triggers the creation of a new ephemeral disk backing file.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
