importbuddy.php in the BackupBuddy plugin 1.3.4, 2.1.4, 2.2.25, 2.2.28, and 2.2.4 for WordPress does not require that authentication be enabled, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information, or overwrite or delete files, via vectors involving a (1) direct request, (2) step=1 request, (3) step=2 or step=3 request, or (4) step=7 request.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
