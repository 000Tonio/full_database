The evm_update_evmxattr function in security/integrity/evm/evm_crypto.c in the Linux kernel before 3.7.5, when the Extended Verification Module (EVM) is enabled, allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via an attempted removexattr operation on an inode of a sockfs filesystem.
