MediaWiki before 1.19.6 and 1.20.x before 1.20.5 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, as demonstrated by a CDATA section containing valid UTF-7 encoded sequences in a SVG file, which is then incorrectly interpreted as UTF-8 by Chrome and Firefox.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
