# CVE-2013-1579

- Published: 2013-02-03T01:55:00

- Modified: 2017-09-19T01:36:00

The rtps_util_add_bitmap function in epan/dissectors/packet-rtps.c in the RTPS dissector in Wireshark 1.6.x before 1.6.13 and 1.8.x before 1.8.5 does not properly implement certain nested loops for processing bitmap data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a malformed packet.

### CVSS Score: **2.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
