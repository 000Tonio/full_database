# CVE-2013-2104

- Published: 2014-01-21T18:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:42:00

python-keystoneclient before 0.2.4, as used in OpenStack Keystone (Folsom), does not properly check expiry for PKI tokens, which allows remote authenticated users to (1) retain use of a token after it has expired, or (2) use a revoked token once it expires.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
