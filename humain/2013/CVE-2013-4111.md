# CVE-2013-4111

- Published: 2013-08-28T21:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:44:00

The Python client library for Glance (python-glanceclient) before 0.10.0 does not properly check the preverify_ok value, which prevents the server hostname from being verified with a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate and allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
