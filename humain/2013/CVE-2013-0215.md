oxenstored in Xen 4.1.x, Xen 4.2.x, and xen-unstable does not properly consider the state of the Xenstore ring during read operations, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash and host-control outage, or memory consumption) or obtain sensitive control-plane data by leveraging guest administrative access.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
