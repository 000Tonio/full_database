The get_xattrinfo function in the XNU kernel in Apple iOS 5.x and 6.x through 6.1.3 on iPad devices does not properly validate the header of an AppleDouble file, which might allow local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or have unspecified other impact via an invalid file on an msdosfs filesystem.
