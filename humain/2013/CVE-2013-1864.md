- Published: 2014-05-23T14:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:33:00

The Portable Tool Library (aka PTLib) before 2.10.10, as used in Ekiga before 4.0.1, does not properly detect recursion during entity expansion, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) via a crafted PXML document containing a large number of nested entity references, aka a "billion laughs attack."

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
