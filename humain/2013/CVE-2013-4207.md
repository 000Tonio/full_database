Buffer overflow in sshbn.c in PuTTY before 0.63 allows remote SSH servers to cause a denial of service (crash) via an invalid DSA signature that is not properly handled during computation of a modular inverse and triggers the overflow during a division by zero by the bignum functionality, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-4206.
