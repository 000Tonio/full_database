The OSPF implementation on HP JD9##A routers; HP J4###A, J484#B, J8###A, JD3##A, JE###A, and JF55#A switches; HP 3COM routers and switches; and HP H3C routers and switches does not consider the possibility of duplicate Link State ID values in Link State Advertisement (LSA) packets before performing operations on the LSA database, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (routing disruption) or obtain sensitive packet information via a crafted LSA packet, a related issue to CVE-2013-0149.
