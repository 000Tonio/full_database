The kernel in Microsoft Windows XP SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2, Windows 7 SP1, and Windows 8 on 32-bit platforms does not properly handle unspecified page-fault system calls, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a crafted application, aka "Kernel Information Disclosure Vulnerability."
