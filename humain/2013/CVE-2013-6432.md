# CVE-2013-6432

- Published: 2013-12-09T18:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:49:00

The ping_recvmsg function in net/ipv4/ping.c in the Linux kernel before 3.12.4 does not properly interact with read system calls on ping sockets, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) by leveraging unspecified privileges to execute a crafted application.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
