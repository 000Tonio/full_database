# CVE-2013-2171

The vm_map_lookup function in sys/vm/vm_map.c in the mmap implementation in the kernel in FreeBSD 9.0 through 9.1-RELEASE-p4 does not properly determine whether a task should have write access to a memory location, which allows local users to bypass filesystem write permissions and consequently gain privileges via a crafted application that leverages read permissions, and makes mmap and ptrace system calls.
