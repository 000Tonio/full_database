Salt (aka SaltStack) before 0.17.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary YAML code via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: the vendor states that this might not be a vulnerability because the YAML to be loaded has already been determined to be safe.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
