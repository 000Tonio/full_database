main/http.c in the HTTP server in Asterisk Open Source 1.8.x before 1.8.20.2, 10.x before 10.12.2, and 11.x before 11.2.2; Certified Asterisk 1.8.15 before 1.8.15-cert2; and Asterisk Digiumphones 10.x-digiumphones before 10.12.2-digiumphones does not properly restrict Content-Length values, which allows remote attackers to conduct stack-consumption attacks and cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted HTTP POST request.
