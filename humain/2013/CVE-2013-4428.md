OpenStack Image Registry and Delivery Service (Glance) Folsom, Grizzly before 2013.1.4, and Havana before 2013.2, when the download_image policy is configured, does not properly restrict access to cached images, which allows remote authenticated users to read otherwise restricted images via an image UUID.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
