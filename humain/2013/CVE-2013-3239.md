# CVE-2013-3239

- Published: 2013-04-26T03:34:00

- Modified: 2013-11-19T04:48:00

phpMyAdmin 3.5.x before 3.5.8 and 4.x before 4.0.0-rc3, when a SaveDir directory is configured, allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code by using a double extension in the filename of an export file, leading to interpretation of this file as an executable file by the Apache HTTP Server, as demonstrated by a .php.sql filename.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
