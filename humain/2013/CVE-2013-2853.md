# CVE-2013-2853

- Published: 2013-07-10T10:55:00

- Modified: 2017-09-19T01:36:00

The HTTPS implementation in Google Chrome before 28.0.1500.71 does not ensure that headers are terminated by \r\n\r\n (carriage return, newline, carriage return, newline), which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to have an unspecified impact via vectors that trigger header truncation.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
