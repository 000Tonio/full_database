# CVE-2013-2190

- Published: 2013-10-17T23:55:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

The translate_hierarchy_event function in x11/clutter-device-manager-xi2.c in Clutter, when resuming the system, does not properly handle XIQueryDevice errors when a device has "disappeared," which causes the gnome-shell to crash and allows physically proximate attackers to access the previous gnome-shell session via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
