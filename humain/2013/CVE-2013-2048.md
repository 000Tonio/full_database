ownCloud before 5.0.6 does not properly check permissions, which allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary API commands via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: this can be leveraged using CSRF to allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary API commands.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
