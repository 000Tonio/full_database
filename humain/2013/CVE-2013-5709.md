- Published: 2013-09-17T12:04:00

- Modified: 2020-02-10T15:15:00

The authentication implementation in the web server on Siemens SCALANCE X-200 switches with firmware before 5.0.0 does not use a sufficient source of entropy for generating values of random numbers, which makes it easier for remote attackers to hijack sessions by predicting a value.

### CVSS Score: **8.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | COMPLETE |
