"1) PHP File Inclusion in Gnew: CVE-2013-5639

Vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input passed via the "gnew_language" cookie to "/users/login.php" script before using it in "include()" function. A remote attacker can include and execute arbitrary local files on a vulnerable system via directory traversal sequence and URL-encoded NULL byte.

The following exploitation example below displays content of the "/etc/passwd" file:

GET /users/login.php HTTP/1.1
Cookie: gnew_language=../../../etc/passwd%00;"
