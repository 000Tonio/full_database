# CVE-2013-5739

- Published: 2013-09-12T13:30:00

- Modified: 2013-09-27T03:47:00

The default configuration of WordPress before 3.6.1 does not prevent uploads of .swf and .exe files, which might make it easier for remote authenticated users to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a crafted file, related to the get_allowed_mime_types function in wp-includes/functions.php.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
