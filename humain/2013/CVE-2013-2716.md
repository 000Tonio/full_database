Puppet Labs Puppet Enterprise before 2.8.0 does not use a "randomized secret" in the CAS client config file (cas_client_config.yml) when upgrading from older 1.2.x or 2.0.x versions, which allows remote attackers to obtain console access via a crafted cookie.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
