Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the Wysija Newsletters plugin before 2.2.1 for WordPress allow remote authenticated administrators to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) search or (2) orderby parameter to wp-admin/admin.php.  NOTE: this can be leveraged using CSRF to allow remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
