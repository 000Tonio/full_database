# CVE-2013-1623

- Published: 2013-02-08T19:55:00

- Modified: 2014-02-21T04:58:00

The TLS and DTLS implementations in wolfSSL CyaSSL before 2.5.0 do not properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a noncompliant MAC check operation during the processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, a related issue to CVE-2013-0169.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
