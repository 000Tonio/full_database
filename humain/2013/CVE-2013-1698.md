The getUserMedia permission implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 22.0 references the URL of a top-level document instead of the URL of a specific page, which makes it easier for remote attackers to trick users into permitting camera or microphone access via a crafted web site that uses IFRAME elements.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
