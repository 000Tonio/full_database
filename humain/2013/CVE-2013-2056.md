The Inter-Satellite Sync (ISS) operation in Red Hat Network (RHN) Satellite 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5 does not properly check client "authenticity," which allows remote attackers to obtain channel content by skipping the initial authentication call.

| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
