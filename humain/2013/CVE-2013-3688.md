The TP-Link IP Cameras TL-SC3171, TL-SC3130, TL-SC3130G, TL-SC3171G, and possibly other models before beta firmware LM.1.6.18P12_sign6, does not properly restrict access to certain administrative functions, which allows remote attackers to (1) cause a denial of service (device reboot) via a request to cgi-bin/reboot or (2) cause a denial of service (reboot and reset to factory defaults) via a request to cgi-bin/hardfactorydefault.
