# CVE-2013-3238

- Published: 2013-04-26T03:34:00

- Modified: 2013-11-19T04:48:00

phpMyAdmin 3.5.x before 3.5.8 and 4.x before 4.0.0-rc3 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via a /e\x00 sequence, which is not properly handled before making a preg_replace function call within the "Replace table prefix" feature.

### CVSS Score: **6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
