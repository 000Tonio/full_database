The Birthday widget in the backend in Open-Xchange (OX) AppSuite 7.2.x before 7.2.2-rev25 and 7.4.x before 7.4.0-rev14, in certain user-id sharing scenarios, does not properly construct a SQL statement for next-year birthdays, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive birthday, displayname, firstname, and surname information via a birthdays action to api/contacts, aka bug 29315.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
