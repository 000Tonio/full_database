# CVE-2013-1618

- Published: 2013-02-08T19:55:00

The TLS implementation in Opera before 12.13 does not properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a MAC check operation during the processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, a related issue to CVE-2013-0169.
