# CVE-2013-1917

- Published: 2013-05-13T23:55:00

- Modified: 2014-04-19T04:34:00

Xen 3.1 through 4.x, when running 64-bit hosts on Intel CPUs, does not clear the NT flag when using an IRET after a SYSENTER instruction, which allows PV guest users to cause a denial of service (hypervisor crash) by triggering a #GP fault, which is not properly handled by another IRET instruction.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
