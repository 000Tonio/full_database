Google Chrome OS before 26.0.1410.57 relies on a Pango pango-utils.c read_config implementation that loads the contents of the .pangorc file in the user's home directory, and the file referenced by the PANGO_RC_FILE environment variable, which allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via crafted configuration data.
