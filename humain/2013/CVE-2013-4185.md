# CVE-2013-4185

- Published: 2013-10-29T22:55:00

- Modified: 2018-11-15T18:34:00

Algorithmic complexity vulnerability in OpenStack Compute (Nova) before 2013.1.3 and Havana before havana-3 does not properly handle network source security group policy updates, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (nova-network consumption) via a large number of server-creation operations, which triggers a large number of update requests.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
