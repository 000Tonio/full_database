# CVE-2013-2120

- Published: 2020-02-11T20:15:00

- Modified: 2020-02-21T16:15:00

The %{password(...)} macro in pastemacroexpander.cpp in the KDE Paste Applet before 4.10.5 in kdeplasma-addons does not properly generate passwords, which allows context-dependent attackers to bypass authentication via a brute-force attack.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
