Xen 4.1.x and 4.2.x, when the XSA-45 patch is in place, does not properly maintain references on pages stored for deferred cleanup, which allows local PV guest kernels to cause a denial of service (premature page free and hypervisor crash) or possibly gain privileges via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **7.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
