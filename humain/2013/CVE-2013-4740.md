goodix_tool.c in the Goodix gt915 touchscreen driver for the Linux kernel 3.x, as used in Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and other products, relies on user-space length values for kernel-memory copies of procfs file content, which allows attackers to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via an application that provides crafted values.
