The Risk Based Access functionality in IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager (TFIM) 6.2.2 before FP9 and Tivoli Federated Identity Manager Business Gateway (TFIMBG) 6.2.2 before FP9 does not prevent reuse of One Time Password (OTP) tokens, which makes it easier for remote authenticated users to complete transactions by leveraging access to an already-used token.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
