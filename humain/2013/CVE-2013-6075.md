- Published: 2013-11-02T18:55:00

- Modified: 2013-11-21T18:41:00

The compare_dn function in utils/identification.c in strongSwan 4.3.3 through 5.1.1 allows (1) remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read, NULL pointer dereference, and daemon crash) or (2) remote authenticated users to impersonate arbitrary users and bypass access restrictions via a crafted ID_DER_ASN1_DN ID, related to an "insufficient length check" during identity comparison. Per http://www.strongswan.org/blog/2013/11/01/strongswan-denial-of-service-vulnerability-%28cve-2013-6075%29.html

'Affected are strongSwan versions 4.3.3 and newer, up to 5.1.0.'
