mod/assign/locallib.php in the assignment module in Moodle 2.3.x before 2.3.7 and 2.4.x before 2.4.4 does not consider capability requirements during the processing of ZIP assignment-archive download (aka downloadall) requests, which allows remote authenticated users to read other users' assignments by leveraging the student role.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
