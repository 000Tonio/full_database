- Modified: 2014-03-08T05:11:00

Interaction error in OpenStack Nova and Neutron before Havana 2013.2.1 and icehouse-1 does not validate the instance ID of the tenant making a request, which allows remote tenants to obtain sensitive metadata by spoofing the device ID that is bound to a port, which is not properly handled by (1) api/metadata/handler.py in Nova and (2) the neutron-metadata-agent (agent/metadata/agent.py) in Neutron.

### CVSS Score: **5**
