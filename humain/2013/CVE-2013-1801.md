# CVE-2013-1801

- Published: 2013-04-09T20:55:00

- Modified: 2013-04-10T04:00:00

The httparty gem 0.9.0 and earlier for Ruby does not properly restrict casts of string values, which might allow remote attackers to conduct object-injection attacks and execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) by leveraging Action Pack support for YAML type conversion, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2013-0156.
