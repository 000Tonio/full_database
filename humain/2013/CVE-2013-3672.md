The mm_decode_inter function in mmvideo.c in libavcodec in FFmpeg before 1.2.1 does not validate the relationship between a horizontal coordinate and a width value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access and application crash) via crafted American Laser Games (ALG) MM Video data.
