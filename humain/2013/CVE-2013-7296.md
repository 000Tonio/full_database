# CVE-2013-7296

- Published: 2014-01-26T01:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:34:00

The JBIG2Stream::readSegments method in JBIG2Stream.cc in Poppler before 0.24.5 does not use the correct specifier within a format string, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault and application crash) via a crafted PDF file.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
