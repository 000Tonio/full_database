Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Outside In Technology component in Oracle Fusion Middleware 8.3.7 and 8.4 allows context-dependent attackers to affect availability via unknown vectors related to Outside In Filters, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-0393.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the January 2013 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from an independent researcher that this is a heap-based buffer overflow in the Paradox database stream filter (vspdx.dll) that can be triggered using a table header with a crafted "number of fields" value. Per: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpujan2013-1515902.html#AppendixFMW

'2. Outside In Technology is a suite of software development kits (SDKs). It does not have any particular associated protocol. If the hosting software passes data received over the network to Outside In Technology code, the CVSS score would increase to 6.8.'

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
