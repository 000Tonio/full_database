The administrative interface for Django 1.3.x before 1.3.6, 1.4.x before 1.4.4, and 1.5 before release candidate 2 does not check permissions for the history view, which allows remote authenticated administrators to obtain sensitive object history information. Per http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-1757-1/
"A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

    Ubuntu 12.10
    Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
    Ubuntu 11.10
    Ubuntu 10.04 LTS"
