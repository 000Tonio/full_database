Multiple CRLF injection vulnerabilities in Open-Xchange Server before 6.20.7 rev14, 6.22.0 before rev13, and 6.22.1 before rev14 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks via a crafted parameter, as demonstrated by (1) the location parameter to ajax/redirect or (2) multiple infostore URIs.
