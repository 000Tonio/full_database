Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 does not properly create policy requirements for custom Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) endpoint authentication in certain situations involving passwords over HTTPS, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by sending queries to an endpoint, aka "Authentication Bypass Vulnerability."

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
