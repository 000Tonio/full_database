- Published: 2013-09-30T21:55:00

- Modified: 2016-12-31T02:59:00

Integer overflow in kbdint.c in mod_sftp in ProFTPD 1.3.4d and 1.3.5r3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large response count value in an authentication request, which triggers a large memory allocation.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
