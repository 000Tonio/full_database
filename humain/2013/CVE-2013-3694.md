BlackBerry Link before 1.2.1.31 on Windows and before 1.1.1 build 39 on Mac OS X does not require authentication for remote file-access folders, which allows remote attackers to read or create arbitrary files via IPv6 WebDAV requests, as demonstrated by a CSRF attack involving DNS rebinding.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
