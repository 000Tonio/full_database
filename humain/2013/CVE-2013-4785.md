# CVE-2013-4785

- Published: 2013-07-08T22:55:00

- Modified: 2013-09-27T03:47:00

The web interface on the Dell iDRAC6 with firmware before 1.95 allows remote attackers to modify the CLP interface for arbitrary users and possibly have other impact via a request to an unspecified form that is accessible from testurls.html.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue, stating "DRAC's are intended to be on a separate management network; they are not designed nor intended to be placed on or connected to the Internet."
