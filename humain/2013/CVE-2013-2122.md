The Edit Limit module 7.x-1.x before 7.x-1.3 for Drupal does not properly restrict access to comments, which allows remote authenticated users with the "edit comments" permission to edit arbitrary comments of other users via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
