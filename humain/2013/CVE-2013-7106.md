# CVE-2013-7106

- Published: 2014-01-15T16:08:00

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in Icinga before 1.8.5, 1.9 before 1.9.4, and 1.10 before 1.10.2 allow remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long string to the (1) display_nav_table, (2) page_limit_selector, (3) print_export_link, or (4) page_num_selector function in cgi/cgiutils.c; (5) status_page_num_selector function in cgi/status.c; or (6) display_command_expansion function in cgi/config.c.  NOTE: this can be exploited without authentication by leveraging CVE-2013-7107.
