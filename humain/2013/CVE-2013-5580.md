# CVE-2013-5580

- Published: 2013-10-01T19:55:00

- Modified: 2013-10-02T17:18:00

The (1) Conn_StartLogin and (2) cb_Read_Resolver_Result functions in conn.c in ngIRCd 18 through 20.2, when the configuration option NoticeAuth is enabled, does not properly handle the return code for the Handle_Write function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and server crash) via unspecified vectors, related to a "notice auth" message not being sent to a new client.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
