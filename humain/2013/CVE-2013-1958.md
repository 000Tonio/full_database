# CVE-2013-1958

- Published: 2013-04-24T19:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:42:00

The scm_check_creds function in net/core/scm.c in the Linux kernel before 3.8.6 does not properly enforce capability requirements for controlling the PID value associated with a UNIX domain socket, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the time interval during which a user namespace has been created but a PID namespace has not been created.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
