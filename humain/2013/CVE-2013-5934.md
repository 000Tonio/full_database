Open-Xchange AppSuite 7.0.x before 7.0.2-rev15 and 7.2.x before 7.2.2-rev16 has a hardcoded password for node join operations, which allows remote attackers to expand a cluster by finding this password in the source code and then sending the password in a Hazelcast cluster API call, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-5200.
