# CVE-2013-4877

- Published: 2013-07-18T16:51:00

- Modified: 2013-08-22T06:54:00

The Verizon Wireless Network Extender SCS-26UC4 and SCS-2U01 does not use CAVE authentication, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain ESN and MIN values from arbitrary phones, and conduct cloning attacks, by sniffing the network for registration packets.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
