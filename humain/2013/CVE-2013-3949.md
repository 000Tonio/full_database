# CVE-2013-3949

- Published: 2013-06-05T14:39:00

- Modified: 2013-06-05T14:39:00

The posix_spawn system call in the XNU kernel in Apple Mac OS X 10.8.x does not prevent use of the _POSIX_SPAWN_DISABLE_ASLR and _POSIX_SPAWN_ALLOW_DATA_EXEC flags for setuid and setgid programs, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions via a wrapper program that calls the posix_spawnattr_setflags function.
