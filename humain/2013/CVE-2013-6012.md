Juniper Junos 12.1X44 before 12.1.X44-D20 and 12.1X45 before 12.1X45-D15, when the no-validate option is enabled, does not properly handle configuration validation errors during the config commit phase of the boot-up sequence, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **8.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
