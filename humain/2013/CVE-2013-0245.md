# CVE-2013-0245

- Published: 2013-07-16T18:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:33:00

The printer friendly version functionality in the Book module in Drupal 6.x before 6.28 and 7.x before 7.19 does not properly restrict access to node that are part of a book outline, which allows remote authenticated users with the "access printer-friendly version" permission to read node titles and possibly node content via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
