- Published: 2013-08-20T22:55:00

- Modified: 2013-10-31T03:34:00

OpenStack Swift before 1.9.1 in Folsom, Grizzly, and Havana allows authenticated users to cause a denial of service ("superfluous" tombstone consumption and Swift cluster slowdown) via a DELETE request with a timestamp that is older than expected.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
