# CVE-2013-4206

- Published: 2013-08-19T23:55:00

- Modified: 2021-08-06T16:58:00

Heap-based buffer underflow in the modmul function in sshbn.c in PuTTY before 0.63 allows remote SSH servers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly trigger memory corruption or code execution via a crafted DSA signature, which is not properly handled when performing certain bit-shifting operations during modular multiplication.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
