- Published: 2014-02-02T00:55:00

- Modified: 2014-06-21T04:36:00

The python-qpid client (common/rpc/impl_qpid.py) in OpenStack Oslo before 2013.2 does not enforce SSL connections when qpid_protocol is set to ssl, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network.
