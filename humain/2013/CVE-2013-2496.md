The msrle_decode_8_16_24_32 function in msrledec.c in libavcodec in FFmpeg through 1.1.3 does not properly determine certain end pointers, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted Microsoft RLE data.
