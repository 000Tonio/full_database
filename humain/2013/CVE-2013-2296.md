Walrus in Eucalyptus before 3.2.2 does not verify authorization for the GetBucketLoggingStatus, SetBucketLoggingStatus, and SetBucketVersioningStatus bucket operations, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended restrictions on (1) modifying the logging setting, (2) modifying the versioning setting, or (3) accessing activity logs via a request.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
