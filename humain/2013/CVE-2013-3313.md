The Loftek Nexus 543 IP Camera stores passwords in cleartext, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via an HTTP GET request to check_users.cgi. NOTE: cleartext passwords can also be obtained from proc/kcore when leveraging the directory traversal vulnerability in CVE-2013-3311.
