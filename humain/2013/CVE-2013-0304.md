# CVE-2013-0304

- Published: 2014-06-05T15:44:00

- Modified: 2014-06-05T17:28:00

ownCloud Server before 4.5.7 does not properly check ownership of calendars, which allows remote authenticated users to read arbitrary calendars via the calid parameter to /apps/calendar/export.php.  NOTE: this issue has been reported as a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability, but due to lack of details, it is uncertain what the root cause is.
