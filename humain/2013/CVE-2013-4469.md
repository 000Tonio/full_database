# CVE-2013-4469

- Published: 2013-11-02T18:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:46:00

OpenStack Compute (Nova) Folsom, Grizzly, and Havana, when use_cow_images is set to False, does not verify the virtual size of a QCOW2 image, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (host file system disk consumption) by transferring an image with a large virtual size that does not contain a large amount of data from Glance. NOTE: this issue is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-2096.
