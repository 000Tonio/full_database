Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in OpenX before 2.8.10 revision 82710 allow remote administrators to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in the group parameter to (1) plugin-preferences.php or (2) plugin-settings.php in www/admin, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-7376.  NOTE: this can be leveraged using CSRF to allow remote unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary files.
