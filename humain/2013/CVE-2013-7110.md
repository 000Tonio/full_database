# CVE-2013-7110

- Published: 2014-05-02T01:59:00

- Modified: 2014-05-02T14:52:00

Transifex command-line client before 0.10 does not validate X.509 certificates for data transfer connections, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof a Transifex server via an arbitrary certificate.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-2073.
