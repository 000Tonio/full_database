# CVE-2013-2276

- Published: 2013-02-27T16:55:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:25:00

The avcodec_decode_audio4 function in utils.c in libavcodec in FFmpeg before 1.1.3 does not verify the decoding state before proceeding with certain skip operations, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted audio data.
