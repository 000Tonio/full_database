The Flash plug-in in Google Chrome before 27.0.1453.116, as used on Google Chrome OS before 27.0.1453.116 and separately, does not properly determine whether a user wishes to permit camera or microphone access by a Flash application, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from a machine's physical environment via a clickjacking attack, as demonstrated by an attack using a crafted Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) opacity property.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
