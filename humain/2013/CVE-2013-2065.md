(1) DL and (2) Fiddle in Ruby 1.9 before 1.9.3 patchlevel 426, and 2.0 before 2.0.0 patchlevel 195, do not perform taint checking for native functions, which allows context-dependent attackers to bypass intended $SAFE level restrictions.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
