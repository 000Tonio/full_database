The AMD IOMMU support in Xen 4.2.x, 4.1.x, 3.3, and other versions, when using AMD-Vi for PCI passthrough, uses the same interrupt remapping table for the host and all guests, which allows guests to cause a denial of service by injecting an interrupt into other guests.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |
