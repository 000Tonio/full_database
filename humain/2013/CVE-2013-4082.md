The vwr_read function in wiretap/vwr.c in the Ixia IxVeriWave file parser in Wireshark 1.8.x before 1.8.8 does not validate the relationship between a record length and a trailer length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) via a crafted packet.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
