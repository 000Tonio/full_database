BlackBerry Link before 1.2.1.31 on Windows and before 1.1.1 build 39 on Mac OS X does not properly determine the user account for execution of Peer Manager in certain situations involving successive logins with different accounts, which allows context-dependent attackers to bypass intended restrictions on remote file-access folders via IPv6 WebDAV requests, a different vulnerability than CVE-2013-3694.
