The default configuration of Parallels Plesk Panel 9.0.x and 9.2.x on UNIX, and Small Business Panel 10.x on UNIX, has an improper ScriptAlias directive for phppath, which makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted request, a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-1823.
