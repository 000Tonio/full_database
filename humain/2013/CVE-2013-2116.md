# CVE-2013-2116

- Published: 2013-07-03T18:55:00

The _gnutls_ciphertext2compressed function in lib/gnutls_cipher.c in GnuTLS 2.12.23 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read and crash) via a crafted padding length. NOTE: this might be due to an incorrect fix for CVE-2013-0169.
