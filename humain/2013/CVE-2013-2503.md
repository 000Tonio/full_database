# CVE-2013-2503

- Published: 2013-03-11T17:55:00

- Modified: 2013-04-11T03:33:00

Privoxy before 3.0.21 does not properly handle Proxy-Authenticate and Proxy-Authorization headers in the client-server data stream, which makes it easier for remote HTTP servers to spoof the intended proxy service via a 407 (aka Proxy Authentication Required) HTTP status code.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
