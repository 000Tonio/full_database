KDE-Workspace 4.10.5 and earlier does not properly handle the return value of the glibc 2.17 crypt and pw_encrypt functions, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and crash) via (1) an invalid salt or a (2) DES or (3) MD5 encrypted password, when FIPS-140 is enable, to KDM or an (4) invalid password to KCheckPass.
