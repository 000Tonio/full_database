# CVE-2013-2254

- Published: 2013-10-17T23:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:33:00

The deepGetOrCreateNode function in impl/operations/AbstractCreateOperation.java in org.apache.sling.servlets.post.bundle 2.2.0 and 2.3.0 in Apache Sling does not properly handle a NULL value that returned when the session does not have permissions to the root node, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
