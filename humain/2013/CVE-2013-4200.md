# CVE-2013-4200

- Published: 2014-01-21T16:06:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:45:00

The isURLInPortal method in the URLTool class in in_portal.py in Plone 2.1 through 4.1, 4.2.x through 4.2.5, and 4.3.x through 4.3.1 treats URLs starting with a space as a relative URL, which allows remote attackers to bypass the allow_external_login_sites filtering property, redirect users to arbitrary web sites, and conduct phishing attacks via a space before a URL in the "next" parameter to acl_users/credentials_cookie_auth/require_login.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
