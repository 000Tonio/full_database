# CVE-2013-1897

- Published: 2013-05-13T23:55:00

- Modified: 2013-05-14T04:00:00

The do_search function in ldap/servers/slapd/search.c in 389 Directory Server 1.2.x before 1.2.11.20 and 1.3.x before 1.3.0.5 does not properly restrict access to entries when the nsslapd-allow-anonymous-access configuration is set to rootdse and the BASE search scope is used, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information outside of the rootDSE via a crafted LDAP search.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
