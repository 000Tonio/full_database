# CVE-2013-1858

- Published: 2013-04-05T21:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:41:00

The clone system-call implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.8.3 does not properly handle a combination of the CLONE_NEWUSER and CLONE_FS flags, which allows local users to gain privileges by calling chroot and leveraging the sharing of the / directory between a parent process and a child process.
