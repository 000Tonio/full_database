# CVE-2013-2224

- Published: 2013-07-04T21:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:43:00

A certain Red Hat patch for the Linux kernel 2.6.32 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 allows local users to cause a denial of service (invalid free operation and system crash) or possibly gain privileges via a sendmsg system call with the IP_RETOPTS option, as demonstrated by hemlock.c. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2012-3552.
