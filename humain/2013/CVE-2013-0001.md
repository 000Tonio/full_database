The Windows Forms (aka WinForms) component in Microsoft .NET Framework 1.0 SP3, 1.1 SP1, 2.0 SP2, 3.0 SP2, 4, and 4.5 does not properly initialize memory arrays, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via (1) a crafted XAML browser application (XBAP) or (2) a crafted .NET Framework application that leverages a pointer to an unmanaged memory location, aka "System Drawing Information Disclosure Vulnerability." Per http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms13-004 Microsoft .NET Framework 3.0 Service Pack 2 is not vulnerable.
