# CVE-2013-0179

- Published: 2014-01-13T21:55:00

- Modified: 2018-03-25T01:29:00

The process_bin_delete function in memcached.c in memcached 1.4.4 and other versions before 1.4.17, when running in verbose mode, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a request to delete a key, which does not account for the lack of a null terminator in the key and triggers a buffer over-read when printing to stderr.

### CVSS Score: **1.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
