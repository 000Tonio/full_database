# CVE-2013-6422

- Published: 2013-12-23T22:55:00

- Modified: 2016-04-07T20:55:00

The GnuTLS backend in libcurl 7.21.4 through 7.33.0, when disabling digital signature verification (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER), also disables the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST check for CN or SAN host name fields, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof servers and conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
