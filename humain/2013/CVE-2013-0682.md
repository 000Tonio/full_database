Cogent Real-Time Systems Cogent DataHub before 7.3.0, OPC DataHub before 6.4.22, Cascade DataHub before 6.4.22 on Windows, and DataHub QuickTrend before 7.3.0 do not properly handle exceptions, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via malformed data in a formatted text command, leading to out-of-bounds access to (1) heap or (2) stack memory.
