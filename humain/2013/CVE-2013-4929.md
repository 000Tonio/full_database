The parseFields function in epan/dissectors/packet-dis-pdus.c in the DIS dissector in Wireshark 1.8.x before 1.8.9 and 1.10.x before 1.10.1 does not terminate packet-data processing after finding zero remaining bytes, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (loop) via a crafted packet.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
