- Published: 2014-05-07T10:55:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

The qemuMigrationWaitForSpice function in qemu/qemu_migration.c in libvirt before 1.1.3 does not properly enter a monitor when performing seamless SPICE migration, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and libvirtd crash) by causing domblkstat to be called at the same time as the qemuMonitorGetSpiceMigrationStatus function. <a href="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html">CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference</a>
