- Published: 2014-01-24T18:55:00

- Modified: 2015-01-03T02:21:00

The libxlDomainGetNumaParameters function in the libxl driver (libxl/libxl_driver.c) in libvirt before 1.2.1 does not properly initialize the nodemap, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (invalid free operation and crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via an inactive domain to the virsh numatune command.
