# CVE-2013-5136

- Published: 2013-10-24T03:48:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:26:00

Apple Remote Desktop before 3.7 does not properly use server authentication-type information during decisions about whether to present an unencrypted-connection warning message, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information in opportunistic circumstances by sniffing the network during an unintended cleartext VNC session.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
