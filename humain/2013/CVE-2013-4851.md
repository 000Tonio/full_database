The vfs_hang_addrlist function in sys/kern/vfs_export.c in the NFS server implementation in the kernel in FreeBSD 8.3 and 9.x through 9.1-RELEASE-p5 controls authorization for host/subnet export entries on the basis of group information sent by the client, which allows remote attackers to bypass file permissions on NFS filesystems via crafted requests.
