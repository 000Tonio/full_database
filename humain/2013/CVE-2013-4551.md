Xen 4.2.x and 4.3.x, when nested virtualization is disabled, does not properly check the emulation paths for (1) VMLAUNCH and (2) VMRESUME, which allows local HVM guest users to cause a denial of service (host crash) via unspecified vectors related to "guest VMX instruction execution."

### CVSS Score: **5.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
