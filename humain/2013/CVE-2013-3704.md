# CVE-2013-3704

- Published: 2013-10-28T22:55:00

The RPM GPG key import and handling feature in libzypp 12.15.0 and earlier reports a different key fingerprint than the one used to sign a repository when multiple key blobs are used, which might allow remote attackers to trick users into believing that the repository was signed by a more-trustworthy key.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
