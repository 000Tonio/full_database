cgi-bin/iptablesgui.cgi in IPCop (aka IPCop Firewall) before 2.1.5 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via shell metacharacters in the TABLE parameter.  NOTE: this can be exploited remotely by leveraging a separate cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
