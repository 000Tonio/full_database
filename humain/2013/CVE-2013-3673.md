# CVE-2013-3673

- Published: 2013-06-10T03:19:00

- Modified: 2013-06-10T04:00:00

The gif_decode_frame function in gifdec.c in libavcodec in FFmpeg before 1.2.1 does not properly manage the disposal methods of frames, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access and application crash) via crafted GIF data.
