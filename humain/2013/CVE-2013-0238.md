- Published: 2013-02-13T01:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:33:00

The try_parse_v4_netmask function in hostmask.c in IRCD-Hybrid before 8.0.6 does not properly validate masks, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a mask that causes a negative number to be parsed.

### CVSS Score: **5**
