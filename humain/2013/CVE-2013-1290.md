Microsoft SharePoint Server 2013, in certain configurations involving legacy My Sites, does not properly establish default access controls for a SharePoint list, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended restrictions on reading list items via a direct request for a list's location, aka "Incorrect Access Rights Information Disclosure Vulnerability."

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
