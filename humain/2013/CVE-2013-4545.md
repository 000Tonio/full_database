# CVE-2013-4545

- Published: 2013-11-23T11:55:00

- Modified: 2016-06-17T01:59:00

cURL and libcurl 7.18.0 through 7.32.0, when built with OpenSSL, disables the certificate CN and SAN name field verification (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST) when the digital signature verification (CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER) is disabled, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
