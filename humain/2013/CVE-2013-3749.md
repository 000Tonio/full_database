Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Application Object Library component in Oracle E-Business Suite 11.5.10.2, 12.0.6, and 12.1.3 allows remote authenticated users to affect confidentiality via unknown vectors related to Logging.  NOTE: the previous information is from the July 2013 CPU. Oracle has not commented on claims from a third party that the issue is due to storage of credentials in the (1) FND_LOG_MESSAGES database table or (2) log files by "native login pages."
