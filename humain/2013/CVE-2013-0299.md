Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in ownCloud before 4.0.12 and 4.5.x before 4.5.7 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of users for requests that (1) change the timezone for the user via the lat and lng parameters to apps/calendar/ajax/settings/guesstimezone.php, (2) disable or enable the automatic timezone detection via the timezonedetection parameter to apps/calendar/ajax/settings/timezonedetection.php, (3) import user accounts via the admin_export parameter to apps/admin_migrate/settings.php, (4) overwrite user files via the operation parameter to apps/user_migrate/ajax/export.php, or (5) change the authentication server URL via unspecified vectors to apps/user_ldap/settings.php.
