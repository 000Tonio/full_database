# CVE-2013-4278

- Published: 2013-09-16T19:14:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:45:00

The "create an instance" API in OpenStack Compute (Nova) Folsom, Grizzly, and Havana does not properly enforce the os-flavor-access:is_public property, which allows remote authenticated users to boot arbitrary flavors by guessing the flavor id. NOTE: this issue is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-2256.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
