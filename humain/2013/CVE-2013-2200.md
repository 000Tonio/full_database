WordPress before 3.5.2 does not properly check the capabilities of roles, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended restrictions on publishing and authorship reassignment via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
