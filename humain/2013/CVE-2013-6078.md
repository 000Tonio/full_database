# CVE-2013-6078

- Published: 2014-06-17T15:55:00

- Modified: 2014-06-19T16:10:00

The default configuration of EMC RSA BSAFE Toolkits and RSA Data Protection Manager (DPM) 20130918 uses the Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generation (Dual_EC_DRBG) algorithm, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging unspecified "security concerns," aka the ESA-2013-068 issue.  NOTE: this issue has been SPLIT from CVE-2007-6755 because the vendor announcement did not state a specific technical rationale for a change in the algorithm; thus, CVE cannot reach a conclusion that a CVE-2007-6755 concern was the reason, or one of the reasons, for this change. As with CVE-2007-6755 this vulnerability has been scored with the assumption the relationship between P and Q is known to the attacker. Please see CVE-2007-6755 [link: http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2007-6755] more information.
