# CVE-2013-4852

- Published: 2013-08-19T23:55:00

- Modified: 2021-08-06T16:58:00

Integer overflow in PuTTY 0.62 and earlier, WinSCP before 5.1.6, and other products that use PuTTY allows remote SSH servers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code in certain applications that use PuTTY via a negative size value in an RSA key signature during the SSH handshake, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
