# CVE-2013-7020

- Published: 2013-12-09T16:36:00

- Modified: 2017-01-07T02:59:00

The read_header function in libavcodec/ffv1dec.c in FFmpeg before 2.1 does not properly enforce certain bit-count and colorspace constraints, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted FFV1 data.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
