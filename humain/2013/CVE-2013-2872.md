Google Chrome before 28.0.1500.71 on Mac OS X does not ensure a sufficient source of entropy for renderer processes, which might make it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms in third-party components via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
