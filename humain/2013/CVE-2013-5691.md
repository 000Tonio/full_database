# CVE-2013-5691

- Published: 2013-09-23T10:18:00

- Modified: 2013-10-24T03:48:00

The (1) IPv6 and (2) ATM ioctl request handlers in the kernel in FreeBSD 8.3 through 9.2-STABLE do not validate SIOCSIFADDR, SIOCSIFBRDADDR, SIOCSIFDSTADDR, and SIOCSIFNETMASK requests, which allows local users to perform link-layer actions, cause a denial of service (panic), or possibly gain privileges via a crafted application.

### CVSS Score: **6.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
