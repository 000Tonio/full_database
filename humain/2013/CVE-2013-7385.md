LiveZilla 5.1.2.1 and earlier includes the MD5 hash of the operator password in plaintext in Javascript code that is generated by lz/mobile/chat.php, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information and gain privileges by accessing the loginName and loginPassword variables using an independent cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7033.
