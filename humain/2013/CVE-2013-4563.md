# CVE-2013-4563

- Published: 2013-11-20T13:19:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:47:00

The udp6_ufo_fragment function in net/ipv6/udp_offload.c in the Linux kernel through 3.12, when UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) is enabled, does not properly perform a certain size comparison before inserting a fragment header, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) via a large IPv6 UDP packet, as demonstrated by use of the Token Bucket Filter (TBF) queueing discipline.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
