# CVE-2013-6442

- Published: 2014-03-14T10:55:00

The owner_set function in smbcacls.c in smbcacls in Samba 4.0.x before 4.0.16 and 4.1.x before 4.1.6 removes an ACL during use of a --chown or --chgrp option, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging an unintended administrative change.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
