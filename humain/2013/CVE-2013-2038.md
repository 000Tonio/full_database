# CVE-2013-2038

- Published: 2014-02-06T17:00:00

- Modified: 2014-02-07T15:24:00

The NMEA0183 driver in gpsd before 3.9 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon termination) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a GPS packet with a malformed $GPGGA interpreted sentence that lacks certain fields and a terminator.  NOTE: a separate issue in the AIS driver was also reported, but it might not be a vulnerability.
