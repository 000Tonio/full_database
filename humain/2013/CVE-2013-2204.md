moxieplayer.as in Moxiecode moxieplayer, as used in the TinyMCE Media plugin in WordPress before 3.5.2 and other products, does not consider the presence of a # (pound sign) character during extraction of the QUERY_STRING, which allows remote attackers to pass arbitrary parameters to a Flash application, and conduct content-spoofing attacks, via a crafted string after a ? (question mark) character.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
