The KCHARTXYLib.KChartXY ActiveX control in KChartXY.ocx before 65.30.30000.10002 in WellinTech KingView before 6.53 does not properly restrict SaveToFile method calls, which allows remote attackers to create or overwrite arbitrary files, and subsequently execute arbitrary programs, via the single pathname argument, as demonstrated by a directory traversal attack.
