# CVE-2008-1856

- Published: 2008-04-16T19:05:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:30:00

plugins/maps/db_handler.php in LinPHA 1.3.3 and earlier does not require authentication for a settings action that modifies the configuration file, which allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks and execute arbitrary local files by placing directory traversal sequences into the maps_type configuration setting, and then sending a request to maps_view.php, which causes plugins/maps/map.main.class.php to use the modified configuration.

### CVSS Score: **5.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
