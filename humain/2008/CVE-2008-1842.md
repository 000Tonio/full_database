Integer signedness error in ovspmd.exe in HP OpenView Network Node Manager (OV NNM) 8.01, and 7.53 and earlier, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) or execute arbitrary code via a long request to TCP port 8886 that begins with a certain negative integer, which passes a signed comparison and triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
