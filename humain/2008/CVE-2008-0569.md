The Comment Upload 4.7.x before 4.7.x-0.1 and 5.x before 5.x-0.1 module for Drupal does not properly use functions in the upload module, which allows remote attackers to bypass upload validation, and upload arbitrary files and possibly execute arbitrary code, via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
