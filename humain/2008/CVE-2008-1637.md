# CVE-2008-1637

- Published: 2008-04-02T17:44:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:35:00

PowerDNS Recursor before 3.1.5 uses insufficient randomness to calculate (1) TRXID values and (2) UDP source port numbers, which makes it easier for remote attackers to poison a DNS cache, related to (a) algorithmic deficiencies in rand and random functions in external libraries, (b) use of a 32-bit seed value, and (c) choice of the time of day as the sole seeding information.
