Microsoft Windows Media Player 6.4, Windows Media Format Runtime 7.1 through 11, and Windows Media Services 4.1 and 9 incorrectly associate ISATAP addresses with the Local Intranet zone, which allows remote servers to capture NTLM credentials, and execute arbitrary code through credential-reflection attacks, by sending an authentication request, aka "ISATAP Vulnerability."

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
