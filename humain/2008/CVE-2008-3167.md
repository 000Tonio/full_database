Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in BoonEx Dolphin 6.1.2, when register_globals is enabled, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the (1) dir[plugins] parameter to (a) HTMLSax3.php and (b) safehtml.php in plugins/safehtml/ and the (2) sIncPath parameter to (c) ray/modules/global/inc/content.inc.php. NOTE: vector 1 might be a problem in SafeHTML instead of Dolphin.
