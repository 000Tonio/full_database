# CVE-2008-1930

- Published: 2008-04-28T20:05:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:38:00

The cookie authentication method in WordPress 2.5 relies on a hash of a concatenated string containing USERNAME and EXPIRY_TIME, which allows remote attackers to forge cookies by registering a username that results in the same concatenated string, as demonstrated by registering usernames beginning with "admin" to obtain administrator privileges, aka a "cryptographic splicing" issue.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-6013.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
