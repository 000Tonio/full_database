# CVE-2008-4810

- Published: 2008-10-31T18:09:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:32:00

The _expand_quoted_text function in libs/Smarty_Compiler.class.php in Smarty 2.6.20 before r2797 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via vectors related to templates and (1) a dollar-sign character, aka "php executed in templates;" and (2) a double quoted literal string, aka a "function injection security hole." NOTE: each vector affects slightly different SVN revisions.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
