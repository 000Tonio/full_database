- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:51:00

The Marvell driver for the Linksys WAP4400N Wi-Fi access point with firmware 1.2.14 on the Marvell 88W8361P-BEM1 chipset, when WEP mode is enabled, does not properly parse malformed 802.11 frames, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (reboot or hang-up) via a malformed association request containing the WEP flag, as demonstrated by a request that is too short, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-1144 and CVE-2008-1197.
