Microsoft Windows Mobile 6.0 on HTC Wiza 200 and HTC MDA 8125 devices does not properly handle the first attempt to establish a Bluetooth connection to a peer with a long name, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device reboot) by configuring a Bluetooth device with a long hci name and (1) connecting directly to the Windows Mobile system or (2) waiting for the Windows Mobile system to scan for nearby devices.

### CVSS Score: **5.4**
