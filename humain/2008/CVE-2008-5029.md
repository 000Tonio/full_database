# CVE-2008-5029

- Published: 2008-11-10T16:15:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:53:00

The __scm_destroy function in net/core/scm.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.27.4, 2.6.26, and earlier makes indirect recursive calls to itself through calls to the fput function, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) via vectors related to sending an SCM_RIGHTS message through a UNIX domain socket and closing file descriptors.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
