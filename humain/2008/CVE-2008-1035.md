# CVE-2008-1035

- Published: 2008-06-03T20:32:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:29:00

Use-after-free vulnerability in Apple iCal 3.0.1 on Mac OS X allows remote CalDAV servers, and user-assisted remote attackers, to trigger memory corruption or possibly execute arbitrary code via an "ATTACH;VALUE=URI:S=osumi" line in a .ics file, which triggers a "resource liberation" bug.  NOTE: CVE-2008-2007 was originally used for this issue, but this is the appropriate identifier.
