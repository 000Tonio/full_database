The XSS Filter in Microsoft Internet Explorer 8.0 Beta 2 disables itself upon encountering a certain X-XSS-Protection HTTP header, which allows remote attackers to bypass the XSS protection mechanism and conduct XSS attacks by injecting this header after a CRLF sequence. NOTE: the vendor has reportedly stated that the XSS Filter intentionally does not attempt to "address every conceivable XSS attack scenario."
