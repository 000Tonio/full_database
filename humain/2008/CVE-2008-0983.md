# CVE-2008-0983

- Published: 2008-02-26T18:44:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T22:04:00

lighttpd 1.4.18, and possibly other versions before 1.5.0, does not properly calculate the size of a file descriptor array, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a large number of connections, which triggers an out-of-bounds access.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
