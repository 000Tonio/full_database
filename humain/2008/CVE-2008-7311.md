# CVE-2008-7311

- Published: 2012-04-05T13:25:00

- Modified: 2012-04-12T04:00:00

The session cookie store implementation in Spree 0.2.0 uses a hardcoded config.action_controller_session hash value (aka secret key), which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging an application that contains this value within the config/environment.rb file.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
