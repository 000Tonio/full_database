# CVE-2008-1687

- Published: 2008-04-09T19:05:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:30:00

The (1) maketemp and (2) mkstemp builtin functions in GNU m4 before 1.4.11 do not quote their output when a file is created, which might allow context-dependent attackers to trigger a macro expansion, leading to unspecified use of an incorrect filename.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
