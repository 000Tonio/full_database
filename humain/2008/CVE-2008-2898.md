Directory traversal vulnerability in includes/header.php in Hedgehog-CMS 1.21 allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the c_temp_path parameter. NOTE: in some environments, this can be leveraged for remote file inclusion by using a UNC share pathname or an ftp, ftps, or ssh2.sftp URL.
