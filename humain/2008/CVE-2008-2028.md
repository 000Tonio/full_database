# CVE-2008-2028

- Published: 2008-04-30T16:17:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:30:00

miniBB 2.2, and possibly earlier, when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to obtain the full path via a direct request to the glang parameter in a registernew action to index.php, which leaks the path in an error message.
