# CVE-2008-5625

- Published: 2008-12-17T17:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:56:00

PHP 5 before 5.2.7 does not enforce the error_log safe_mode restrictions when safe_mode is enabled through a php_admin_flag setting in httpd.conf, which allows context-dependent attackers to write to arbitrary files by placing a "php_value error_log" entry in a .htaccess file.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
