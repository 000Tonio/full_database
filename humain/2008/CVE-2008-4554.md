# CVE-2008-4554

- Published: 2008-10-15T20:07:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:32:00

The do_splice_from function in fs/splice.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.27 does not reject file descriptors that have the O_APPEND flag set, which allows local users to bypass append mode and make arbitrary changes to other locations in the file.
