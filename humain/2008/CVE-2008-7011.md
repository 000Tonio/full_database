# CVE-2008-7011

- Published: 2009-08-19T10:30:00

The Unreal engine, as used in Unreal Tournament 3 1.3, Unreal Tournament 2003 and 2004, Dead Man's Hand, Pariah, WarPath, Postal2, and Shadow Ops, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (server exit) via multiple file downloads from the server, which triggers an assertion failure when the Closing flag in UnChan.cpp is set.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
