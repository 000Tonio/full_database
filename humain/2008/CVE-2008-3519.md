# CVE-2008-3519

- Published: 2008-09-23T15:24:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:31:00

The default configuration of the JBossAs component in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (aka JBossEAP or EAP), possibly 4.2 before CP04 and 4.3 before CP02, when a production environment is enabled, sets the DownloadServerClasses property to true, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (non-EJB classes) via a download request, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-3273.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
