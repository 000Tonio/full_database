# CVE-2008-1883

- Published: 2008-04-18T15:05:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:37:00

The server in Blackboard Academic Suite 7.x stores MD5 password hashes that are provided directly by clients, which makes it easier for remote attackers to access accounts via a modified client that skips the javascript/md5.js hash calculation, and instead sends an arbitrary MD5 string.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
