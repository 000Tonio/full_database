The "Make a backup" functionality in Content Management Made Easy (CMME) 1.12 stores sensitive information under the web root with insufficient access control, which allows remote attackers to discover (1) account names and (2) password hashes via a direct request for (a) backup/cmme_data.zip or (b) backup/cmme_cmme.zip.  NOTE: it was later reported that vector a also affects CMME 1.19.
