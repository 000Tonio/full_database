- Published: 2008-03-27T23:44:00

The connection_state_machine function (connections.c) in lighttpd 1.4.19 and earlier, and 1.5.x before 1.5.0, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (active SSL connection loss) by triggering an SSL error, such as disconnecting before a download has finished, which causes all active SSL connections to be lost.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
