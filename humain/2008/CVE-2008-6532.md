Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the update feature in Drupal 5.x before 5.13 and 6.x before 6.7 allow remote attackers to perform unauthorized actions as the superuser via unspecified vectors, as demonstrated by causing the superuser to "execute old updates" that modify the database.
