Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in BitKinex 2.9.3 allow remote FTP and WebDAV servers to create or overwrite arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in (1) a response to a LIST command from the BitKinex FTP client and (2) a response to a PROPFIND command from the BitKinex WebDAV client.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for code execution by writing to a Startup folder.
