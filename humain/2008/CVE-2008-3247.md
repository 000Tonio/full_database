# CVE-2008-3247

- Published: 2008-07-24T15:41:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:31:00

The LDT implementation in the Linux kernel 2.6.25.x before 2.6.25.11 on x86_64 platforms uses an incorrect size for ldt_desc, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
