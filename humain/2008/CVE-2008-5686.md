IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager (TPM) before 5.1.1.1 IF0006, when its LDAP service is shared with other applications, does not require that an LDAP user be listed in the TPM user records, which allows remote authenticated users to execute SOAP commands that access arbitrary TPM functionality, as demonstrated by running provisioning workflows.

### CVSS Score: **8.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
