The Kerberos credential renewal feature in Sun Solaris 8, 9, and 10, and OpenSolaris build snv_01 through snv_104, allows local users to cause a denial of service (authentication failure) via unspecified vectors related to incorrect cache file permissions, and lack of credential storage by the store_cred function in pam_krb5.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
