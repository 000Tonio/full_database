The Application Firewall in Apple Mac OS X 10.5.2 has an incorrect German translation for the "Set access for specific services and applications" radio button that might cause the user to believe that the button is used to restrict access only to specific services and applications, which might allow attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
