# CVE-2008-3283

- Published: 2008-08-29T18:41:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:31:00

Multiple memory leaks in Red Hat Directory Server 7.1 before SP7, Red Hat Directory Server 8, and Fedora Directory Server 1.1.1 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via vectors involving (1) the authentication / bind phase and (2) anonymous LDAP search requests.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
