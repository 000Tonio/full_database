# CVE-2008-7166

- Published: 2009-09-04T10:30:00

Buffer overflow in the web interface in BitTorrent 6.0.1 (build 7859) and earlier, and uTorrent 1.7.6 (build 7859) and earlier, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and crash) via a crafted Range header.  NOTE: this is probably a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-0071 and CVE-2008-0364.
