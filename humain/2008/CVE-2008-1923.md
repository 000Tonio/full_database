- Published: 2008-04-23T16:05:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:30:00

The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) in Asterisk 1.2 before revision 72630 and 1.4 before revision 65679, when configured to allow unauthenticated calls, sends "early audio" to an unverified source IP address of a NEW message, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic amplification) via a spoofed NEW message.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
