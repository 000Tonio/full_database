# CVE-2008-6996

- Published: 2009-08-19T05:24:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:57:00

Google Chrome BETA (0.2.149.27) does not prompt the user before saving an executable file, which makes it easier for remote attackers or malware to cause a denial of service (disk consumption) or exploit other vulnerabilities via a URL that references an executable file, possibly related to the "ask where to save each file before downloading" setting.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
