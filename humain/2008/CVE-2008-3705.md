Stack-based buffer overflow in the CLogger::WriteFormated function in echoware/Logger.cpp in EchoVNC Linux before 1.1.2 allows remote echoServers to execute arbitrary code via a large (1) group or (2) user list, aka a "very crowded echoServer" attack.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
