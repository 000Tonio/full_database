# CVE-2008-4304

- Published: 2008-12-23T18:30:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:32:00

general/login.php in phpCollab 2.5 rc3 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in unspecified input related to the SSL_CLIENT_CERT environment variable. NOTE: in some environments, SSL_CLIENT_CERT always has a base64-encoded string value, which may impose constraints on injection for typical shells.
