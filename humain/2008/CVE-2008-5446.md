Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Applications Framework component in Oracle E-Business Suite 11.5.10 CU2 and 12.0.6 allows remote authenticated users to affect confidentiality via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the January 2009 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on reliable researcher claims that this issue is related to unrestricted guest access to the "About Us Page" in the Oracle Applications Framework (OAF), which allows attackers to obtain sensitive system and application environment information.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
