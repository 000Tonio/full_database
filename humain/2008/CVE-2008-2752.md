Microsoft Word 2000 9.0.2812 and 2003 11.8106.8172 does not properly handle unordered lists, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted .doc file.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
