Cross-domain vulnerability in the WorkerPool API in Google Gears before 0.5.4.2 allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and the intended access restrictions of the allowCrossOrigin function by hosting an assumed-safe file type containing Google Gear commands on the target domain, then accessing that file from the attacking domain, whose response headers are not checked and cause the worker code to run in the target domain.
