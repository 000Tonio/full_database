Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in functions/display_page.func.php in cpCommerce 1.1.0 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) id_product, (2) id_manufacturer, and (3) id_category parameters to unspecified components.  NOTE: this probably overlaps CVE-2007-2959 and CVE-2007-2890.
