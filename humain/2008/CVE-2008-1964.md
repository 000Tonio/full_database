** DISPUTED **  Stack-based buffer overflow in the demux_nsf_send_headers function in src/demuxers/demux_nsf.c in xine-lib allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact via a long copyright field in an NSF header in an NES Sound file, a different issue than CVE-2008-1878.  NOTE: a third party claims that the copyright field always has a safe length.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
