Stack-based buffer overflow in the EnumPrinters function in the Spooler service (nwspool.dll) in Novell Client 4.91 SP2, SP3, and SP4 for Windows allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted RPC request, aka Novell bug 353138, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-5854.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-6701.
