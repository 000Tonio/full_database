Red Hat PKI Common Framework (rhpki-common) in Red Hat Certificate System (aka Certificate Server or RHCS) 7.1 through 7.3, and Netscape Certificate Management System 6.x, does not recognize Certificate Authority profile constraints on Extensions, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended restrictions and conduct man-in-the-middle attacks by submitting a certificate signing request (CSR) and using the resulting certificate.
