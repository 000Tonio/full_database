Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the management interface on the A-LINK WL54AP3 and WL54AP2 access points before firmware 1.4.2-eng1 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) modify the network configuration via certain parameters to goform/formWanTcpipSetup or (2) modify credentials via certain parameters to goform/formPasswordSetup.
