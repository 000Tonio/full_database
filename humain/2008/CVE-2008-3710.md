# CVE-2008-3710

- Published: 2008-08-19T19:41:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:32:00

Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in CyBoards PHP Lite 1.21 allow remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via directory traversal sequences in the (1) script_path parameter to (a) options.php and the (2) lang_code parameter to (b) copy_vip.php and (c) process_edit_board.php in adminopts/.  NOTE: some of these vectors might not be vulnerabilities under proper installation. In order to exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code, the attacker would first be required to upload a malicious file or inject arbitrary commands into an existing file and register_globals must be enabled.
