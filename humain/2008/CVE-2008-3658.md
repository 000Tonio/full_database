# CVE-2008-3658

- Published: 2008-08-15T00:41:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:49:00

Buffer overflow in the imageloadfont function in ext/gd/gd.c in PHP 4.4.x before 4.4.9 and PHP 5.2 before 5.2.6-r6 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted font file. Mitre Description references "PHP 5.6 through 5.2.6" -- however research to the changelog for PHP 5 does not reflect a 5.6 release  

changelog: http://www.php.net/ChangeLog-5.php


However, http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2008/08/08/2:
"Those issues are fixed by the recent php-4.4.9 release, but they affect 
php-5.2.6 as well and the fixes are not part of any released version in 
case of 5.2."
