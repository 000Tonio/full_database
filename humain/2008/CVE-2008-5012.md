# CVE-2008-5012

- Published: 2008-11-13T11:30:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:19:00

Mozilla Firefox 2.x before 2.0.0.18, Thunderbird 2.x before 2.0.0.18, and SeaMonkey 1.x before 1.1.13 do not properly change the source URI when processing a canvas element and an HTTP redirect, which allows remote attackers to bypass the same origin policy and access arbitrary images that are not directly accessible to the attacker. NOTE: this issue can be leveraged to enumerate software on the client by performing redirections related to moz-icon.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
