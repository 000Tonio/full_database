# CVE-2008-4679

- Published: 2008-10-22T18:00:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:32:00

The Web Services Security component in IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) 6.0.2 before 6.0.2.31 and 6.1 before 6.1.0.19, when Certificate Store Collections is configured to use Certificate Revocation Lists (CRL), does not call the setRevocationEnabled method on the PKIXBuilderParameters object, which prevents the "Java security method" from checking the revocation status of X.509 certificates and allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a SOAP message with a revoked certificate.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
