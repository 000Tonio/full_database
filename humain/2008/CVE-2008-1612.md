# CVE-2008-1612

- Published: 2008-04-01T17:44:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:18:00

The arrayShrink function (lib/Array.c) in Squid 2.6.STABLE17 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (process exit) via unknown vectors that cause an array to shrink to 0 entries, which triggers an assert error. NOTE: this issue is due to an incorrect fix for CVE-2007-6239.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
