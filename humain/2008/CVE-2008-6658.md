Directory traversal vulnerability in index.php in Simple Machines Forum (SMF) 1.0 before 1.0.15 and 1.1 before 1.1.7 allows remote authenticated administrators to install packages from arbitrary directories via a .. (dot dot) in the package parameter during an install2 action, as demonstrated by a predictable package filename in attachments/ that was uploaded through a post2 action to index.php.
