The real_parse_audio_specific_data function in demux_real.c in xine-lib 1.1.12, and other 1.1.15 and earlier versions, uses an untrusted height (aka codec_data_length) value as a divisor, which allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and crash) via a zero value.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
