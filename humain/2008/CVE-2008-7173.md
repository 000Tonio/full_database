The Jura Internet Connection Kit for the Jura Impressa F90 coffee maker does not properly restrict access to privileged functions, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (physical damage), modify coffee settings, and possibly execute code via a crafted request.  NOTE: this issue is being included in CVE because the denial of service may include financial loss or water damage.
