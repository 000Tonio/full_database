# CVE-2008-3659

- Published: 2008-08-15T00:41:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:49:00

Buffer overflow in the memnstr function in PHP 4.4.x before 4.4.9 and PHP 5.6 through 5.2.6 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via the delimiter argument to the explode function.  NOTE: the scope of this issue is limited since most applications would not use an attacker-controlled delimiter, but local attacks against safe_mode are feasible. Overview contains a typo, should read "PHP 5.2 through 5.2.6" not "5.6 through 5.2.6".
