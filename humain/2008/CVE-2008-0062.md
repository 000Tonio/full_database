- Published: 2008-03-19T10:44:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:57:00

KDC in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5kdc) does not set a global variable for some krb4 message types, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted messages that trigger a NULL pointer dereference or double-free.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
