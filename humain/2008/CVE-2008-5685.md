Sun ScApp firmware 5.18.x, 5.19.x, and 5.20.0 through 5.20.10 on Sun Fire and Netra platforms allows remote attackers to access the System Controller (SC), the system console, and possibly the host OS, and cause a denial of service (shutdown or reboot), via spoofed IP packets. Note: This issue only impacts systems that have a System Controller V2 without SSH enabled.
