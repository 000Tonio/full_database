- Published: 2008-02-26T00:44:00

Directory traversal vulnerability in the Shared Folders feature for VMWare ACE 1.0.2 and 2.0.2, Player 1.0.4 and 2.0.2, and Workstation 5.5.4 and 6.0.2 allows guest OS users to read and write arbitrary files on the host OS via a multibyte string that produces a wide character string containing .. (dot dot) sequences, which bypasses the protection mechanism, as demonstrated using a "%c0%2e%c0%2e" string.

### CVSS Score: **6.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
