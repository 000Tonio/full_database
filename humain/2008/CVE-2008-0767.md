# CVE-2008-0767

- Published: 2008-02-13T21:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T22:02:00

ExtremeZ-IP.exe in ExtremeZ-IP File and Print Server 5.1.2x15 and earlier does not verify that a certain "number of URLs" field is consistent with the packet length, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a large integer in this field in a packet to the Service Location Protocol (SLP) service on UDP port 427, triggering an out-of-bounds read.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
