# CVE-2008-5695

- Published: 2008-12-19T18:30:00

- Modified: 2021-04-21T14:43:00

wp-admin/options.php in WordPress MU before 1.3.2, and WordPress 2.3.2 and earlier, does not properly validate requests to update an option, which allows remote authenticated users with manage_options and upload_files capabilities to execute arbitrary code by uploading a PHP script and adding this script's pathname to active_plugins.

### CVSS Score: **8.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
