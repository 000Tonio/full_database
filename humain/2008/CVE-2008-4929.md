MyBB (aka MyBulletinBoard) 1.4.2 uses insufficient randomness to compose filenames of uploaded files used as attachments, which makes it easier for remote attackers to read these files by guessing filenames.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
