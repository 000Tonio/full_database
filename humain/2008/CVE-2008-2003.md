BadBlue 2.72 Personal Edition stores multiple programs in the web document root with insufficient access control, which allows remote attackers to (1) cause a denial of service via multiple invocations of uninst.exe, and have an unknown impact via (2) badblue.exe and (3) dyndns.exe.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for arbitrary remote code execution in conjunction with CVE-2007-6378.
