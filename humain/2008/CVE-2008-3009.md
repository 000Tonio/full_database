# CVE-2008-3009

- Published: 2008-12-10T14:00:00

- Modified: 2019-02-26T14:04:00

Microsoft Windows Media Player 6.4, Windows Media Format Runtime 7.1 through 11, and Windows Media Services 4.1, 9, and 2008 do not properly use the Service Principal Name (SPN) identifier when validating replies to authentication requests, which allows remote servers to execute arbitrary code via vectors that employ NTLM credential reflection, aka "SPN Vulnerability."

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
