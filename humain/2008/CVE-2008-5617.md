The ACL handling in rsyslog 3.12.1 to 3.20.0, 4.1.0, and 4.1.1 does not follow $AllowedSender directive, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and spoof log messages or create a large number of spurious messages.

### CVSS Score: **8.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
