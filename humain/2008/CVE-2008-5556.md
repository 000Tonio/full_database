** DISPUTED **  The XSS Filter in Microsoft Internet Explorer 8.0 Beta 2 does not recognize attack patterns designed to operate against web pages that are encoded with utf-7, which allows remote attackers to bypass the XSS protection mechanism and conduct XSS attacks by injecting crafted utf-7 content.  NOTE: the vendor reportedly disputes this issue, stating "Behaviour is by design."
