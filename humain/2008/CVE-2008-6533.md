Drupal 5.x before 5.13 and 6.x before 6.7 does not delete all related content when an input format is deleted, which prevents the content from being properly filtered and allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
