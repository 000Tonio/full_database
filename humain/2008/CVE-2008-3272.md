- Published: 2008-08-08T18:41:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:19:00

The snd_seq_oss_synth_make_info function in sound/core/seq/oss/seq_oss_synth.c in the sound subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.27-rc2 does not verify that the device number is within the range defined by max_synthdev before returning certain data to the caller, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| --- | --- | --- |
