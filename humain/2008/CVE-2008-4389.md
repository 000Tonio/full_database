- Published: 2010-06-17T16:30:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:32:00

Symantec AppStream 5.2.x and Symantec Workspace Streaming (SWS) 6.1.x before 6.1 SP4 do not properly perform authentication, which allows remote Workspace Streaming servers and man-in-the-middle attackers to download arbitrary executable files onto a client system, and execute these files, via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
