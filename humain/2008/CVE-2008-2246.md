# CVE-2008-2246

- Published: 2008-08-13T00:41:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:25:00

Microsoft Windows Vista through SP1 and Server 2008 do not properly import the default IPsec policy from a Windows Server 2003 domain to a Windows Server 2008 domain, which prevents IPsec rules from being enforced and allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
