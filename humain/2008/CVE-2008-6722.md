Novell Access Manager 3 SP4 does not properly expire X.509 certificate sessions, which allows physically proximate attackers to obtain a logged-in session by using a victim's web-browser process that continues to send the original and valid SSL sessionID, related to inability of Apache Tomcat to clear entries from its SSL cache.
