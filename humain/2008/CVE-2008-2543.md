# CVE-2008-2543

- Published: 2008-06-05T20:32:00

The ooh323 channel driver in Asterisk Addons 1.2.x before 1.2.9 and Asterisk-Addons 1.4.x before 1.4.7 creates a remotely accessible TCP port that is intended solely for localhost communication, and interprets some TCP application-data fields as addresses of memory to free, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via crafted TCP packets.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
