# CVE-2008-7182

- Published: 2009-09-08T10:30:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:33:00

Buffer overflow in the IMAP service in NetWin Surgemail 3.9e, and possibly other versions before 3.9g2, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long first argument to the APPEND command, a different vector than CVE-2008-1497 and CVE-2008-1498.  NOTE: due to lack of details, it is not certain whether this is the same issue as CVE-2008-2859.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
