# CVE-2008-4097

- Published: 2008-09-18T15:04:00

- Modified: 2020-02-18T19:22:00

MySQL 5.0.51a allows local users to bypass certain privilege checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1) DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are associated with symlinks within pathnames for subdirectories of the MySQL home data directory, which are followed when tables are created in the future. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-2079. Per http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/29106 this vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
