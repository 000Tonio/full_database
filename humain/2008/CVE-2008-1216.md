# CVE-2008-1216

- Published: 2008-03-09T02:44:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:30:00

IBM Lotus Quickr 8.0 server, and possibly QuickPlace 7.x, does not properly identify URIs containing cross-site scripting (XSS) attack strings, which allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a Calendar OpenDocument action to main.nsf with a Count parameter containing a JavaScript event in a malformed element, as demonstrated by an onload event in an IFRAME element.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
