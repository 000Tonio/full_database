Integer overflow in the PCRE regular expression compiler (JavaScriptCore/pcre/pcre_compile.cpp) in Apple WebKit, as used in Safari before 3.1.1, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a regular expression with large, nested repetition counts, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
