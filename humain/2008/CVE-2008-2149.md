# CVE-2008-2149

- Published: 2008-05-12T21:20:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:30:00

Stack-based buffer overflow in the searchwn function in Wordnet 2.0, 2.1, and 3.0 might allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long command line option.  NOTE: this issue probably does not cross privilege boundaries except in cases in which Wordnet is used as a back end.
