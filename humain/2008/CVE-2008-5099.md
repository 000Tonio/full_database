Sun Logical Domain Manager (aka LDoms Manager or ldm) 1.0 through 1.0.3 displays the value of the OpenBoot PROM (OBP) security-password variable in cleartext, which allows local users to bypass the SPARC firmware's password protection, and gain privileges or obtain data access, via the "ldm ls -l" command, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-4992. http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-243606-1

Note: The x86 Platform is not affected by this issue, as Logical Domains (LDoms) software is supported only on the Sun SPARC Platform.
