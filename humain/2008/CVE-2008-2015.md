# CVE-2008-2015

- Published: 2008-04-30T01:07:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:30:00

Multiple absolute path traversal vulnerabilities in certain ActiveX controls in WatchFire AppScan 7.0 allow remote attackers to create or overwrite arbitrary files via a full pathname in the argument to the (1) CompactSave and (2) SaveSession method in one control, and the (3) saveRecordedExploreToFile method in a different control.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for code execution by writing to a Startup folder.
