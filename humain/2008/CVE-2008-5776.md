Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in Aperto Blog 0.1.1 allow remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via directory traversal sequences in the (1) action parameter to admin.php and the (2) get parameter to index.php.  NOTE: in some environments, this can be leveraged for remote file inclusion by using a UNC share pathname or an ftp, ftps, or ssh2.sftp URL.
