Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in vtiger CRM 5.0.4 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the parenttab parameter in an index action to the Products module, as reachable through index.php; (2) the user_password parameter in an Authenticate action to the Users module, as reachable through index.php; or (3) the query_string parameter in a UnifiedSearch action to the Home module, as reachable through index.php.
