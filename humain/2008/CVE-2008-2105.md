# CVE-2008-2105

- Published: 2008-05-07T20:20:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:30:00

email_in.pl in Bugzilla 2.23.4, 3.0.x before 3.0.4, and 3.1.x before 3.1.4 allows remote authenticated users to more easily spoof the changer of a bug via a @reporter command in the body of an e-mail message, which overrides the e-mail address as normally obtained from the From e-mail header.  NOTE: since From headers are easily spoofed, this only crosses privilege boundaries in environments that provide additional verification of e-mail addresses.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
