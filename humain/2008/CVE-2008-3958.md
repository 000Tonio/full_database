IBM DB2 UDB 8 before Fixpak 17 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (instance crash) via a crafted CONNECT/ATTACH data stream that simulates a V7 client connect/attach request.  NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2008-3858.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-3959. http://secunia.com/advisories/31787

Some vulnerabilities have been reported in DB2, where some have an unknown impact and others can be exploited by malicious users to perform certain actions with escalated privileges, and by malicious people to cause a DoS or potentially compromise a vulnerable system.
