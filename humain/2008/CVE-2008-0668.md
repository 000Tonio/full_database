# CVE-2008-0668

- Published: 2008-02-11T21:00:00

- Modified: 2011-03-08T03:05:00

The excel_read_HLINK function in plugins/excel/ms-excel-read.c in Gnome Office Gnumeric before 1.8.1 allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted XLS file containing XLS HLINK opcodes, possibly because of an integer signedness error that leads to an integer overflow.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
