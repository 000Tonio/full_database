The DebugDiag ActiveX control in CrashHangExt.dll, possibly 1.0, in Microsoft Debug Diagnostic Tool allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and Internet Explorer 6.0 crash) via a large negative integer argument to the GetEntryPointForThread method.  NOTE: this issue might only be exploitable in limited environments or non-default browser settings.
