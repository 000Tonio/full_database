# CVE-2008-5187

- Published: 2008-11-21T02:30:00

- Modified: 2011-03-08T03:14:00

The load function in the XPM loader for imlib2 1.4.2, and possibly other versions, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted XPM file that triggers a "pointer arithmetic error" and a heap-based buffer overflow, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-2426.
