Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in index.php in Tuned Studios (1) Subwoofer, (2) Freeze Theme, (3) Orange Cutout, (4) Lonely Maple, (5) Endless, (6) Classic Theme, and (7) Music Theme webpage templates allow remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary files via ".." sequences in the page parameter.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for remote file inclusion when running in some PHP 5 environments.
