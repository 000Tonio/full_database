Apple QuickTime before 7.5 uses the url.dll!FileProtocolHandler handler for unrecognized URIs in qt:next attributes within SMIL text in video files, which sends these URIs to explorer.exe and thereby allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary programs, as originally demonstrated by crafted file: URLs.
