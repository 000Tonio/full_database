- Published: 2008-11-01T06:00:00

Directory traversal vulnerability in the web server in Philips Electronics VOIP841 DECT Phone with firmware 1.0.4.50 and 1.0.4.80 allows remote authenticated users to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in a GET request.  NOTE: this can be leveraged with CVE-2008-4874 for unauthenticated access to sensitive files such as (1) save.dat and (2) apply.log, which can contain other credentials such as the Skype username and password.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
