Xiph.org libvorbis before 1.0 does not properly check for underpopulated Huffman trees, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted OGG file that triggers memory corruption during execution of the _make_decode_tree function. Per http://svn.xiph.org/trunk/vorbis/CHANGES, 1.0 is the first stable release of libvorbis.  No version of libvorbis before 1.0 has been confirmed at this time.
