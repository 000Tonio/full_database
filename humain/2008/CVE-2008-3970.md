pam_mount 0.10 through 0.45, when luserconf is enabled, does not verify mountpoint and source ownership before mounting a user-defined volume, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions via a local mount.

### CVSS Score: **6.9**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| --- | --- | --- |
