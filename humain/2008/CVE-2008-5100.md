The strong name (SN) implementation in Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0.50727 relies on the digital signature Public Key Token embedded in the pathname of a DLL file instead of the digital signature of this file itself, which makes it easier for attackers to bypass Global Assembly Cache (GAC) and Code Access Security (CAS) protection mechanisms, aka MSRC ticket MSRC8566gs.

### CVSS Score: **10**
