- Published: 2008-10-15T00:12:00

- Modified: 2018-10-12T21:48:00

Microsoft Host Integration Server (HIS) 2000, 2004, and 2006 does not limit RPC access to administrative functions, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary programs via a crafted SNA RPC message using opcode 1 or 6 to call the CreateProcess function, aka "HIS Command Execution Vulnerability."

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
