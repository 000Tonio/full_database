# CVE-2008-4930

- Published: 2008-11-04T21:00:00

- Modified: 2008-11-05T05:00:00

MyBB (aka MyBulletinBoard) 1.4.2 does not properly handle an uploaded file with a nonstandard file type that contains HTML sequences, which allows remote attackers to cause that file to be processed as HTML by Internet Explorer's content inspection, aka "Incomplete protection against MIME-sniffing." NOTE: this could be leveraged for XSS and other attacks.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
