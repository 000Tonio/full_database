# CVE-2008-2803

- Published: 2008-07-07T23:41:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:43:00

The mozIJSSubScriptLoader.LoadScript function in Mozilla Firefox before 2.0.0.15, Thunderbird 2.0.0.14 and earlier, and SeaMonkey before 1.1.10 does not apply XPCNativeWrappers to scripts loaded from (1) file: URIs, (2) data: URIs, or (3) certain non-canonical chrome: URIs, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving third-party add-ons.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
