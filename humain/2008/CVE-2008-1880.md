The default configuration of Firebird before 2.0.3.12981.0-r6 on Gentoo Linux sets the ISC_PASSWORD environment variable before starting Firebird, which allows remote attackers to bypass SYSDBA authentication and obtain sensitive database information via an empty password.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
