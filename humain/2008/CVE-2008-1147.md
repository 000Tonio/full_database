# CVE-2008-1147

- Published: 2008-03-04T23:44:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:29:00

A certain pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) algorithm that uses XOR and 2-bit random hops (aka "Algorithm X2"), as used in OpenBSD 2.6 through 3.4, Mac OS X 10 through 10.5.1, FreeBSD 4.4 through 7.0, and DragonFlyBSD 1.0 through 1.10.1, allows remote attackers to guess sensitive values such as IP fragmentation IDs by observing a sequence of previously generated values.  NOTE: this issue can be leveraged for attacks such as injection into TCP packets and OS fingerprinting.
