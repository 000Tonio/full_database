The disconnection feature in Citrix Web Interface 5.0 and 5.0.1 for Java Application Servers does not properly terminate a user's web interface session, which allows attackers with access to the same browser instance to gain access to the user's Web Interface session. NOTE: the attacker must also have valid credentials to the Web Interface.
