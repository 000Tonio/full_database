# CVE-2008-6393

- Published: 2009-03-03T16:30:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:33:00

PSI Jabber client before 0.12.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a file transfer request with a negative value in a SOCKS5 option, which bypasses a signed integer check and triggers an integer overflow and a heap-based buffer overflow.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
