The "Java Update" feature for Java Runtime Environment (JRE) for Sun JDK and JRE 6 Update 10 and earlier; JDK and JRE 5.0 Update 16 and earlier; and SDK and JRE 1.4.2_18 and earlier does not verify the signature of the JRE that is downloaded, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via DNS man-in-the-middle attacks.
