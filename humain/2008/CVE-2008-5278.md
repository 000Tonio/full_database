# CVE-2008-5278

- Published: 2008-11-28T19:30:00

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the self_link function in in the RSS Feed Generator (wp-includes/feed.php) for WordPress before 2.6.5 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the Host header (HTTP_HOST variable). http://wordpress.org/development/2008/11/wordpress-265/

The security issue is an XSS exploit discovered by Jeremias Reith that fortunately only affects IP-based virtual servers running on Apache 2.x. If you are interested only in the security fix, copy wp-includes/feed.php and wp-includes/version.php from the 2.6.5 release package.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
