# CVE-2008-0884

- Published: 2008-04-04T00:44:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:18:00

The Replace function in the capp-lspp-config script in the (1) lspp-eal4-config-ibm and (2) capp-lspp-eal4-config-hp packages before 0.65-2 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 uses lstat instead of stat to determine the /etc/pam.d/system-auth file permissions, leading to a change to world-writable permissions for the /etc/pam.d/system-auth-ac file, which allows local users to gain privileges by modifying this file.

### CVSS Score: **6.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
