# CVE-2008-3916

- Published: 2008-09-04T18:41:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:50:00

Heap-based buffer overflow in the strip_escapes function in signal.c in GNU ed before 1.0 allows context-dependent or user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long filename.  NOTE: since ed itself does not typically run with special privileges, this issue only crosses privilege boundaries when ed is invoked as a third-party component. http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/44643

"GNU ed is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the strip_escapes() function. By persuading a victim to open a specially-crafted file, a remote attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system."
