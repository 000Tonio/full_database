Multiple open redirect vulnerabilities in AIST NetCat 3.12 and earlier allow remote attackers to redirect users to arbitrary web sites and conduct phishing attacks via (1) the redirect parameter in a logoff action to modules/auth/index.php or (2) the url parameter to modules/linkmanager/redirect.php.  NOTE: this was reported within an "HTTP Response Splitting" section in the original disclosure.
