Open redirect vulnerability in interface/redirect.htm.php in Mjguest 6.7 GT Rev.01 allows user-assisted remote attackers to redirect users to arbitrary web sites and conduct phishing attacks via a URL in the goto parameter in a redirect action to mjguest.php.  NOTE: this is user-assisted because there is a delay and a notification before redirection occurs.
