# CVE-2008-2516

- Published: 2008-06-03T14:32:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:31:00

pam_sm_authenticate in pam_pgsql.c in libpam-pgsql 0.6.3 does not properly consider operator precedence when evaluating the success of a pam_get_pass function call, which allows local users to gain privileges via a SIGINT signal when this function is executing, as demonstrated by a CTRL-C sequence at a sudo password prompt in an "auth sufficient pam_pgsql.so" configuration.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
