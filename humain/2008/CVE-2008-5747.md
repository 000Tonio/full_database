F-Prot 4.6.8 for GNU/Linux allows remote attackers to bypass anti-virus protection via a crafted ELF program with a "corrupted" header that still allows the program to be executed.  NOTE: due to an error in the initial disclosure, F-secure was incorrectly stated as the vendor.

### CVSS Score: **5**
