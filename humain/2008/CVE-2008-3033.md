# CVE-2008-3033

- Published: 2008-07-07T18:41:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:45:00

RSS-aggregator 1.0 does not require administrative authentication for the admin/fonctions/ directory, which allows remote attackers to access admin functions and have unspecified other impact, as demonstrated by (1) an IdFlux request to supprimer_flux.php and (2) a TpsRafraich request to modifier_tps_rafraich.php.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
