# CVE-2008-6107

- Published: 2009-02-10T22:00:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:33:00

The (1) sys32_mremap function in arch/sparc64/kernel/sys_sparc32.c, the (2) sparc_mmap_check function in arch/sparc/kernel/sys_sparc.c, and the (3) sparc64_mmap_check function in arch/sparc64/kernel/sys_sparc.c, in the Linux kernel before 2.6.25.4, omit some virtual-address range (aka span) checks when the mremap MREMAP_FIXED bit is not set, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) via unspecified mremap calls, a related issue to CVE-2008-2137.
