Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in WS-Proxy in Eye-Fi 1.1.2 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of users for requests that modify configuration via a SOAPAction parameter of (1) urn:SetOptions for autostart, (2) urn:SetDesktopSync for file upload, or (3) urn:SetFolderConfig for file download location or modification of authentication credentials; and (4) urn:AddNetwork for adding an arbitrary Service Set Identifier (SSID) to hijack the image upload.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
