# CVE-2008-5624

- Published: 2008-12-17T17:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:56:00

PHP 5 before 5.2.7 does not properly initialize the page_uid and page_gid global variables for use by the SAPI php_getuid function, which allows context-dependent attackers to bypass safe_mode restrictions via variable settings that are intended to be restricted to root, as demonstrated by a setting of /etc for the error_log variable.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
