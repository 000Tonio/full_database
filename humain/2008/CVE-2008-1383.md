The docert function in ssl-cert.eclass, when used by src_compile or src_install on Gentoo Linux, stores the SSL key in a binpkg, which allows local users to extract the key from the binpkg, and causes multiple systems that use this binpkg to have the same SSL key and certificate.

| --- | --- | --- |
