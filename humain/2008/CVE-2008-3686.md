# CVE-2008-3686

- Published: 2008-08-14T22:41:00

The rt6_fill_node function in net/ipv6/route.c in Linux kernel 2.6.26-rc4, 2.6.26.2, and possibly other 2.6.26 versions, allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel OOPS) via IPv6 requests when no IPv6 input device is in use, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
