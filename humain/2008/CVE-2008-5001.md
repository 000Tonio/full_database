Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in multiple functions in vncviewer/FileTransfer.cpp in vncviewer for UltraVNC 1.0.2 and 1.0.4 before 01252008, when in LISTENING mode or when using the DSM plugin, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified parameters, a different issue than CVE-2008-0610.
