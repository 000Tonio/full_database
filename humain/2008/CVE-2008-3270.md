# CVE-2008-3270

- Published: 2008-08-18T17:41:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:31:00

yum-rhn-plugin in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 does not verify the SSL certificate for a file download from a Red Hat Network (RHN) server, which makes it easier for remote man-in-the-middle attackers to cause a denial of service (loss of updates) or force the download and installation of official Red Hat packages that were not requested.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
