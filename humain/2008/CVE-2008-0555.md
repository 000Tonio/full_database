# CVE-2008-0555

- Published: 2008-04-04T00:44:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T22:01:00

The ExpandCert function in Apache-SSL before apache_1.3.41+ssl_1.59 does not properly handle (1) '/' and (2) '=' characters in a Distinguished Name (DN) in a client certificate, which might allow remote attackers to bypass authentication via a crafted DN that triggers overwriting of environment variables.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
