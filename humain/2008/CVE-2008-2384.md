SQL injection vulnerability in mod_auth_mysql.c in the mod-auth-mysql (aka libapache2-mod-auth-mysql) module for the Apache HTTP Server 2.x, when configured to use a multibyte character set that allows a \ (backslash) as part of the character encoding, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified inputs in a login request. Please note that this describes the software used in debian as mod-auth-mysql (binary name is libapache2-mod-auth-mysql). It is different from the Sourceforge project.
