# CVE-2008-3271

- Published: 2008-10-13T20:00:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:19:00

Apache Tomcat 5.5.0 and 4.1.0 through 4.1.31 allows remote attackers to bypass an IP address restriction and obtain sensitive information via a request that is processed concurrently with another request but in a different thread, leading to an instance-variable overwrite associated with a "synchronization problem" and lack of thread safety, and related to RemoteFilterValve, RemoteAddrValve, and RemoteHostValve.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
