# CVE-2008-4101

- Published: 2008-09-18T17:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:50:00

Vim 3.0 through 7.x before 7.2.010 does not properly escape characters, which allows user-assisted attackers to (1) execute arbitrary shell commands by entering a K keystroke on a line that contains a ";" (semicolon) followed by a command, or execute arbitrary Ex commands by entering an argument after a (2) "Ctrl-]" (control close-square-bracket) or (3) "g]" (g close-square-bracket) keystroke sequence, a different issue than CVE-2008-2712. Must have a valid e-mail address to access the patch on the "google groups" link.
