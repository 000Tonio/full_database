# CVE-2008-5233

- Published: 2008-11-26T01:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:54:00

xine-lib 1.1.12, and other versions before 1.1.15, does not check for failure of malloc in circumstances including (1) the mymng_process_header function in demux_mng.c, (2) the open_mod_file function in demux_mod.c, and (3) frame_buffer allocation in the real_parse_audio_specific_data function in demux_real.c, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted media file.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
