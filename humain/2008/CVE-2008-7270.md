# CVE-2008-7270

- Published: 2010-12-06T22:30:00

- Modified: 2012-04-06T03:07:00

OpenSSL before 0.9.8j, when SSL_OP_NETSCAPE_REUSE_CIPHER_CHANGE_BUG is enabled, does not prevent modification of the ciphersuite in the session cache, which allows remote attackers to force the use of a disabled cipher via vectors involving sniffing network traffic to discover a session identifier, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-4180.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
