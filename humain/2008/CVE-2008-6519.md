Format string vulnerability in Xitami Web Server 2.2a through 2.5c2, and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in a Long Running Web Process (LRWP) request, which triggers incorrect logging code involving the sendfmt function in the SMT kernel.
