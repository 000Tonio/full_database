Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Mozilla Firefox before 2.0.0.12, Thunderbird before 2.0.0.12, and SeaMonkey before 1.1.8 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via certain character encodings, including (1) a backspace character that is treated as whitespace, (2) 0x80 with Shift_JIS encoding, and (3) "zero-length non-ASCII sequences" in certain Asian character sets.
