# CVE-2008-2363

- Published: 2008-06-02T21:30:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:30:00

The PartsBatch class in Pan 0.132 and earlier does not properly manage the data structures for Parts batches, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted .nzb file that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
