# CVE-2008-1396

- Published: 2008-03-20T00:44:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:33:00

Plone CMS 3.x uses invariant data (a client username and a server secret) when calculating an HMAC-SHA1 value for an authentication cookie, which makes it easier for remote attackers to gain permanent access to an account by sniffing the network.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
