Microsoft Office 2000 SP3, XP SP3, and 2003 SP2; Office Converter Pack; and Works 8 do not properly parse the length of a PICT file, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted PICT file, aka the "Malformed PICT Filter Vulnerability," a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-3021.
