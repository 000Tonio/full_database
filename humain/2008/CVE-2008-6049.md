** REJECT **  SQL injection vulnerability in index.php in TinyMCE 2.0.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the menuID parameter.  NOTE: CVE and multiple reliable third parties dispute this issue, since TinyMCE does not contain index.php or any PHP code.  This may be an issue in a product that has integrated TinyMCE.
