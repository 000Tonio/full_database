# CVE-2008-4934

- Published: 2008-11-05T15:00:00

- Modified: 2018-11-02T13:47:00

The hfsplus_block_allocate function in fs/hfsplus/bitmap.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.28-rc1 does not check a certain return value from the read_mapping_page function before calling kmap, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a crafted hfsplus filesystem image.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**
