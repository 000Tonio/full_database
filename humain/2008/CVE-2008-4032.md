# CVE-2008-4032

- Published: 2008-12-10T14:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-12T21:48:00

Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 Gold and SP1 and Microsoft Search Server 2008 do not properly perform authentication and authorization for administrative functions, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (server load), obtain sensitive information, and "create scripts that would run in the context of the site" via requests to administrative URIs, aka "Access Control Vulnerability."

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
