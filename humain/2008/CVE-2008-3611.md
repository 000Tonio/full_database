# CVE-2008-3611

- Published: 2008-09-16T23:00:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:32:00

Login Window in Apple Mac OS X 10.4.11 does not clear the current password when a user makes a password-change attempt that is denied by policy, which allows opportunistic, physically proximate attackers to bypass authentication and change this user's password by later entering an acceptable new password on the same login screen.

### CVSS Score: **6.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
