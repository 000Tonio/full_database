# CVE-2008-0132

Pragma FortressSSH 5.0 Build 4 Revision 293 and earlier handles long input to sshd.exe by creating an error-message window and waiting for the administrator to click in this window before terminating the sshd.exe process, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (connection slot exhaustion) via a flood of SSH connections with long data objects, as demonstrated by (1) a long list of keys and (2) a long username.

### CVSS Score: **5**
