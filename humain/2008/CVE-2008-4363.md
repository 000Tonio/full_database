DLMFENC.sys 1.0.0.28 in DESlock+ 3.2.7 allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code via a certain DLMFENC_IOCTL request to \\.\DLKPFSD_Device that overwrites a pointer, probably related to use of the ProbeForRead function when ProbeForWrite was intended.
