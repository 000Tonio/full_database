The shmem_delete_inode function in mm/shmem.c in the tmpfs implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.26.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a certain sequence of file create, remove, and overwrite operations, as demonstrated by the insserv program, related to allocation of "useless pages" and improper maintenance of the i_blocks count.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
