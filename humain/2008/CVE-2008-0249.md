# CVE-2008-0249

- Published: 2008-01-12T02:46:00

PHP Webquest 2.6 allows remote attackers to retrieve database credentials via a direct request to admin/backup_phpwebquest.php, which leaks the credentials in an error message if a call to /usr/bin/mysqldump fails.  NOTE: this might only be an issue in limited environments.

### CVSS Score: **5**
