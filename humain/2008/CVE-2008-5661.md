The IPv4 Forwarding feature in Sun Solaris 10 and OpenSolaris snv_47 through snv_82, with certain patches installed, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) via unknown vectors that trigger a NULL pointer dereference. Per http://sunsolve.sun.com/search/document.do?assetkey=1-26-241126-1

"Note 3: A system is only affected by this issue if it is configured to use IPv4, has a network route with a gateway of 127.0.0.1,  and the route does not have the blackhole flag set."
