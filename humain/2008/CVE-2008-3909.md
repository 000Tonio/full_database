The administration application in Django 0.91, 0.95, and 0.96 stores unauthenticated HTTP POST requests and processes them after successful authentication occurs, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks and delete or modify data via unspecified requests.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
