The ActionScript 2 virtual machine in Adobe Flash Player 10.x before 10.0.12.36 and 9.x before 9.0.151.0, and Adobe AIR before 1.5, does not validate character elements during retrieval from the dictionary data structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted PDF file.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
