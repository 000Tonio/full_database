The menu system in Drupal 6 before 6.2 has incorrect menu settings, which allows remote attackers to (1) edit the profile pages of arbitrary users, and obtain sensitive information from (2) tracker and (3) blog pages, related to a missing check for the "access content" permission; and (4) allows remote authenticated users, with administration page view access, to edit content types.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
