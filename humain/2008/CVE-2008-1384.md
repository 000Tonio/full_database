Integer overflow in PHP 5.2.5 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly have unspecified other impact via a printf format parameter with a large width specifier, related to the php_sprintf_appendstring function in formatted_print.c and probably other functions for formatted strings (aka *printf functions).
