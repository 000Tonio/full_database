# CVE-2008-2374

- Published: 2008-07-07T23:41:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:31:00

src/sdp.c in bluez-libs 3.30 in BlueZ, and other bluez-libs before 3.34 and bluez-utils before 3.34 versions, does not validate string length fields in SDP packets, which allows remote SDP servers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted length field that triggers excessive memory allocation or a buffer over-read.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
