# CVE-2008-6998

- Published: 2009-08-19T05:24:00

Stack-based buffer overflow in chrome/common/gfx/url_elider.cc in Google Chrome 0.2.149.27 and other versions before 0.2.149.29 might allow user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a link target (href attribute) with a large number of path elements, which triggers the overflow when the status bar is updated after the user hovers over the link.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**
