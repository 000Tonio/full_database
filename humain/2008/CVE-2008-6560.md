Buffer overflow in CMAN - The Cluster Manager before 2.03.09-1 on Fedora 9 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption and memory corruption) via a cluster.conf file with many lines.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue crosses privilege boundaries in realistic uses of the product.
