# CVE-2008-1106

- Published: 2008-06-09T23:32:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:29:00

The management interface in Akamai Client (formerly Red Swoosh) 3322 and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via an HTTP request that contains (1) no Referer header, or (2) a spoofed Referer header that matches an approved domain, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks and force the client to download and execute arbitrary files.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | COMPLETE | NONE |
