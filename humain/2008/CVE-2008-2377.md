# CVE-2008-2377

- Published: 2008-08-08T19:41:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:30:00

Use-after-free vulnerability in the _gnutls_handshake_hash_buffers_clear function in lib/gnutls_handshake.c in libgnutls in GnuTLS 2.3.5 through 2.4.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via TLS transmission of data that is improperly used when the peer calls gnutls_handshake within a normal session, leading to attempted access to a deallocated libgcrypt handle.

### CVSS Score: **7.6**
