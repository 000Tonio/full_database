The MHTML protocol handler in a component of Microsoft Outlook Express 5.5 SP2 and 6 through SP1, and Windows Mail, does not assign the correct Internet Explorer Security Zone to UNC share pathnames, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and read arbitrary files via an mhtml: URI in conjunction with a redirection, aka "URL Parsing Cross-Domain Information Disclosure Vulnerability."
