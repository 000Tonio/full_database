# CVE-2008-1144

- Published: 2008-09-05T16:08:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:29:00

The Marvell driver for the Netgear WN802T Wi-Fi access point with firmware 1.3.16 on the Marvell 88W8361P-BEM1 chipset does not properly parse EAPoL-Key packets, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (device reboot or hang) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a malformed EAPoL-Key packet with a crafted "advertised length."

### CVSS Score: **6.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
