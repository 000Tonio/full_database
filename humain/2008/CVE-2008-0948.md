# CVE-2008-0948

- Published: 2008-03-19T00:44:00

- Modified: 2020-01-21T15:44:00

Buffer overflow in the RPC library (lib/rpc/rpc_dtablesize.c) used by libgssrpc and kadmind in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) 1.2.2, and probably other versions before 1.3, when running on systems whose unistd.h does not define the FD_SETSIZE macro, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by triggering a large number of open file descriptors.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**
