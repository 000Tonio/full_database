- Published: 2008-03-10T17:44:00

The control panel on the Belkin F5D7230-4 router with firmware 9.01.10 maintains authentication state by IP address, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by establishing a session from a source IP address of a previously authenticated user, a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-3802.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
