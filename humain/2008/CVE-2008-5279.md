The Local ZIM Server (zcs.exe) in Zilab Chat and Instant Messaging (ZIM) Server 2.1 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) heap-based buffer overflows involving multiple vectors including a long room name and a long source account, and (2) a stack-based buffer overflow with a long username in an information request.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
