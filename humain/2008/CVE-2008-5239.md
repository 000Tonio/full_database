# CVE-2008-5239

- Published: 2008-11-26T01:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:54:00

xine-lib 1.1.12, and other 1.1.15 and earlier versions, does not properly handle (a) negative and (b) zero values during unspecified read function calls in input_file.c, input_net.c, input_smb.c, and input_http.c, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors such as (1) a file or (2) an HTTP response, which triggers consequences such as out-of-bounds reads and heap-based buffer overflows.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
