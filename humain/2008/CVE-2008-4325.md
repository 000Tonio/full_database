# CVE-2008-4325

- Published: 2008-09-30T16:13:00

- Modified: 2010-08-30T04:00:00

lib/viewvc.py in ViewVC 1.0.5 uses the content-type parameter in the HTTP request for the Content-Type header in the HTTP response, which allows remote attackers to cause content to be misinterpreted by the browser via a content-type parameter that is inconsistent with the requested object.  NOTE: this issue might not be a vulnerability, since it requires attacker access to the repository that is being viewed.
