** DISPUTED **  A certain ActiveX control in iisext.dll in Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) allows remote attackers to set a password via a string argument to the SetPassword method.  NOTE: this issue could not be reproduced by a reliable third party.  In addition, the original researcher is unreliable.  Therefore the original disclosure is probably erroneous.
