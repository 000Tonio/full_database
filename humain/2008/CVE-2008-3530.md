sys/netinet6/icmp6.c in the kernel in FreeBSD 6.3 through 7.1, NetBSD 3.0 through 4.0, and possibly other operating systems does not properly check the proposed new MTU in an ICMPv6 Packet Too Big Message, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) via a crafted Packet Too Big Message.
