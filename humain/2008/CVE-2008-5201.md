Directory traversal vulnerability in index.php in OTManager CMS 24a allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the conteudo parameter.  NOTE: in some environments, this can be leveraged for remote file inclusion by using a UNC share pathname or an ftp, ftps, or ssh2.sftp URL.
