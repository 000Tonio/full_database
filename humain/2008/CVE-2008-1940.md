# CVE-2008-1940

- Published: 2008-04-25T06:05:00

The RBAC functionality in grsecurity before 2.1.11-2.6.24.5 and 2.1.11-2.4.36.2 does not enforce user_transition_deny and user_transition_allow rules for the (1) sys_setfsuid and (2) sys_setfsgid calls, which allows local users to bypass restrictions for those calls.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
