The SuiteLink Service (aka slssvc.exe) in WonderWare SuiteLink before 2.0 Patch 01, as used in WonderWare InTouch 8.0, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and service shutdown) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a large length value in a Registration packet to TCP port 5413, which causes a memory allocation failure.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
