# CVE-2008-5234

- Published: 2008-11-26T01:30:00

Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in xine-lib 1.1.12, and other versions before 1.1.15, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors related to (1) a crafted metadata atom size processed by the parse_moov_atom function in demux_qt.c and (2) frame reading in the id3v23_interp_frame function in id3.c.  NOTE: as of 20081122, it is possible that vector 1 has not been fixed in 1.1.15. http://secunia.com/advisories/31502

1) Multiple integer overflows exist within the processing of ID3 tags in src/demuxers/id3.c. These can be exploited to cause heap-based buffer overflows via overly large ID3 frame header size fields.

2) Multiple boundary errors exist within the "demux_real_send_chunk()" function in src/demuxers/demux_real.c. These can potentially be exploited to cause heap-based buffer overflows via specially crafted Real Media files.

3) A boundary error exists within the "open_video_capture_device()" function in src/input/input_v4l.c. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted V4L stream.

4) A boundary error exists within the "parse_moov_atom()" function in src/demuxers/demux_qt.c. This can be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow via a specially crafted Quicktime file.

Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow execution of arbitrary code.

The vulnerabilities are reported in versions prior to 1.1.15. http://secunia.com/advisories/31502

Solution:
Update to version 1.1.15, which fixes vulnerabilities #1-#3. (as noted above).
