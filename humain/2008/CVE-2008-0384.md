# CVE-2008-0384

- Published: 2008-01-22T20:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:25:00

OpenBSD 4.2 allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel panic) by calling the SIOCGIFRTLABEL IOCTL on an interface that does not have a route label, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference when the return value from the rtlabel_id2name function is not checked.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
