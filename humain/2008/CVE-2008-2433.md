# CVE-2008-2433

- Published: 2008-08-27T20:41:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:41:00

The web management console in Trend Micro OfficeScan 7.0 through 8.0, Worry-Free Business Security 5.0, and Client/Server/Messaging Suite 3.5 and 3.6 creates a random session token based only on the login time, which makes it easier for remote attackers to hijack sessions via brute-force attacks.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for code execution through an unspecified "manipulation of the configuration."
