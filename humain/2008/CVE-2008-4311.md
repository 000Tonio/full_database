# CVE-2008-4311

- Published: 2008-12-10T00:30:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:32:00

The default configuration of system.conf in D-Bus (aka DBus) before 1.2.6 omits the send_type attribute in certain rules, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions by (1) sending messages, related to send_requested_reply; and possibly (2) receiving messages, related to receive_requested_reply.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
