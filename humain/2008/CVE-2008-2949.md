# CVE-2008-2949

- Published: 2008-06-30T22:41:00

- Modified: 2021-07-23T15:04:00

Cross-domain vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 and 7 allows remote attackers to change the location property of a frame via the String data type, and use a frame from a different domain to observe domain-independent events, as demonstrated by observing onkeydown events with caballero-listener.  NOTE: according to Microsoft, this is a duplicate of CVE-2008-2947, possibly a different attack vector.
