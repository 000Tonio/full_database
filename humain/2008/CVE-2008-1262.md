The administration panel on the Airspan WiMax ProST 4.1 antenna with 6.5.38.0 software does not verify authentication credentials, which allows remote attackers to (1) upload malformed firmware or (2) bind the antenna to a different WiMAX base station via unspecified requests to forms under process_adv/.

### CVSS Score: **10**
