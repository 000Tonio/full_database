- Published: 2008-04-15T17:05:00

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Blackboard Academic Suite 7.x and earlier, and possibly some 8.0 versions, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the searchText parameter in a Course action to webapps/blackboard/execute/viewCatalog or (2) the data__announcements___pk1_pk2__subject parameter in an ADD action to bin/common/announcement.pl.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
