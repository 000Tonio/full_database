WeFi 3.2.1.4.1, when diagnostic mode is enabled, stores (1) WEP, (2) WPA, and (3) WPA2 access-point keys in (a) ClientWeFiLog.dat, (b) ClientWeFiLog.bak, and possibly (c) a certain .inf file under %PROGRAMFILES%\WeFi\Users\, and uses cleartext for the ClientWeFiLog files, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading these files.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
