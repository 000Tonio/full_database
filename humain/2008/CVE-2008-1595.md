- Published: 2008-03-31T23:44:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:30:00

The proc filesystem in the kernel in IBM AIX 5.2 and 5.3 does not properly enforce directory permissions when a file executing from a directory has weaker permissions than the directory itself, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
