# CVE-2008-2019

- Published: 2008-04-30T01:07:00

Simple Machines Forum (SMF), probably 1.1.4, relies on "randomly generated static" to hinder brute-force attacks on the WAV file (aka audio) CAPTCHA, which allows remote attackers to pass the CAPTCHA test via an automated attack that considers Hamming distances.  NOTE: this issue reportedly exists because of an insufficient fix for CVE-2007-3308.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
