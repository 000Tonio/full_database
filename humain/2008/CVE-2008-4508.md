# CVE-2008-4508

- Published: 2008-10-09T18:00:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:32:00

Stack-based buffer overflow in the file parsing function in Tonec Internet Download Manager, possibly 5.14 and earlier, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted AppleDouble file containing a long string.  NOTE: this is probably a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-2210.
