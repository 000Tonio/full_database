Mozilla Firefox 3.0.5 on Windows Vista allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via JavaScript code with a long string value for the hash property (aka location.hash). NOTE: it was later reported that earlier versions are also affected, and that the impact is CPU consumption and application hang in unspecified circumstances perhaps involving other platforms.
