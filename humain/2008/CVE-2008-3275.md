# CVE-2008-3275

- Published: 2008-08-12T23:41:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:19:00

The (1) real_lookup and (2) __lookup_hash functions in fs/namei.c in the vfs implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.25.15 do not prevent creation of a child dentry for a deleted (aka S_DEAD) directory, which allows local users to cause a denial of service ("overflow" of the UBIFS orphan area) via a series of attempted file creations within deleted directories.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
