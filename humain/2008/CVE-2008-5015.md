Mozilla Firefox 3.x before 3.0.4 assigns chrome privileges to a file: URI when it is accessed in the same tab from a chrome or privileged about: page, which makes it easier for user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges via malicious code in a file that has already been saved on the local system.
