fetchmail 6.3.8 and earlier, when running in -v -v (aka verbose) mode, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash and persistent mail failure) via a malformed mail message with long headers, which triggers an erroneous dereference when using vsnprintf to format log messages.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
