# CVE-2008-5939

- Published: 2009-01-22T11:30:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:32:00

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in index.php in MODx CMS 0.9.6.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a JavaScript event in the username field, possibly related to snippet.ditto.php.  NOTE: some sources list the id parameter as being affected, but this is probably incorrect based on the original disclosure.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
