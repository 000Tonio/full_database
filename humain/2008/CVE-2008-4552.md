# CVE-2008-4552

- Published: 2008-10-14T20:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:52:00

The good_client function in nfs-utils 1.0.9, and possibly other versions before 1.1.3, invokes the hosts_ctl function with the wrong order of arguments, which causes TCP Wrappers to ignore netgroups and allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.
