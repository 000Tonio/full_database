# CVE-2008-1484

- Published: 2008-03-24T23:44:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:35:00

The password reset feature in PunBB 1.2.16 and earlier uses predictable random numbers based on the system time, which allows remote authenticated users to determine the new password via a brute force attack on a seed that is based on the approximate creation time of the targeted account.  NOTE: this issue might be related to CVE-2006-5737.
