Aruba Mobility Controller running ArubaOS 3.3.1.16, and possibly other versions, installs the same default X.509 certificate for all installations, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication. NOTE: this is only a vulnerability when the administrator does not follow recommendations in the product's security documentation.
