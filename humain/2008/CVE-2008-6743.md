RSMScript 1.21 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and gain administrative privileges by setting the verified cookie to an arbitrary value and performing a direct request to (1) delete.php, (2) edit-submit.php, (3) edit.php, (4) submit.php, and (5) update.php, which bypasses the security check that is performed by verify.php.
