# CVE-2008-7068

- Published: 2009-08-25T10:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:26:00

The dba_replace function in PHP 5.2.6 and 4.x allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (file truncation) via a key with the NULL byte.  NOTE: this might only be a vulnerability in limited circumstances in which the attacker can modify or add database entries but does not have permissions to truncate the file.
