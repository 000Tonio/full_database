sockethandler.cpp in HTTP Antivirus Proxy (HAVP) 0.88 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (hang) by connecting to a non-responsive server, which triggers an infinite loop due to an uninitialized variable. https://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_name=487CDF51.5060201%40endian.com


"Afterwards it retries in a loop. This retry loop is infinite, due to a 
not initialised variable.
This happens also only if you use a parent proxy and if the parent proxy 
is a numerical ip address, which don't need to be resolved."
