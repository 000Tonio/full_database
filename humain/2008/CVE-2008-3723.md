Directory traversal vulnerability in index.php in PHPizabi 0.848b C1 HFP3 allows remote authenticated administrators to read arbitrary files via (1) a .. (dot dot), (2) a URL, or possibly (3) a full pathname in the id parameter in an admin.templates.edittemplate action.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information. Attacker must have administrative access

In order to exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code, the attacker would first be required to upload a malicious file or inject arbitrary commands into an existing file.
