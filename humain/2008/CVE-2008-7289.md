IBM Tivoli Directory Server (TDS) 5.2 before 5.2.0.5-TIV-ITDS-LA0007 does not properly handle the simultaneous changing of multiple passwords, which makes it easier for remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (DB2 daemon deadlock) by making password changes that trigger updates to a DB2 password-history table.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
