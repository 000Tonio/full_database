Calacode @Mail 5.41 on Linux does not require administrative authentication for build-plesk-upgrade.php, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by creating and downloading a backup archive of the entire @Mail directory tree.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for remote exploitation of CVE-2008-3395.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information.
