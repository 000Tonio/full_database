Array index error in arch/mips/kernel/scall64-o32.S in the Linux kernel before 2.6.28-rc8 on 64-bit MIPS platforms allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) via an o32 syscall with a small syscall number, which leads to an attempted read operation outside the bounds of the syscall table.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
