# CVE-2008-0591

- Published: 2008-02-09T00:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T22:01:00

Mozilla Firefox before 2.0.0.12 and Thunderbird before 2.0.0.12 does not properly manage a delay timer used in confirmation dialogs, which might allow remote attackers to trick users into confirming an unsafe action, such as remote file execution, by using a timer to change the window focus, aka the "dialog refocus bug" or "ffclick2".

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
