- Published: 2008-03-24T22:44:00

- Modified: 2018-10-12T21:45:00

Microsoft Windows Vista does not properly enforce the NoDriveTypeAutoRun registry value, which allows user-assisted remote attackers, and possibly physically proximate attackers, to execute arbitrary code by inserting a (1) CD-ROM device or (2) U3-enabled USB device containing a filesystem with an Autorun.inf file, and possibly other vectors related to (a) AutoRun and (b) AutoPlay actions.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
