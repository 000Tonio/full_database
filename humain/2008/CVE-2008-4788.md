Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 omits high-bit URL-encoded characters when displaying the address bar, which allows remote attackers to spoof the address bar via a URL with a domain name that differs from an important domain name only in these characters, as demonstrated by using exam%A9ple.com to spoof example.com, aka MSRC ticket MSRC7900.
