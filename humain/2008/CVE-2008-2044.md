# CVE-2008-2044

- Published: 2008-05-01T19:05:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:38:00

includes/library.php in netOffice Dwins 1.3 p2 compares the demoSession variable to the 'true' string literal instead of the true boolean literal, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and execute arbitrary code by setting this variable to 1, as demonstrated by uploading a PHP script via an add action to projects_site/uploadfile.php.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
