Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in ClickAndEmail allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via (1) the ID parameter to admin_dblayers.asp in an update action, (2) the adminid parameter to admin_loginCheck.asp (aka the USERNAME field in admin_main.asp), and (3) the PassWord parameter to admin_loginCheck.asp (aka the PASSWORD field in admin_main.asp).  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
