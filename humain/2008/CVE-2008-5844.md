# CVE-2008-5844

- Published: 2009-01-05T20:30:00

- Modified: 2009-05-14T05:32:00

PHP 5.2.7 contains an incorrect change to the FILTER_UNSAFE_RAW functionality, and unintentionally disables magic_quotes_gpc regardless of the actual magic_quotes_gpc setting, which might make it easier for context-dependent attackers to conduct SQL injection attacks and unspecified other attacks.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
