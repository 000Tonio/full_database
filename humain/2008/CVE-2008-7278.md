# CVE-2008-7278

- Published: 2011-03-18T16:55:00

- Modified: 2011-03-22T04:00:00

The S/MIME feature in Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) before 2.2.5, and 2.3.x before 2.3.0-beta1, does not properly configure the RANDFILE environment variable for OpenSSL, which might make it easier for remote attackers to decrypt e-mail messages that had lower than intended entropy available for cryptographic operations, related to inability to write to the seeding file.

### CVSS Score: **5**
