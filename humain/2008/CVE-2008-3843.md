# CVE-2008-3843

- Published: 2008-08-27T20:41:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:25:00

Request Validation (aka the ValidateRequest filters) in ASP.NET in Microsoft .NET Framework with the MS07-040 update does not properly detect dangerous client input, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, as demonstrated by a query string containing a "<~/" (less-than tilde slash) sequence followed by a crafted STYLE element.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
