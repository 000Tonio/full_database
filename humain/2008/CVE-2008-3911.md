# CVE-2008-3911

- Published: 2008-09-04T17:41:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:32:00

The proc_do_xprt function in net/sunrpc/sysctl.c in the Linux kernel 2.6.26.3 does not check the length of a certain buffer obtained from userspace, which allows local users to overflow a stack-based buffer and have unspecified other impact via a crafted read system call for the /proc/sys/sunrpc/transports file.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
