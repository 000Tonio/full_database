- Published: 2008-12-09T00:30:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:33:00

Tor before 0.2.0.32 does not properly process the ClientDNSRejectInternalAddresses configuration option in situations where an exit relay issues a policy-based refusal of a stream, which allows remote exit relays to have an unknown impact by mapping an internal IP address to the destination hostname of a refused stream.
