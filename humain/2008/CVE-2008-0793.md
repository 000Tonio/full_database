# CVE-2008-0793

- Published: 2008-02-15T02:00:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:29:00

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in search.asp in Tendenci CMS allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) category, (2) searchtext, (3) jobcategoryid, (4) contactcompany, and unspecified other parameters.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this affects Tendenci Enterprise Edition in addition to the product's deployment on Tendenci's own server farm. If only the latter was affected, then this issue should not be included in CVE.
