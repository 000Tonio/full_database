The Axesstel AXW-D800 modem with D2_ETH_109_01_VEBR Jun-14-2006 software does not require authentication for (1) etc/config/System.html, (2) etc/config/Network.html, (3) etc/config/Security.html, (4) cgi-bin/sysconf.cgi, and (5) cgi-bin/route.cgi, which allows remote attackers to change the modem's configuration via direct requests.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
