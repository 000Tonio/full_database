Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in xine-lib before 1.1.15 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors that send ID3 data to the (1) id3v22_interp_frame and (2) id3v24_interp_frame functions in src/demuxers/id3.c.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information.
