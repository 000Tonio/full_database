# CVE-2008-0177

- Published: 2008-02-07T22:00:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:30:00

The ipcomp6_input function in sys/netinet6/ipcomp_input.c in the KAME project before 20071201 does not properly check the return value of the m_pulldown function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) via an IPv6 packet with an IPComp header.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
