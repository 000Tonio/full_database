The installation of Sophos PureMessage for Microsoft Exchange 3.0 before 3.0.2, when both anti-virus and anti-spam are supported, does not create or launch the associated scan engines when the system is under heavy load, which has unspecified impact, probably remote bypass of scanner protection or a denial of service (message loss or delay).
