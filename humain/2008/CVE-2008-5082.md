The verifyProof function in the Token Processing System (TPS) component in Red Hat Certificate System (RHCS) 7.1 through 7.3 and Dogtag Certificate System 1.0 returns successfully even when token enrollment did not use the hardware key, which allows remote authenticated users with enrollment privileges to bypass intended authentication policies by performing enrollment with a software key.
