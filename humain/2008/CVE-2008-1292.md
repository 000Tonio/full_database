ViewVC before 1.0.5 provides revision metadata without properly checking whether access was intended, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading (1) forbidden pathnames in the revision view, (2) log history that can only be reached by traversing a forbidden object, or (3) forbidden diff view path parameters.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
