The ListView control in the Client GUI (AClient.exe) in Symantec Altiris Deployment Solution 6.x before 6.9.355 SP1 allows local users to gain SYSTEM privileges and execute arbitrary commands via a "Shatter" style attack on the "command prompt" hidden GUI button to (1) overwrite the CommandLine parameter to cmd.exe to use SYSTEM privileges and (2) modify the DLL that is loaded using the LoadLibrary API function.
