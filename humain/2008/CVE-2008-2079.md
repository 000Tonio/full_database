MySQL 4.1.x before 4.1.24, 5.0.x before 5.0.60, 5.1.x before 5.1.24, and 6.0.x before 6.0.5 allows local users to bypass certain privilege checks by calling CREATE TABLE on a MyISAM table with modified (1) DATA DIRECTORY or (2) INDEX DIRECTORY arguments that are within the MySQL home data directory, which can point to tables that are created in the future. Per http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/29106 and http://secunia.com/advisories/32222, this vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
