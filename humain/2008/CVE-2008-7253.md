The default configuration of the web server in IBM Lotus Domino Server, possibly 6.0 through 8.0, enables the HTTP TRACE method, which makes it easier for remote attackers to steal cookies and authentication credentials via a cross-site tracing (XST) attack, a related issue to CVE-2004-2763 and CVE-2005-3398.
