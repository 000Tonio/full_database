# CVE-2008-3294

- Published: 2008-07-24T18:41:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:47:00

src/configure.in in Vim 5.0 through 7.1, when used for a build with Python support, does not ensure that the Makefile-conf temporary file has the intended ownership and permissions, which allows local users to execute arbitrary code by modifying this file during a time window, or by creating it ahead of time with permissions that prevent its modification by configure.

### CVSS Score: **3.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
