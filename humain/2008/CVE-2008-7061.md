# CVE-2008-7061

- Published: 2009-08-24T19:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:58:00

The tooltip manager (chrome/views/tooltip_manager.cc) in Google Chrome 0.2.149.29 Build 1798 and possibly other versions before 0.2.149.30 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption or crash) via a tag with a long title attribute, which is not properly handled when displaying a tooltip, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-6994.  NOTE: there is inconsistent information about the environments under which this issue exists.
