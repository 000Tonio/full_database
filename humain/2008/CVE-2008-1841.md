SQL injection vulnerability in the session handling functionality in bridge/coppermine.inc.php in Coppermine Photo Gallery (CPG) 1.4.17 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via an input field associated with the session_id variable, as exploited in the wild in April 2008.  NOTE: the fix for CVE-2008-1840 was intended to address this vulnerability, but is actually inapplicable.
