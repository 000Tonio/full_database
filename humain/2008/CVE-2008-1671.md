start_kdeinit in KDE 3.5.5 through 3.5.9, when installed setuid root, allows local users to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via "user-influenceable input" (probably command-line arguments) that cause start_kdeinit to send SIGUSR1 signals to other processes.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
