# CVE-2008-4576

- Published: 2008-10-15T20:07:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:32:00

sctp in Linux kernel before 2.6.25.18 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (OOPS) via an INIT-ACK that states the peer does not support AUTH, which causes the sctp_process_init function to clean up active transports and triggers the OOPS when the T1-Init timer expires.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
