** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in cforms-css.php in Oliver Seidel cforms (contactforms), a Wordpress plugin, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the tm parameter. NOTE: CVE disputes this issue for 7.3, since there is no tm parameter, and the code exits with a fatal error due to a call to an undefined function.
