# CVE-2008-2933

- Published: 2008-07-17T13:41:00

- Modified: 2018-10-11T20:45:00

Mozilla Firefox before 2.0.0.16, and 3.x before 3.0.1, interprets '|' (pipe) characters in a command-line URI as requests to open multiple tabs, which allows remote attackers to access chrome:i URIs, or read arbitrary local files via manipulations involving a series of URIs that is not entirely handled by a vector application, as exploited in conjunction with CVE-2008-2540.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an insufficient fix for CVE-2005-2267. This attack only works if the user is using another internet-connected application with Firefox not running. Using Firefox, or making sure it is at least running, prevents this attack.
