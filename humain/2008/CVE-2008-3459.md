Unspecified vulnerability in OpenVPN 2.1-beta14 through 2.1-rc8, when running on non-Windows systems, allows remote servers to execute arbitrary commands via crafted (1) lladdr and (2) iproute configuration directives, probably related to shell metacharacters. The following events must take place for successful exploitation:
1) the client has agreed to allow the server to push configuration directives to it by including "pull" or the macro "client" in its configuration file
2) the client succesfully authenticates the server 
3) the server is malicious or has been compromised and is under the control of the attacker
4) the client is running a non-Windows OS.
