# CVE-2008-1368

- Published: 2008-03-18T00:44:00

- Modified: 2021-07-23T12:16:00

CRLF injection vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 and 6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary FTP commands via an ftp:// URL that contains a URL-encoded CRLF (%0D%0A) before the FTP command, which causes the commands to be inserted into an authenticated FTP connection established earlier in the same browser session, as demonstrated using a DELE command, a variant or possibly a regression of CVE-2004-1166.  NOTE: a trailing "//" can force Internet Explorer to try to reuse an existing authenticated connection.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
