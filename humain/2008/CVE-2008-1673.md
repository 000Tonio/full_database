# CVE-2008-1673

- Published: 2008-06-10T00:32:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:18:00

The asn1 implementation in (a) the Linux kernel 2.4 before 2.4.36.6 and 2.6 before 2.6.25.5, as used in the cifs and ip_nat_snmp_basic modules; and (b) the gxsnmp package; does not properly validate length values during decoding of ASN.1 BER data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via (1) a length greater than the working buffer, which can lead to an unspecified overflow; (2) an oid length of zero, which can lead to an off-by-one error; or (3) an indefinite length for a primitive encoding.
