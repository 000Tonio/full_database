# CVE-2008-3219

- Published: 2008-07-18T16:41:00

- Modified: 2021-04-15T13:49:00

The Drupal filter_xss_admin function in 5.x before 5.8 and 6.x before 6.3 does not "prevent use of the object HTML tag in administrator input," which has unknown impact and attack vectors, probably related to an insufficient cross-site scripting (XSS) protection mechanism.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
