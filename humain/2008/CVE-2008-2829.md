# CVE-2008-2829

- Modified: 2019-10-09T22:55:00

php_imap.c in PHP 5.2.5, 5.2.6, 4.x, and other versions, uses obsolete API calls that allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long IMAP request, which triggers an "rfc822.c legacy routine buffer overflow" error message, related to the rfc822_write_address function.

### CVSS Score: **5**
