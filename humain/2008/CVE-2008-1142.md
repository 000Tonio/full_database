# CVE-2008-1142

- Published: 2008-04-07T17:44:00

rxvt 2.6.4 opens a terminal window on :0 if the DISPLAY environment variable is not set, which might allow local users to hijack X11 connections.  NOTE: it was later reported that rxvt-unicode, mrxvt, aterm, multi-aterm, and wterm are also affected.  NOTE: realistic attack scenarios require that the victim enters a command on the wrong machine.
