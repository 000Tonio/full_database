** DISPUTED **  Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Simple Machines Forum (SMF) 1.1.4 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the (1) settings[default_theme_dir] parameter to Sources/Subs-Graphics.php and (2) settings[default_theme_dir] parameter to Sources/Themes.php.  NOTE: CVE and multiple third parties dispute this issue because the files contain a protection mechanism against direct request.
