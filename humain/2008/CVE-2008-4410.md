- Published: 2008-10-03T17:41:00

The vmi_write_ldt_entry function in arch/x86/kernel/vmi_32.c in the Virtual Machine Interface (VMI) in the Linux kernel 2.6.26.5 invokes write_idt_entry where write_ldt_entry was intended, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (persistent application failure) via crafted function calls, related to the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) experiencing improper LDT selector state, a different vulnerability than CVE-2008-3247.
