Multiple buffer overflows in oninit.exe in IBM Informix Dynamic Server (IDS) 7.x through 11.x allow (1) remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long password and (2) remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code via a long DBPATH value. All IBM links require software support sign in to view.
