- Published: 2009-01-28T15:30:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:33:00

The GDTdiIcpt.sys driver in G DATA AntiVirus 2008, InternetSecurity 2008, and TotalCare 2008 populates kernel registers with IOCTL 0x8317001c input values, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or gain privileges via a crafted IOCTL request, as demonstrated by execution of the KeSetEvent function with modified register contents. Per http://trapkit.de/advisories/TKADV2008-008.txt  

Upgrade to G DATA AntiVirus/InternetSecurity/TotalCare 2009.
