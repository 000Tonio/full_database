Microsoft Office Word 2000 SP3 and 2002 SP3 and Office 2004 for Mac allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a Word document with a crafted lcbPlcfBkfSdt field in the File Information Block (FIB), which bypasses an initialization step and triggers an "arbitrary free," aka "Word Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
