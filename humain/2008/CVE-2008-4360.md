# CVE-2008-4360

- Published: 2008-10-03T17:41:00

- Modified: 2018-11-29T15:46:00

mod_userdir in lighttpd before 1.4.20, when a case-insensitive operating system or filesystem is used, performs case-sensitive comparisons on filename components in configuration options, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions, as demonstrated by a request for a .PHP file when there is a configuration rule for .php files.
