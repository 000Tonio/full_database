- Published: 2008-05-02T16:05:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:25:00

Linux kernel 2.6.17, and other versions before 2.6.22, does not check when a user attempts to set RLIMIT_CPU to 0 until after the change is made, which allows local users to bypass intended resource limits.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
