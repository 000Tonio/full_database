# CVE-2008-6065

Oracle Database Server 10.1, 10.2, and 11g grants directory WRITE permissions for arbitrary pathnames that are aliased in a CREATE OR REPLACE DIRECTORY statement, which allows remote authenticated users with CREATE ANY DIRECTORY privileges to gain SYSDBA privileges by aliasing the pathname of the password directory, and then overwriting the password file through UTL_FILE operations, a related issue to CVE-2006-7141.
