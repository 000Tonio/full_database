# CVE-2008-3971

- Published: 2008-09-11T01:13:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:32:00

Heap-based buffer overflow in the open_man_file function in callbacks.c in gmanedit 0.4.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted man page, which is not properly handled during utf8 conversion.  NOTE: another overflow was reported using a configuration file, but that vector does not have a scenario that crosses privilege boundaries.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
