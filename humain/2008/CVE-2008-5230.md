# CVE-2008-5230

- Published: 2008-11-25T23:30:00

- Modified: 2008-12-03T05:00:00

The Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) implementation in unspecified Cisco products and other vendors' products, as used in WPA and WPA2 on Wi-Fi networks, has insufficient countermeasures against certain crafted and replayed packets, which makes it easier for remote attackers to decrypt packets from an access point (AP) to a client and spoof packets from an AP to a client, and conduct ARP poisoning attacks or other attacks, as demonstrated by tkiptun-ng. The impact of this vulnerability has yet to be determined. The full list of affected platforms is subject to change. The NVD will continue to monitor this vulnerability and adjust the configurations as needed.
