Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in vBulletin 3.6.10 and 3.7.1 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unknown vectors and an "obscure method." NOTE: the vector is probably in the redirect parameter to the Admin Control Panel (admincp/index.php).

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
