# CVE-2008-3077

- Published: 2008-07-09T00:41:00

- Modified: 2020-07-31T21:23:00

arch/x86/kernel/ptrace.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.25.10 on the x86_64 platform leaks task_struct references into the sys32_ptrace function, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors, possibly a use-after-free vulnerability.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
