** DISPUTED **  Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in the 123 Flash Chat Module for phpBB allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the phpbb_root_path parameter to (1) 123flashchat.php and (2) phpbb_login_chat.php.  NOTE: CVE disputes this issue because $phpbb_root_path is explicitly set to "./" in both programs.
