Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Flex 3 History Management feature in Adobe Flex 3.0.1 SDK and Flex Builder 3, and generated applications, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the anchor identifier to (1) client-side-detection-with-history/history/historyFrame.html, (2) express-installation-with-history/history/historyFrame.html, or (3) no-player-detection-with-history/history/historyFrame.html in templates/html-templates/.  NOTE: Firefox 2.0 and possibly other browsers prevent exploitation.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
