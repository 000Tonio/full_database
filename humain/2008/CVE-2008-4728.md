- Published: 2008-10-24T00:00:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:32:00

Multiple insecure method vulnerabilities in the DeployRun.DeploymentSetup.1 (DeployRun.dll) ActiveX control 10.0.0.44 in Hummingbird Deployment Wizard 2008 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary programs via the (1) Run and (2) PerformUpdateAsync methods, and (3) modify arbitrary registry values via the SetRegistryValueAsString method.  NOTE: the SetRegistryValueAsString method could be leveraged for code execution by specifying executable file values to Startup folders.
