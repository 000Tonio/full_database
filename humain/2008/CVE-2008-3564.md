Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in index.php in Dayfox Blog 4 allow remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the (1) p, (2) cat, and (3) archive parameters.  NOTE: in some environments, this can be leveraged for remote file inclusion by using a UNC share pathname or an ftp, ftps, or ssh2.sftp URL.
