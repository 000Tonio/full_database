The NeffyLauncher 1.0.5 ActiveX control (NeffyLauncher.dll) in CDNetworks Nefficient Download uses weak cryptography for a KeyCode that blocks unauthorized use of the control, which allows remote attackers to bypass this protection mechanism by calculating the required KeyCode.  NOTE: this can be used by arbitrary web sites to host exploit code that targets this control.
