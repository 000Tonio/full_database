The Filtering Service in Websense Enterprise 5.2 through 6.3 does not consider the IP address during URL categorization, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass filtering via an HTTP request, as demonstrated by a request to a compromised server associated with a specific IP address.

### CVSS Score: **5**
