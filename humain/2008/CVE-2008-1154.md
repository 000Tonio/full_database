- Published: 2008-04-04T19:44:00

The Disaster Recovery Framework (DRF) master server in Cisco Unified Communications products, including Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) 5.x and 6.x, Unified Presence 1.x and 6.x, Emergency Responder 2.x, and Mobility Manager 2.x, does not require authentication for requests received from the network, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
