The Simple Access module for Drupal 5.x through 5.x-1.2-2 does not properly handle the privacy information for nodes, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions, and read or modify nodes, in opportunistic circumstances related to interaction between Simple Access and (1) Node clone or (2) Project issue tracking.
