# CVE-2008-3851

- Published: 2008-08-27T23:41:00

Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in Pluck CMS 4.5.2 on Windows allow remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a ..\ (dot dot backslash) in the (1) blogpost, (2) cat, and (3) file parameters to data/inc/themes/predefined_variables.php, as reachable through index.php; and the (4) blogpost and (5) cat parameters to data/inc/blog_include_react.php, as reachable through index.php.  NOTE: the issue involving vectors 1 through 3 reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2008-3194.
