# CVE-2008-0466

- Published: 2008-01-29T00:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T22:00:00

Web Wiz RTE_file_browser.asp in, as used in Web Wiz Rich Text Editor 4.0, Web Wiz Forums 9.07, and Web Wiz Newspad 1.02, does not require authentication, which allows remote attackers to list directories and read files.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for listings outside the configured directory tree by exploiting a separate directory traversal vulnerability.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
