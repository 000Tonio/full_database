The web interface to the Belkin Wireless G router and ADSL2 modem F5D7632-4V6 with firmware 6.01.08 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and gain administrator privileges via a direct request to (1) statusprocess.exe, (2) system_all.exe, or (3) restore.exe in cgi-bin/.  NOTE: the setup_dns.exe vector is already covered by CVE-2008-1244.
