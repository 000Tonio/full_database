Microsoft Internet Explorer allows web sites to set cookies for domains that have a public suffix with more than one dot character, which could allow remote attackers to perform a session fixation attack and hijack a user's HTTP session, aka "Cross-Site Cooking." NOTE: this issue may exist because of an insufficient fix for CVE-2004-0866.
