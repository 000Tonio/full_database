# CVE-2008-4864

- Published: 2008-11-01T00:00:00

- Modified: 2022-07-05T18:48:00

Multiple integer overflows in imageop.c in the imageop module in Python 1.5.2 through 2.5.1 allow context-dependent attackers to break out of the Python VM and execute arbitrary code via large integer values in certain arguments to the crop function, leading to a buffer overflow, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-4965 and CVE-2008-1679.
