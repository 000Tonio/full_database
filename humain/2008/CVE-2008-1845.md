# CVE-2008-1845

- Published: 2008-04-16T17:05:00

- Modified: 2017-08-08T01:30:00

The Korn shell (aka mksh) before R33d on MirOS (aka MirBSD) does not flush the tty's I/O when invoking mksh in a new terminal, which allows local users to gain privileges by opening a virtual terminal and entering command sequences, which might later be executed in opportunistic circumstances by a different user who launches mksh and specifies that terminal with the -T option.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**
