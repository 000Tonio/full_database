VTE, as used by default in gnome-terminal terminal emulator 2.2 and as an option in gnome-terminal 2.0, allows attackers to modify the window title via a certain character escape sequence and then insert it back to the command line in the user's terminal, e.g. when the user views a file containing the malicious sequence, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands. Per: http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html

'CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')'
