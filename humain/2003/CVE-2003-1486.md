Phorum 3.4 through 3.4.2 allows remote attackers to obtain the full path of the web server via an incorrect HTTP request to (1) smileys.php, (2) quick_listrss.php, (3) purge.php, (4) news.php, (5) memberlist.php, (6) forum_listrss.php, (7) forum_list_rdf.php, (8) forum_list.php, or (9) move.php, which leaks the information in an error message.
