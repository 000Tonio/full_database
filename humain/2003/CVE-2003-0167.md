Multiple off-by-one buffer overflows in the IMAP capability for Mutt 1.3.28 and earlier, and Balsa 1.2.4 and earlier, allow a remote malicious IMAP server to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted mail folder, a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-0140.
