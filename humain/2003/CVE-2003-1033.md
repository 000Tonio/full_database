The (1) instdbmsrv and (2) instlserver programs in SAP DB Development Tools 7.x trust the user-provided INSTROOT environment variable as a path when assigning setuid permissions to the lserver program, which allows local users to gain root privileges via a modified INSTROOT that points to a malicious dbmsrv or lserver program.
