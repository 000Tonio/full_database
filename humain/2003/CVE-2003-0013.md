The default .htaccess scripts for Bugzilla 2.14.x before 2.14.5, 2.16.x before 2.16.2, and 2.17.x before 2.17.3 do not include filenames for backup copies of the localconfig file that are made from editors such as vi and Emacs, which could allow remote attackers to obtain a database password by directly accessing the backup file.
