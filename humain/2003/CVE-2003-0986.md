Various routines for the ppc64 architecture on Linux kernel 2.6 prior to 2.6.2 and 2.4 prior to 2.4.24 do not use the copy_from_user function when copying data from userspace to kernelspace, which crosses security boundaries and allows local users to cause a denial of service.

### CVSS Score: **1.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
