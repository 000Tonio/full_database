SCO UnixWare 7.1.1, 7.1.3, and Open UNIX 8.0.0 allows local users to bypass protections for the "as" address space file for a process ID (PID) by obtaining a procfs file descriptor for the file and calling execve() on a setuid or setgid program, which leaves the descriptor open to the user.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| --- | --- | --- |
