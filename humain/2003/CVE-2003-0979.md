FreeScripts VisitorBook LE (visitorbook.pl) does not properly escape line breaks in input, which allows remote attackers to (1) use VisitorBook as an open mail relay, when $mailuser is 1, via extra headers in the email field, or (2) cause the guestbook database to be deleted via a large number of line breaks that exceeds the $max_posts variable.
