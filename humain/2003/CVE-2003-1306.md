Microsoft URLScan 2.5, with the RemoveServerHeader option enabled, allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (server name and version) via an HTTP request that generates certain errors such as 400 "Bad Request," which leak the Server header in the response. Successful exploitation requires that the RemoveServerHeader option is enabled.
