# CVE-2003-1201

- Published: 2003-03-20T05:00:00

ldbm_back_exop_passwd in the back-ldbm backend in passwd.c for OpenLDAP 2.1.12 and earlier, when the slap_passwd_parse function does not return LDAP_SUCCESS, attempts to free an uninitialized pointer, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault). This was fixed in OpenLDAP version 2.1.17.
