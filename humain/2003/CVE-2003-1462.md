- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:29:00

mod_survey 3.0.0 through 3.0.15-pre6 does not check whether a survey exists before creating a subdirectory for it, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disk consumption and possible crash).

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
