# CVE-2003-1132

- Published: 2003-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T20:36:00

The DNS server for Cisco Content Service Switch (CSS) 11000 and 11500, when prompted for a nonexistent AAAA record, responds with response code 3 (NXDOMAIN or "Name Error") instead of response code 0 ("No Error"), which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (inaccessible domain) by forcing other DNS servers to send and cache a request for a AAAA record to the vulnerable server.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
