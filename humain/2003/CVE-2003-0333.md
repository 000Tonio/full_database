Multiple buffer overflows in kermit in HP-UX 10.20 and 11.00 (C-Kermit 6.0.192 and possibly other versions before 8.0) allow local users to gain privileges via long arguments to (1) ask, (2) askq, (3) define, (4) assign, and (5) getc, some of which may share the same underlying function "doask," a different vulnerability than CVE-2001-0085.
