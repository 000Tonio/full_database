- Published: 2003-06-09T04:00:00

- Modified: 2016-10-18T02:32:00

The ISAPI extension in BadBlue 1.7 through 2.2, and possibly earlier versions, modifies the first two letters of a filename extension after performing a security check, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a filename with a .ats extension instead of a .hts extension.

| --- | --- | --- |
