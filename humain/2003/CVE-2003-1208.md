# CVE-2003-1208

- Published: 2004-12-03T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:29:00

Multiple buffer overflows in Oracle 9i 9 before 9.2.0.3 allow local users to execute arbitrary code by (1) setting the TIME_ZONE session parameter to a long value, or providing long parameters to the (2) NUMTOYMINTERVAL, (3) NUMTODSINTERVAL or (4) FROM_TZ functions. This was fixed in Oracle 9i Database Release 2, version 9.2.0.3.
