Sun Cluster 2.2 through 3.2 for Oracle Parallel Server / Real Application Clusters (OPS/RAC) allows local users to cause a denial of service (cluster node panic or abort) by launching a daemon listening on a TCP port that would otherwise be used by the Distributed Lock Manager (DLM), possibly involving this daemon responding in a manner that spoofs a cluster reconfiguration.
