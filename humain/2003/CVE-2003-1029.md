# CVE-2003-1029

- Published: 2004-02-17T05:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:29:00

The L2TP protocol parser in tcpdump 3.8.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and memory consumption) via a packet with invalid data to UDP port 1701, which causes l2tp_avp_print to use a bad length value when calling print_octets.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
