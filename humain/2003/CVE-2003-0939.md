eo420_GetStringFromVarPart in veo420.c for SAP database server (SAP DB) 7.4.03.27 and earlier may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a connect packet with a 256 byte segment to the niserver (aka serv.exe) process on TCP port 7269, which prevents the server from NULL terminating the string and leads to a buffer overflow.
