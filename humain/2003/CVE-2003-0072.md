The Key Distribution Center (KDC) in Kerberos 5 (krb5) 1.2.7 and earlier allows remote, authenticated attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) on KDCs within the same realm using a certain protocol request that causes an out-of-bounds read of an array (aka "array overrun").

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
