Multiple buffer overflows in SmartFTP 1.0.973, and other versions before 1.0.976, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a long response to a PWD command, which triggers a stack-based overflow, and (2) a long line in a response to a file LIST command, which triggers a heap-based overflow.
