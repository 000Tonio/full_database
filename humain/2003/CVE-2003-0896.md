# CVE-2003-0896

- Published: 2003-11-17T05:00:00

The loadClass method of the sun.applet.AppletClassLoader class in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) in Sun SDK and JRE 1.4.1_03 and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass sandbox restrictions and execute arbitrary code via a loaded class name that contains "/" (slash) instead of "." (dot) characters, which bypasses a call to the Security Manager's checkPackageAccess method.
