Microsoft Internet Explorer allows remote attackers to bypass intended cookie access restrictions on a web application via "%2e%2e" (encoded dot dot) directory traversal sequences in a URL, which causes Internet Explorer to send the cookie outside the specified URL subsets, e.g. to a vulnerable application that runs on the same server as the target application.
