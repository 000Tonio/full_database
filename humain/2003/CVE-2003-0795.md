# CVE-2003-0795

- Published: 2003-12-15T05:00:00

- Modified: 2016-10-18T02:37:00

The vty layer in Quagga before 0.96.4, and Zebra 0.93b and earlier, does not verify that sub-negotiation is taking place when processing the SE marker, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a malformed telnet command to the telnet CLI port, which may trigger a null dereference.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
