The hanterm (hanterm-xf) terminal emulator 2.0.5 and earlier, and possibly later versions, allows attackers to modify the window title via a certain character escape sequence and then insert it back to the command line in the user's terminal, e.g. when the user views a file containing the malicious sequence, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
