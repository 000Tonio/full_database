# CVE-2003-0094

- Published: 2003-03-03T05:00:00

A patch for mcookie in the util-linux package for Mandrake Linux 8.2 and 9.0 uses /dev/urandom instead of /dev/random, which causes mcookie to use an entropy source that is more predictable than expected, which may make it easier for certain types of attacks to succeed.
