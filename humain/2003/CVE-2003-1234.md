# CVE-2003-1234

- Published: 2003-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:29:00

Integer overflow in the f_count counter in FreeBSD before 4.2 through 5.0 allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via multiple calls to (1) fpathconf and (2) lseek, which do not properly decrement f_count through a call to fdrop.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
