# CVE-2003-1564

- Published: 2003-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2008-10-24T04:30:00

libxml2, possibly before 2.5.0, does not properly detect recursion during entity expansion, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory and CPU consumption) via a crafted XML document containing a large number of nested entity references, aka the "billion laughs attack."

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
