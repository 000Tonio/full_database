The l3-agent in OpenStack Neutron 2012.2 before 2013.2.3 does not check the tenant id when creating ports, which allows remote authenticated users to plug ports into the routers of arbitrary tenants via the device id in a port-create command.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
