# CVE-2014-3940

- Published: 2014-06-05T17:55:00

- Modified: 2019-04-22T17:48:00

The Linux kernel through 3.14.5 does not properly consider the presence of hugetlb entries, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or system crash) by accessing certain memory locations, as demonstrated by triggering a race condition via numa_maps read operations during hugepage migration, related to fs/proc/task_mmu.c and mm/mempolicy.c.

### CVSS Score: **4**
