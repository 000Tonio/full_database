# CVE-2014-2922

- Published: 2014-04-21T22:55:00

- Modified: 2014-04-22T15:06:00

The getObjectByToken function in Newsletter.php in the Pimcore_Tool_Newsletter module in pimcore 1.4.9 through 2.1.0 does not properly handle an object obtained by unserializing a pathname, which allows remote attackers to conduct PHP object injection attacks and delete arbitrary files via vectors involving a Zend_Http_Response_Stream object.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
