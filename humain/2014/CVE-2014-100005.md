Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in D-Link DIR-600 router (rev. Bx) with firmware before 2.17b02 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) create an administrator account or (2) enable remote management via a crafted configuration module to hedwig.cgi, (3) activate new configuration settings via a SETCFG,SAVE,ACTIVATE action to pigwidgeon.cgi, or (4) send a ping via a ping action to diagnostic.php.
