# CVE-2014-8949

The iMember360 plugin 3.8.012 through 3.9.001 for WordPress allows remote authenticated administrators to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in the i4w_trace parameter.  NOTE: this can be leveraged with CVE-2014-8948 to allow remote attackers to execute code.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue itself crosses privileges.
