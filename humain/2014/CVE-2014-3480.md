# CVE-2014-3480

- Published: 2014-07-09T11:07:00

- Modified: 2022-10-28T23:25:00

The cdf_count_chain function in cdf.c in file before 5.19, as used in the Fileinfo component in PHP before 5.4.30 and 5.5.x before 5.5.14, does not properly validate sector-count data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted CDF file.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
