# CVE-2014-3535

- Published: 2014-09-28T19:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:40:00

include/linux/netdevice.h in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36 incorrectly uses macros for netdev_printk and its related logging implementation, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) by sending invalid packets to a VxLAN interface.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
