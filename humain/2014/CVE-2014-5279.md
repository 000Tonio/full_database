# CVE-2014-5279

- Published: 2018-02-06T16:29:00

- Modified: 2019-04-29T17:14:00

The Docker daemon managed by boot2docker 1.2 and earlier improperly enables unauthenticated TCP connections by default, which makes it easier for remote attackers to gain privileges or execute arbitrary code from children containers.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
