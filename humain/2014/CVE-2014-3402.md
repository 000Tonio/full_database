The authentication-manager process in the web framework in Cisco Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) 7.0(8)E4 and earlier in Cisco Intrusion Detection System (IDS) does not properly manage user tokens, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (temporary MainApp hang) via a crafted connection request to the management interface, aka Bug ID CSCuq39550.
