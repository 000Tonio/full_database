Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) 2.0, 2.1, and 3.0, when a configured SAML Relying Party lacks a sign-out endpoint, does not properly process logoff actions, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access by leveraging an unattended workstation, aka "Active Directory Federation Services Information Disclosure Vulnerability."
