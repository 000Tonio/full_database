# CVE-2014-1263

- Published: 2014-02-27T01:55:00

- Modified: 2014-05-05T05:32:00

curl and libcurl 7.27.0 through 7.35.0, when using the SecureTransport/Darwinssl backend, as used in in Apple OS X 10.9.x before 10.9.2, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate when accessing a URL that uses a numerical IP address, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
