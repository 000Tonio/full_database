- Published: 2015-02-13T15:59:00

- Modified: 2017-09-08T01:29:00

The org.jboss.security.plugins.mapping.JBossMappingManager implementation in JBoss Security in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) before 6.3.3 uses the default security domain when a security domain is undefined, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging credentials on the default domain for a role that is also on the application domain.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
