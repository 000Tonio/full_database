# CVE-2014-2309

- Published: 2014-03-11T13:01:00

- Modified: 2020-08-27T17:04:00

The ip6_route_add function in net/ipv6/route.c in the Linux kernel through 3.13.6 does not properly count the addition of routes, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a flood of ICMPv6 Router Advertisement packets.

### CVSS Score: **6.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
