The raw_decode function in libavcodec/rawdec.c in FFMpeg before 2.1.6, 2.2.x through 2.3.x, and 2.4.x before 2.4.4 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds heap access) and possibly have other unspecified impact via a crafted .cine file that triggers the avpicture_get_size function to return a negative frame size.
