The System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) 1.11.6 does not properly identify group membership when a non-POSIX group is in a group membership chain, which allows local users to bypass access restrictions via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **3.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
