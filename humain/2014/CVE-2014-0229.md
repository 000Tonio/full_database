Apache Hadoop 0.23.x before 0.23.11 and 2.x before 2.4.1, as used in Cloudera CDH 5.0.x before 5.0.2, do not check authorization for the (1) refreshNamenodes, (2) deleteBlockPool, and (3) shutdownDatanode HDFS admin commands, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (DataNodes shutdown) or perform unnecessary operations by issuing a command.

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
