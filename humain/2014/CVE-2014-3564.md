Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in the status_handler function in (1) engine-gpgsm.c and (2) engine-uiserver.c in GPGME before 1.5.1 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors related to "different line lengths in a specific order."

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
