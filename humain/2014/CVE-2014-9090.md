# CVE-2014-9090

- Published: 2014-11-30T01:59:00

- Modified: 2015-06-04T02:01:00

The do_double_fault function in arch/x86/kernel/traps.c in the Linux kernel through 3.17.4 does not properly handle faults associated with the Stack Segment (SS) segment register, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) via a modify_ldt system call, as demonstrated by sigreturn_32 in the linux-clock-tests test suite.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
