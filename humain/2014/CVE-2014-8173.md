# CVE-2014-8173

- Published: 2015-03-16T10:59:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:44:00

The pmd_none_or_trans_huge_or_clear_bad function in include/asm-generic/pgtable.h in the Linux kernel before 3.13 on NUMA systems does not properly determine whether a Page Middle Directory (PMD) entry is a transparent huge-table entry, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted MADV_WILLNEED madvise system call that leverages the absence of a page-table lock.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
