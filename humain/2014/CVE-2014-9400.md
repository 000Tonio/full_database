Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the Wp Unique Article Header Image plugin 1.0 and earlier for WordPress allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via the (1) gt_default_header or (2) gt_homepage_header parameter in the wp-unique-header.php page to wp-admin/options-general.php.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
