NOTE: the previous information is from the January 2015 CPU. Oracle has not commented on the original researcher's claim that this is an XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in the XML parser, which allows attackers to conduct internal port scanning, perform SSRF attacks, or cause a denial of service via a crafted (1) http: or (2) ftp: URI. Per: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpujan2015-1972971.html
