Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Project Issue File Review module (PIFR) module 6.x-2.x before 6.x-2.17 for Drupal allow (1) remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted patch, which triggers a PIFR client to test the patch and return the results to the PIFR_Server test results page or (2) remote authenticated users with the "manage PIFR environments" permission to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving a PIFR_Server administrative page.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
