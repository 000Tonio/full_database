The XML parser in Microsoft Office 2007 SP3, 2010 SP1 and SP2, and 2013, and Office for Mac 2011, does not properly detect recursion during entity expansion, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and persistent application hang) via a crafted XML document containing a large number of nested entity references, as demonstrated by a crafted text/plain e-mail message to Outlook, a similar issue to CVE-2003-1564.
