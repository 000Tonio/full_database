# CVE-2014-8475

- Published: 2014-11-18T15:59:00

- Modified: 2017-09-08T01:29:00

FreeBSD 9.1, 9.2, and 10.0, when compiling OpenSSH with Kerberos support, uses incorrect library ordering when linking sshd, which causes symbols to be resolved incorrectly and allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (sshd deadlock and prevention of new connections) by ending multiple connections before authentication is completed.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
