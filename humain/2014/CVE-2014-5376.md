Adaptive Computing Moab before 7.2.9 and 8 before 8.0.0, when a pre-generated key is used, does not validate that the requesting user matches the actor in the message, which allows remote authenticated users to impersonate arbitrary users via the actor field in a message.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |
