# CVE-2014-3534

- Published: 2014-08-01T11:13:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:40:00

arch/s390/kernel/ptrace.c in the Linux kernel before 3.15.8 on the s390 platform does not properly restrict address-space control operations in PTRACE_POKEUSR_AREA requests, which allows local users to obtain read and write access to kernel memory locations, and consequently gain privileges, via a crafted application that makes a ptrace system call.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
