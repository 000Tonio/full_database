Zend Framework 1 (ZF1) before 1.12.4, Zend Framework 2 before 2.1.6 and 2.2.x before 2.2.6, ZendOpenId, ZendRest, ZendService_AudioScrobbler, ZendService_Nirvanix, ZendService_SlideShare, ZendService_Technorati, and ZendService_WindowsAzure before 2.0.2, ZendService_Amazon before 2.0.3, and ZendService_Api before 1.0.0, when PHP-FPM is used, does not properly share the libxml_disable_entity_loader setting between threads, which might allow remote attackers to conduct XML External Entity (XXE) attacks via an XML external entity declaration in conjunction with an entity reference.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-5657.
