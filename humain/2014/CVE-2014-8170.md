- Published: 2017-09-26T01:29:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:44:00

ovirt_safe_delete_config in ovirtfunctions.py and other unspecified locations in ovirt-node 3.0.0-474-gb852fd7 as packaged in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 3 do not properly quote input strings, which allows remote authenticated users and physically proximate attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a ; (semicolon) in an input string.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
