The Storage and Access service in BlackBerry OS 10.x before 10.2.1.1925 on Q5, Q10, Z10, and Z30 devices does not enforce the password requirement for SMB filesystem access, which allows context-dependent attackers to read arbitrary files via (1) a session over a Wi-Fi network or (2) a session over a USB connection in Development Mode.

### CVSS Score: **6.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
