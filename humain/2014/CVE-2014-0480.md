# CVE-2014-0480

- Published: 2014-08-26T14:55:00

The core.urlresolvers.reverse function in Django before 1.4.14, 1.5.x before 1.5.9, 1.6.x before 1.6.6, and 1.7 before release candidate 3 does not properly validate URLs, which allows remote attackers to conduct phishing attacks via a // (slash slash) in a URL, which triggers a scheme-relative URL to be generated.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
