fastfat.sys (aka the FASTFAT driver) in the kernel-mode drivers in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP2, Vista SP2, and Server 2008 SP2 does not properly allocate memory, which allows physically proximate attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (reserved-memory write) by connecting a crafted USB device, aka "Microsoft Windows Disk Partition Driver Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability."
