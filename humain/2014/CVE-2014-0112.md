# CVE-2014-0112

- Published: 2014-04-29T10:37:00

- Modified: 2019-08-12T21:15:00

ParametersInterceptor in Apache Struts before 2.3.20 does not properly restrict access to the getClass method, which allows remote attackers to "manipulate" the ClassLoader and execute arbitrary code via a crafted request. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-0094.
