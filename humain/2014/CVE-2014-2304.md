A vulnerability in version 0.90 of the Open Floodlight SDN controller software could result in a denial of service attack and crashing of the controller service. This effect is the result of a flaw in OpenFlow protocol processing, where specific malformed and mistimed FEATURES_REPLY messages cause the controller service to not delete switch and port data from its internal tracking structures.
