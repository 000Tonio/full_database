Google V8, as used in Google Chrome before 34.0.1847.131 on Windows and OS X and before 34.0.1847.132 on Linux, does not properly store internationalization metadata, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging "type confusion" and reading property values, related to i18n.js and runtime.cc.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
