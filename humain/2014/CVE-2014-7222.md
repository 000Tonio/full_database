Buffer overflow in TeamSpeak Client 3.0.14 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (application crash) by connecting to a channel with a different client instance, and placing crafted data in the Chat/Server tab with two \\ (backslash) characters, a digit, a \ (backslash) character, and "z" in a series of nested img BBCODE tags.

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
