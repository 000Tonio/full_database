# CVE-2014-0476

- Published: 2014-10-25T22:55:00

- Modified: 2017-09-19T01:36:00

The slapper function in chkrootkit before 0.50 does not properly quote file paths, which allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a Trojan horse executable.  NOTE: this is only a vulnerability when /tmp is not mounted with the noexec option.
