Tornado before 3.2.2 sends arbitrary responses that contain a fixed CSRF token and may be sent with HTTP compression, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct a BREACH attack and determine this token via a series of crafted requests.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
