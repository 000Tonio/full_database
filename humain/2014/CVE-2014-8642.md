# CVE-2014-8642

- Published: 2015-01-14T11:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

Mozilla Firefox before 35.0 and SeaMonkey before 2.32 do not consider the id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck extension in deciding whether to trust an OCSP responder, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network during a session in which there was an incorrect decision to accept a compromised and revoked certificate.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
