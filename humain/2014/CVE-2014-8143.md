Samba 4.0.x before 4.0.24, 4.1.x before 4.1.16, and 4.2.x before 4.2rc4, when an Active Directory Domain Controller (AD DC) is configured, allows remote authenticated users to set the LDB userAccountControl UF_SERVER_TRUST_ACCOUNT bit, and consequently gain privileges, by leveraging delegation of authority for user-account or computer-account creation.

### CVSS Score: **8.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
