# CVE-2014-2573

- Published: 2014-03-25T16:55:00

- Modified: 2014-03-26T13:41:00

The VMWare driver in OpenStack Compute (Nova) 2013.2 through 2013.2.2 does not properly put VMs into RESCUE status, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass the quota limit and cause a denial of service (resource consumption) by requesting the VM be put into rescue and then deleting the image.

### CVSS Score: **2.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
