# CVE-2014-1928

- Published: 2014-10-25T21:55:00

- Modified: 2014-10-27T19:24:00

The shell_quote function in python-gnupg 0.3.5 does not properly escape characters, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via shell metacharacters in unspecified vectors, as demonstrated using "\" (backslash) characters to form multi-command sequences, a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-1927.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7323.
