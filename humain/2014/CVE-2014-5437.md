Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in ARRIS Touchstone TG862G/CT Telephony Gateway with firmware 7.6.59S.CT and earlier allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) enable remote management via a request to remote_management.php, (2) add a port forwarding rule via a request to port_forwarding_add.php, (3) change the wireless network to open via a request to wireless_network_configuration_edit.php, or (4) conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via the keyword parameter to managed_sites_add_keyword.php.
