The hardware VPN client in Viprinet MultichannelVPN Router 300 version 2013070830/2013080900 does not validate the remote VPN endpoint identity (through the checking of the endpoint's SSL key) before initiating the exchange, which allows remote attackers to perform a replay attack.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
