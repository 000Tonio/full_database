Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in PNP4Nagios through 0.6.22 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the URI used for reaching (1) share/pnp/application/views/kohana_error_page.php or (2) share/pnp/application/views/template.php, leading to improper handling within an http-equiv="refresh" META element.
