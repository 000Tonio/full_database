# CVE-2014-3879

- Published: 2020-02-18T17:15:00

OpenPAM Nummularia 9.2 through 10.0 does not properly handle the error reported when an include directive refers to a policy that does not exist, which causes the loaded policy chain to no be discarded and allows context-dependent attackers to bypass authentication via a login (1) without a password or (2) with an incorrect password.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
