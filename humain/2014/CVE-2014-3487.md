- Published: 2014-07-09T11:07:00

- Modified: 2022-10-28T23:21:00

The cdf_read_property_info function in file before 5.19, as used in the Fileinfo component in PHP before 5.4.30 and 5.5.x before 5.5.14, does not properly validate a stream offset, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted CDF file.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
