Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the Simplelife plugin 1.2 and earlier for WordPress allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via the (1) simplehoverback, (2) simplehovertext, (3) flickrback, or (4) simple_flimit parameter in the simplelife.php page to wp-admin/options-general.php.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
