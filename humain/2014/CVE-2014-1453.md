# CVE-2014-1453

- Published: 2014-04-16T18:37:00

- Modified: 2019-03-18T15:35:00

The NFS server (nfsserver) in FreeBSD 8.3 through 10.0 does not acquire locks in the proper order when converting a directory file handle to a vnode, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (deadlock) via vectors involving a thread that uses the correct locking order.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
