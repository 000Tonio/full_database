- Published: 2014-10-18T01:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:35:00

fdesetup in Apple OS X before 10.10 does not properly display the encryption status in between a setting-update action and a reboot action, which might make it easier for physically proximate attackers to obtain cleartext data by leveraging ignorance of the reboot requirement.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |
