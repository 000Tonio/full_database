Multiple integer overflows in TrueCrypt 7.1a allow local users to (1) obtain sensitive information via vectors involving a crafted item->OriginalLength value in the MainThreadProc function in EncryptedIoQueue.c or (2) cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via vectors involving large StartingOffset and Length values in the ProcessVolumeDeviceControlIrp function in Ntdriver.c.
