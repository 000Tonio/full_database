# CVE-2014-3707

- Published: 2014-11-15T20:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

The curl_easy_duphandle function in libcurl 7.17.1 through 7.38.0, when running with the CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS option, does not properly copy HTTP POST data for an easy handle, which triggers an out-of-bounds read that allows remote web servers to read sensitive memory information.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
