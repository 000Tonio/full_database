Mail in Apple iOS before 7.1.2 advertises the availability of data protection for attachments but stores cleartext attachments under mobile/Library/Mail/, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive information by mounting the data partition.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
