EMC RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite (MES) 4.0.x before 4.0.6 and RSA BSAFE SSL-J before 6.1.4 do not ensure that a server's X.509 certificate is the same during renegotiation as it was before renegotiation, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain sensitive information or modify TLS session data via a "triple handshake attack."

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
