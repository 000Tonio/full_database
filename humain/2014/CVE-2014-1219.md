CA 2E Web Option r8.1.2 accepts a predictable substring of a W2E_SSNID session token in place of the entire token, which allows remote attackers to hijack sessions by changing characters at the end of this substring, as demonstrated by terminating a session via a modified SSNID parameter to web2edoc/close.htm.
