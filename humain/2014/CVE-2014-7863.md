# CVE-2014-7863

- Published: 2020-02-08T17:15:00

- Modified: 2020-02-13T16:30:00

The FailOverHelperServlet (aka FailServlet) servlet in ZOHO ManageEngine Applications Manager before 11.9 build 11912, OpManager 8 through 11.5 build 11400, and IT360 10.5 and earlier does not properly restrict access, which allows remote attackers and remote authenticated users to (1) read arbitrary files via the fileName parameter in a copyfile operation or (2) obtain sensitive information via a directory listing in a listdirectory operation to servlet/FailOverHelperServlet.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
