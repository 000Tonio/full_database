The ThemePunch Slider Revolution (revslider) plugin before 3.0.96 for WordPress and Showbiz Pro plugin 1.7.1 and earlier for Wordpress does not properly restrict access to administrator AJAX functionality, which allows remote attackers to (1) upload and execute arbitrary files via an update_plugin action; (2) delete arbitrary sliders via a delete_slider action; and (3) create, (4) update, (5) import, or (6) export arbitrary sliders via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
