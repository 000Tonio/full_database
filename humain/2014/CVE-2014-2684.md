# CVE-2014-2684

- Published: 2014-11-16T00:59:00

- Modified: 2017-11-04T01:29:00

The GenericConsumer class in the Consumer component in ZendOpenId before 2.0.2 and the Zend_OpenId_Consumer class in Zend Framework 1 before 1.12.4 does not verify that the openid_op_endpoint value identifies the same Identity Provider as the provider used in the association handle, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and spoof arbitrary OpenID identities by using a malicious OpenID Provider that generates OpenID tokens with arbitrary identifier and claimed_id values.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
