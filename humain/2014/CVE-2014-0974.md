The boot_linux_from_mmc function in app/aboot/aboot.c in the Little Kernel (LK) bootloader, as distributed with Qualcomm Innovation Center (QuIC) Android contributions for MSM devices and other products, does not properly validate a certain address value, which allows attackers to write data to a controllable memory location by leveraging the ability to initiate an attempted boot of an arbitrary image.
