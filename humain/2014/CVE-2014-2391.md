# CVE-2014-2391

- Published: 2014-04-24T05:06:00

The password recovery service in Open-Xchange AppSuite before 7.2.2-rev20, 7.4.1 before 7.4.1-rev11, and 7.4.2 before 7.4.2-rev13 makes an improper decision about the sensitivity of a string representing a previously used but currently invalid password, which allows remote attackers to obtain potentially useful password-pattern information by reading (1) a web-server access log, (2) a web-server Referer log, or (3) browser history that contains this string because of its presence in a GET request.
