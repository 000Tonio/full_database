The Googlemaps plugin 3.2 and earlier for Joomla! allows remote attackers with control of a sub-domain belonging to a victim domain to cause a denial of service via the 'url' parameter to plugin_googlemap3_kmlprxy.php.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7428.
