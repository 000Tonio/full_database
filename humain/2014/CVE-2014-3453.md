# CVE-2014-3453

- Published: 2014-05-17T19:55:00

- Modified: 2014-05-19T16:32:00

Eval injection vulnerability in the flag_import_form_validate function in includes/flag.export.inc in the Flag module 7.x-3.0, 7.x-3.5, and earlier for Drupal allows remote authenticated administrators to execute arbitrary PHP code via the "Flag import code" text area to admin/structure/flags/import.  NOTE: this issue could also be exploited by other attackers if the administrator ignores a security warning on the permissions assignment page.
