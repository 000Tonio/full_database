The L3 agent in OpenStack Neutron 2014.2.x before 2014.2.2, when using radvd 2.0+, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (blocked router update processing) by creating eight routers and assigning an ipv6 non-provider subnet to each.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
