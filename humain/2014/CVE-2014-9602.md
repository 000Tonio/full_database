libavcodec/xface.h in FFmpeg before 2.5.2 establishes certain digits and words array dimensions that do not satisfy a required mathematical relationship, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted X-Face image data.
