Yann Collet LZ4 before r119, when used on certain 32-bit platforms that allocate memory beyond 0x80000000, does not properly detect integer overflows, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted Literal Run, a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-4611.
