# CVE-2014-3538

- Published: 2014-07-03T14:55:00

- Modified: 2023-01-19T16:34:00

file before 5.19 does not properly restrict the amount of data read during a regex search, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted file that triggers backtracking during processing of an awk rule.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-7345.
