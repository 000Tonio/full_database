# CVE-2014-0603

- Published: 2015-02-06T11:59:00

- Modified: 2015-02-09T14:05:00

The rftpcom.dll ActiveX control in Attachmate Reflection FTP Client before 14.1.429 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) and execute arbitrary code via vectors related to the (1) GetGlobalSettings or (2) GetSiteProperties3 methods, which triggers a dereference of an arbitrary memory address.  NOTE: this issue was MERGED with CVE-2014-0606 because it is the same type of vulnerability, affecting the same set of versions, and discovered by the same researcher.
