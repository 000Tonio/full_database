# CVE-2014-5270

- Published: 2014-10-10T01:55:00

- Modified: 2017-11-04T01:29:00

Libgcrypt before 1.5.4, as used in GnuPG and other products, does not properly perform ciphertext normalization and ciphertext randomization, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to conduct key-extraction attacks by leveraging the ability to collect voltage data from exposed metal, a different vector than CVE-2013-4576.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
