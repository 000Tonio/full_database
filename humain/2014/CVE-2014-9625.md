The GetUpdateFile function in misc/update.c in the Updater in VideoLAN VLC media player before 2.1.6 performs an incorrect cast operation from a 64-bit integer to a 32-bit integer, which allows remote attackers to conduct buffer overflow attacks and execute arbitrary code via a crafted update status file, aka an "integer truncation" vulnerability.
