# CVE-2014-7853

- Published: 2015-02-13T15:59:00

- Modified: 2017-09-08T01:29:00

The JBoss Application Server (WildFly) JacORB subsystem in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) before 6.3.3 does not properly assign socket-binding-ref sensitivity classification to the security-domain attribute, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information by leveraging access to the security-domain attribute.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
