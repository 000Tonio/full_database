The ServerTrustManager component in the Ignite Realtime Smack XMPP API before 4.0.0-rc1 does not verify basicConstraints and nameConstraints in X.509 certificate chains from SSL servers, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate chain.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| --- | --- | --- |
