Use-after-free vulnerability in the xc_cpupool_getinfo function in Xen 4.1.x through 4.3.x, when using a multithreaded toolstack, does not properly handle a failure by the xc_cpumap_alloc function, which allows local users with access to management functions to cause a denial of service (heap corruption) and possibly gain privileges via unspecified vectors.
