WebKit, as used in Apple Safari before 6.1.4 and 7.x before 7.0.4, does not properly interpret Unicode encoding, which allows remote attackers to spoof a postMessage origin, and bypass intended restrictions on sending a message to a connected frame or window, via crafted characters in a URL.

### CVSS Score: **5**
