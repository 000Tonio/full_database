- Published: 2014-12-01T15:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

The acceleration support for the "REP MOVS" instruction in Xen 4.4.x, 3.2.x, and earlier lacks properly bounds checking for memory mapped I/O (MMIO) emulated in the hypervisor, which allows local HVM guests to cause a denial of service (host crash) via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
