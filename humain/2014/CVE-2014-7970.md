# CVE-2014-7970

- Published: 2014-10-13T10:55:00

- Modified: 2020-08-14T18:14:00

The pivot_root implementation in fs/namespace.c in the Linux kernel through 3.17 does not properly interact with certain locations of a chroot directory, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (mount-tree loop) via . (dot) values in both arguments to the pivot_root system call.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
