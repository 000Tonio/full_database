Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the XML-RPC API in the Desktop Client in OpenVPN Access Server 1.5.6 and earlier allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) disconnecting established VPN sessions, (2) connect to arbitrary VPN servers, or (3) create VPN profiles and execute arbitrary commands via crafted API requests.
