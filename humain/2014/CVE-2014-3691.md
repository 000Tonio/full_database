Smart Proxy (aka Smart-Proxy and foreman-proxy) in Foreman before 1.5.4 and 1.6.x before 1.6.2 does not validate SSL certificates, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended authentication and execute arbitrary API requests via a request without a certificate.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
