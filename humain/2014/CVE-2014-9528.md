SQL injection vulnerability in the actionIndex function in protected/modules_core/notification/controllers/ListController.php in HumHub 0.10.0-rc.1 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the from parameter to index.php. NOTE: this can be leveraged for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a request that causes an error.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
