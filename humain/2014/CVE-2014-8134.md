# CVE-2014-8134

- Published: 2014-12-12T18:59:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:43:00

The paravirt_ops_setup function in arch/x86/kernel/kvm.c in the Linux kernel through 3.18 uses an improper paravirt_enabled setting for KVM guest kernels, which makes it easier for guest OS users to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via a crafted application that reads a 16-bit value.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
