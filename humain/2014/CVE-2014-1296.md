CFNetwork in Apple iOS before 7.1.1, Apple OS X through 10.9.2, and Apple TV before 6.1.1 does not ensure that a Set-Cookie HTTP header is complete before interpreting the header's value, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by triggering the closing of a TCP connection during transmission of a header, as demonstrated by an HTTPOnly restriction.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
