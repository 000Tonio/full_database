Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the Disqus Comment System plugin 2.77 for WordPress allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) activate or (2) deactivate the plugin via the active parameter to wp-admin/edit-comments.php, (3) import comments via an import_comments action, or (4) export comments via an export_comments action to wp-admin/index.php.
