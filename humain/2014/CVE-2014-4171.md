# CVE-2014-4171

- Published: 2014-06-23T11:21:00

- Modified: 2018-12-18T14:38:00

mm/shmem.c in the Linux kernel through 3.15.1 does not properly implement the interaction between range notification and hole punching, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (i_mutex hold) by using the mmap system call to access a hole, as demonstrated by interfering with intended shmem activity by blocking completion of (1) an MADV_REMOVE madvise call or (2) an FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE fallocate call.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
