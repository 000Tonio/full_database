Apple iOS before 8.1.1 does not properly enforce the failed-passcode limit, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to bypass the lock-screen protection mechanism via a series of guesses.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
