cn.wps.moffice.common.beans.print.CloudPrintWebView in Kingsoft Office 5.3.1, as used in Huawei P2 devices before V100R001C00B043, falls back to HTTP when the HTTPS connection to the registry fails, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to conduct downgrade attacks and execute arbitrary Java code by leveraging a network position between the client and the registry to block HTTPS traffic.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
