# CVE-2014-8154

- Published: 2015-01-27T20:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

The Gst.MapInfo function in Vala 0.26.0 and 0.26.1 uses an incorrect buffer length declaration for the Gstreamer bindings, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors, which trigger a heap-based buffer overflow.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
