# CVE-2014-3657

- Published: 2014-10-06T14:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:41:00

The virDomainListPopulate function in conf/domain_conf.c in libvirt before 1.2.9 does not clean up the lock on the list of domains, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (deadlock) via a NULL value in the second parameter in the virConnectListAllDomains API command.

### CVSS Score: **5**
