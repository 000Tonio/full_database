Docker Engine before 1.8.3 and CS Docker Engine before 1.6.2-CS7 do not use a globally unique identifier to store image layers, which makes it easier for attackers to poison the image cache via a crafted image in pull or push commands.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
