vmstate_xhci_event in hw/usb/hcd-xhci.c in QEMU 1.6.0 does not terminate the list with the VMSTATE_END_OF_LIST macro, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds access, infinite loop, and memory corruption) and possibly gain privileges via unspecified vectors.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
