# CVE-2014-1731

- Published: 2014-04-26T10:55:00

- Modified: 2022-11-10T17:58:00

core/html/HTMLSelectElement.cpp in the DOM implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 34.0.1847.131 on Windows and OS X and before 34.0.1847.132 on Linux, does not properly check renderer state upon a focus event, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors that leverage "type confusion" for SELECT elements.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
