Off-by-one error in the flask_security_avc_cachestats function in xsm/flask/flask_op.c in Xen 4.2.x and 4.3.x, when the maximum number of physical CPUs are in use, allows local users to cause a denial of service (host crash) or obtain sensitive information from hypervisor memory by leveraging a FLASK_AVC_CACHESTAT hypercall, which triggers a buffer over-read.
