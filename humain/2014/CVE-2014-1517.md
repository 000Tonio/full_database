# CVE-2014-1517

- Published: 2014-04-20T01:55:00

- Modified: 2016-04-04T17:41:00

The login form in Bugzilla 2.x, 3.x, 4.x before 4.4.3, and 4.5.x before 4.5.3 does not properly handle a correctly authenticated but unintended login attempt, which makes it easier for remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information by arranging for a victim to login to the attacker's account and then submit a vulnerability report, related to a "login CSRF" issue.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
