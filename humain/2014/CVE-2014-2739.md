The cma_req_handler function in drivers/infiniband/core/cma.c in the Linux kernel 3.14.x through 3.14.1 attempts to resolve an RDMA over Converged Ethernet (aka RoCE) address that is properly resolved within a different module, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect pointer dereference and system crash) via crafted network traffic.
