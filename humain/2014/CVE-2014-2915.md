Xen 4.4.x, when running on ARM systems, does not properly restrict access to hardware features, which allows local guest users to cause a denial of service (host or guest crash) via unspecified vectors, related to (1) cache control, (2) coprocessors, (3) debug registers, and (4) other unspecified registers.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
