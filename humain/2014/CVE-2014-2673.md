The arch_dup_task_struct function in the Transactional Memory (TM) implementation in arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c in the Linux kernel before 3.13.7 on the powerpc platform does not properly interact with the clone and fork system calls, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (Program Check and system crash) via certain instructions that are executed with the processor in the Transactional state.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
