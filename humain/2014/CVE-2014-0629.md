EMC Documentum TaskSpace (TSP) 6.7SP1 before P25 and 6.7SP2 before P11 does not properly handle the interaction between the dm_world group and the dm_superusers_dynamic group, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information and gain privileges in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging an incorrect group-addition implementation.

### CVSS Score: **8.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
