The RenderTable::simplifiedNormalFlowLayout function in core/rendering/RenderTable.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.91, skips captions during table layout in certain situations, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via unspecified vectors related to the Fonts implementation.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
