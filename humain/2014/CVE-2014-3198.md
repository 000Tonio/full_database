# CVE-2014-3198

- Published: 2014-10-08T10:55:00

- Modified: 2016-11-28T19:11:00

The Instance::HandleInputEvent function in pdf/instance.cc in the PDFium component in Google Chrome before 38.0.2125.101 interprets a certain -1 value as an index instead of a no-visible-page error code, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
