# CVE-2014-2281

- Published: 2014-03-11T13:01:00

- Modified: 2015-08-12T17:42:00

The nfs_name_snoop_add_name function in epan/dissectors/packet-nfs.c in the NFS dissector in Wireshark 1.8.x before 1.8.13 and 1.10.x before 1.10.6 does not validate a certain length value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via a crafted NFS packet.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
