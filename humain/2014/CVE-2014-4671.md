Adobe Flash Player before 13.0.0.231 and 14.x before 14.0.0.145 on Windows and OS X and before 11.2.202.394 on Linux, Adobe AIR before 14.0.0.137 on Android, Adobe AIR SDK before 14.0.0.137, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 14.0.0.137 do not properly restrict the SWF file format, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks against JSONP endpoints, and obtain sensitive information, via a crafted OBJECT element with SWF content satisfying the character-set requirements of a callback API.
