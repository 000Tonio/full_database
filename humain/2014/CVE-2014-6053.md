# CVE-2014-6053

- Published: 2014-12-15T18:59:00

- Modified: 2020-10-23T13:15:00

The rfbProcessClientNormalMessage function in libvncserver/rfbserver.c in LibVNCServer 0.9.9 and earlier does not properly handle attempts to send a large amount of ClientCutText data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or daemon crash) via a crafted message that is processed by using a single unchecked malloc.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
