X.Org X Window System (aka X11 and X) X11R5 and X.Org Server (aka xserver and xorg-server) before 1.16.3, when using SUN-DES-1 (Secure RPC) authentication credentials, does not check the return value of a malloc call, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and server crash) via a crafted connection request.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
