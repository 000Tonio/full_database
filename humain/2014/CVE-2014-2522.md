# CVE-2014-2522

- Published: 2014-04-18T22:14:00

- Modified: 2017-04-29T01:59:00

curl and libcurl 7.27.0 through 7.35.0, when running on Windows and using the SChannel/Winssl TLS backend, does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate when accessing a URL that uses a numerical IP address, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
