The D-Bus security policy files in /etc/dbus-1/system.d/*.conf in fso-gsmd 0.12.0-3, fso-frameworkd 0.9.5.9+git20110512-4, and fso-usaged 0.12.0-2 as packaged in Debian, the upstream cornucopia.git (fsoaudiod, fsodatad, fsodeviced, fsogsmd, fsonetworkd, fsotdld, fsousaged) git master on 2015-01-19, the upstream framework.git 0.10.1 and git master on 2015-01-19, phonefsod 0.1+git20121018-1 as packaged in Debian, Ubuntu and potentially other packages, and potentially other fso modules do not properly filter D-Bus message paths, which might allow local users to cause a denial of service (dbus-daemon memory consumption), or execute arbitrary code as root by sending a crafted D-Bus message to any D-Bus system service.
