FreeIPA 4.0.x before 4.0.5 and 4.1.x before 4.1.1, when 2FA is enabled, allows remote attackers to bypass the password requirement of the two-factor authentication leveraging an enabled OTP token, which triggers an anonymous bind.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
