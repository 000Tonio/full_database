# CVE-2014-8414

- Published: 2014-11-24T15:59:00

- Modified: 2014-12-30T21:18:00

ConfBridge in Asterisk 11.x before 11.14.1 and Certified Asterisk 11.6 before 11.6-cert8 does not properly handle state changes, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (channel hang and memory consumption) by causing transitions to be delayed, which triggers a state change from hung up to waiting for media.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
