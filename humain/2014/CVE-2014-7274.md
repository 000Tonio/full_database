- Published: 2014-10-08T01:55:00

- Modified: 2014-12-22T04:09:00

The IMAP-over-SSL implementation in getmail 4.44.0 does not verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof IMAP servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate from a recognized Certification Authority.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
