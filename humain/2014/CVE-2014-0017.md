# CVE-2014-0017

- Published: 2014-03-14T15:55:00

- Modified: 2014-03-26T04:55:00

The RAND_bytes function in libssh before 0.6.3, when forking is enabled, does not properly reset the state of the OpenSSL pseudo-random number generator (PRNG), which causes the state to be shared between children processes and allows local users to obtain sensitive information by leveraging a pid collision.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
