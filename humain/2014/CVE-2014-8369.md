# CVE-2014-8369

- Published: 2014-11-10T11:55:00

- Modified: 2020-08-13T19:37:00

The kvm_iommu_map_pages function in virt/kvm/iommu.c in the Linux kernel through 3.17.2 miscalculates the number of pages during the handling of a mapping failure, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS page unpinning) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging guest OS privileges.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2014-3601.
