Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the Our Team Showcase (our-team-enhanced) plugin before 1.3 for WordPress allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) change plugin settings via unspecified vectors or (2) conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via the sc_our_team_member_count parameter in the sc_team_settings page to wp-admin/edit.php.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
