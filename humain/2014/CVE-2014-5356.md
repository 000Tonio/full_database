- Published: 2014-08-25T14:55:00

OpenStack Image Registry and Delivery Service (Glance) before 2013.2.4, 2014.x before 2014.1.3, and Juno before Juno-3, when using the V2 API, does not properly enforce the image_size_cap configuration option, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (disk consumption) by uploading a large image.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
