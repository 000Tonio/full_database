# CVE-2014-0155

- Published: 2014-04-14T23:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:34:00

The ioapic_deliver function in virt/kvm/ioapic.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.1 does not properly validate the kvm_irq_delivery_to_apic return value, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) via a crafted entry in the redirection table of an I/O APIC. NOTE: the affected code was moved to the ioapic_service function before the vulnerability was announced.
