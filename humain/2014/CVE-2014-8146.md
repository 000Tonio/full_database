- Published: 2015-05-25T22:59:00

- Modified: 2019-04-23T19:29:00

The resolveImplicitLevels function in common/ubidi.c in the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm implementation in ICU4C in International Components for Unicode (ICU) before 55.1 does not properly track directionally isolated pieces of text, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted text.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
