# CVE-2014-5253

- Published: 2014-08-25T14:55:00

- Modified: 2014-10-10T05:23:00

OpenStack Identity (Keystone) 2014.1.x before 2014.1.2.1 and Juno before Juno-3 does not properly revoke tokens when a domain is invalidated, which allows remote authenticated users to retain access via a domain-scoped token for that domain.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
