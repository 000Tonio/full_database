The woff_open_font function in sfnt/sfobjs.c in FreeType before 2.5.4 proceeds with offset+length calculations without restricting length values, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted Web Open Font Format (WOFF) file.
