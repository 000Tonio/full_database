# CVE-2014-2532

- Published: 2014-03-18T05:18:00

- Modified: 2018-07-19T01:29:00

sshd in OpenSSH before 6.6 does not properly support wildcards on AcceptEnv lines in sshd_config, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended environment restrictions by using a substring located before a wildcard character.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
