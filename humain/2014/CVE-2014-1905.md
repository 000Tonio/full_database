Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in ls/vw_snapshots.php in the VideoWhisper Live Streaming Integration plugin before 4.29.5 for WordPress allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a file with a double extension, and then accessing the file via a direct request to a wp-content/plugins/videowhisper-live-streaming-integration/ls/snapshots/ pathname, as demonstrated by a .php.jpg filename.
