# CVE-2014-3601

- Published: 2014-09-01T01:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:40:00

The kvm_iommu_map_pages function in virt/kvm/iommu.c in the Linux kernel through 3.16.1 miscalculates the number of pages during the handling of a mapping failure, which allows guest OS users to (1) cause a denial of service (host OS memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by triggering a large gfn value or (2) cause a denial of service (host OS memory consumption) by triggering a small gfn value that leads to permanently pinned pages.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
