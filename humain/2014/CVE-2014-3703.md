OpenStack PackStack 2012.2.1, when the Open vSwitch (OVS) monolithic plug-in is not used, does not properly set the libvirt_vif_driver configuration option when generating the nova.conf configuration, which causes the firewall to be disabled and allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.

### CVSS Score: **5**
