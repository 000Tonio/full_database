CFNetwork in Apple iOS before 8.1.1 and OS X before 10.10.1 does not properly clear the browsing cache upon a transition out of private-browsing mode, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading cache files. Per an <a href="http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204245">Apple Security Advisory</a> Apple iOS before 8.3.1 was also vulnerable.
Per an <a href="http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204244">Apple Security Advisory</a> Apple OS X before versions 10.8.5, 10.9.5, 10.10 and 10.10.1 were also vulnerable.
