The addAccount method in src/com/android/settings/accounts/AddAccountSettings.java in the Settings application in Android before 5.0.0 does not properly create a PendingIntent, which allows attackers to use the SYSTEM uid for broadcasting an intent with arbitrary component, action, or category information via a third-party authenticator in a crafted application, aka Bug 17356824.
