Heap-based buffer overflow in the ReadDIB function in the Vcl.Graphics.TPicture.Bitmap implementation in the Visual Component Library (VCL) in Embarcadero Delphi XE6 20.0.15596.9843 and C++ Builder XE6 20.0.15596.9843 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via the BITMAPINFOHEADER.biClrUsed field in a BMP file.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-0993.
