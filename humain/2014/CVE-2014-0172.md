Integer overflow in the check_section function in dwarf_begin_elf.c in the libdw library, as used in elfutils 0.153 and possibly through 0.158 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a malformed compressed debug section in an ELF file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.
