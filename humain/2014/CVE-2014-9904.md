# CVE-2014-9904

- Published: 2016-06-27T10:59:00

- Modified: 2023-01-17T21:42:00

The snd_compress_check_input function in sound/core/compress_offload.c in the ALSA subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.17 does not properly check for an integer overflow, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (insufficient memory allocation) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted SNDRV_COMPRESS_SET_PARAMS ioctl call.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
