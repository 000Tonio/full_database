EMC Documentum Content Server before 6.7 SP1 P28, 6.7 SP2 before P15, 7.0 before P15, and 7.1 before P06 does not properly check authorization and does not properly restrict object types, which allows remote authenticated users to run save RPC commands with super-user privileges, and consequently execute arbitrary code, via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **8.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | PARTIAL |
