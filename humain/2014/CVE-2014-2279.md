Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in SeedDMS (formerly LetoDMS and MyDMS) before 4.3.4 allow (1) remote authenticated users with access to the LogManagement functionality to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in the logname parameter to out/out.LogManagement.php or (2) remote attackers to write to arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in the fileId parameter to op/op.AddFile2.php.  NOTE: vector 2 can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code by using CVE-2014-2278.
