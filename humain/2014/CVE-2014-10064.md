# CVE-2014-10064

- Published: 2018-05-31T20:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-09T23:09:00

The qs module before 1.0.0 does not have an option or default for specifying object depth and when parsing a string representing a deeply nested object will block the event loop for long periods of time. An attacker could leverage this to cause a temporary denial-of-service condition, for example, in a web application, other requests would not be processed while this blocking is occurring.

### CVSS Score: **5**
