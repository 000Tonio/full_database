# CVE-2014-4330

- Published: 2014-09-30T16:55:00

- Modified: 2018-10-09T19:49:00

The Dumper method in Data::Dumper before 2.154, as used in Perl 5.20.1 and earlier, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (stack consumption and crash) via an Array-Reference with many nested Array-References, which triggers a large number of recursive calls to the DD_dump function.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |
