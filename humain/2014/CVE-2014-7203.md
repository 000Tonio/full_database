libzmq (aka ZeroMQ/C++) 4.0.x before 4.0.5 does not ensure that nonces are unique, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to conduct replay attacks via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
