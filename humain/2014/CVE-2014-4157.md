# CVE-2014-4157

- Published: 2014-06-23T11:21:00

- Modified: 2018-12-18T14:36:00

arch/mips/include/asm/thread_info.h in the Linux kernel before 3.14.8 on the MIPS platform does not configure _TIF_SECCOMP checks on the fast system-call path, which allows local users to bypass intended PR_SET_SECCOMP restrictions by executing a crafted application without invoking a trace or audit subsystem.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
