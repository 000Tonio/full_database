IBM CICS Transaction Server 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2, and 5.1 on z/OS does not properly implement CEMT transactions, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (storage overlay) by using a 3270 emulator to send an invalid 3270 data stream.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
