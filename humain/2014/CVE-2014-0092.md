# CVE-2014-0092

- Published: 2014-03-07T00:10:00

- Modified: 2016-11-28T19:10:00

lib/x509/verify.c in GnuTLS before 3.1.22 and 3.2.x before 3.2.12 does not properly handle unspecified errors when verifying X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers via a crafted certificate.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
