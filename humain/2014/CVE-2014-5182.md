Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the yawpp plugin 1.2 for WordPress allow remote authenticated users with Contributor privileges to execute arbitrary SQL commands via vectors related to (1) admin_functions.php or (2) admin_update.php, as demonstrated by the id parameter in the update action to wp-admin/admin.php.
