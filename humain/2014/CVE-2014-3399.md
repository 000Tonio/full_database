The SSL VPN implementation in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software 9.2(.2.4) and earlier does not properly manage session information during creation of a SharePoint handler, which allows remote authenticated users to overwrite arbitrary RAMFS cache files or inject Lua programs, and consequently cause a denial of service (portal outage or system reload), via crafted HTTP requests, aka Bug ID CSCup54208.
