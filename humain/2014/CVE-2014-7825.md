# CVE-2014-7825

- Published: 2014-11-10T11:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:42:00

kernel/trace/trace_syscalls.c in the Linux kernel through 3.17.2 does not properly handle private syscall numbers during use of the perf subsystem, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and OOPS) or bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via a crafted application.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
