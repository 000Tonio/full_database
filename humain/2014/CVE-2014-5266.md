The Incutio XML-RPC (IXR) Library, as used in WordPress before 3.9.2 and Drupal 6.x before 6.33 and 7.x before 7.31, does not limit the number of elements in an XML document, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a large document, a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-5265.
