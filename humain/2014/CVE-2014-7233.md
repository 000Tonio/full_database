# CVE-2014-7233

- Published: 2015-08-04T14:59:00

- Modified: 2018-03-28T01:29:00

GE Healthcare Precision THUNIS-800+ has a default password of (1) 1973 for the factory default System Utilities menu, (2) TH8740 for installation using TH8740_122_Setup.exe, (3) hrml for "Setup and Activation" using DSASetup, and (4) an empty string for Shutter Configuration, which has unspecified impact and attack vectors.  NOTE: since these passwords appear to be used to access functionality during installation, this issue might not cross privilege boundaries and might not be a vulnerability.

### CVSS Score: **10**
