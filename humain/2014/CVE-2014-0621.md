Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in Technicolor (formerly Thomson) TC7200 STD6.01.12 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) perform a factory reset via a request to goform/system/factory, (2) disable advanced options via a request to goform/advanced/options, (3) remove ip-filters via the IpFilterAddressDelete1 parameter to goform/advanced/ip-filters, or (4) remove firewall settings via the cbFirewall parameter to goform/advanced/firewall.
