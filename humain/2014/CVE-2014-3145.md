# CVE-2014-3145

- Published: 2014-05-11T21:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:39:00

The BPF_S_ANC_NLATTR_NEST extension implementation in the sk_run_filter function in net/core/filter.c in the Linux kernel through 3.14.3 uses the reverse order in a certain subtraction, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (over-read and system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. NOTE: the affected code was moved to the __skb_get_nlattr_nest function before the vulnerability was announced.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**
