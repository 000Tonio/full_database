# CVE-2014-3088

- Published: 2014-07-01T20:55:00

stconf.nsf in IBM Sametime Meeting Server 8.5.1 relies on the client to validate the file format used in wAttach?OpenForm multipart/form-data POST requests, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended upload restrictions by modifying the Content-Type header and file extension, as demonstrated by replacing a text/plain .txt upload with an application/octet-stream .exe upload.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
