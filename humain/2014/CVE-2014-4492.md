# CVE-2014-4492

- Published: 2015-01-30T11:59:00

- Modified: 2019-03-08T16:06:00

libnetcore in Apple iOS before 8.1.3, Apple OS X before 10.10.2, and Apple TV before 7.0.3 does not verify that certain values have the expected data type, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in an _networkd context via a crafted XPC message from a sandboxed app, as demonstrated by lack of verification of the XPC dictionary data type.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
