- Modified: 2017-12-16T02:29:00

cURL and libcurl 7.1 before 7.36.0, when using the OpenSSL, axtls, qsossl or gskit libraries for TLS, recognize a wildcard IP address in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which might allow man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
