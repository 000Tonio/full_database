The chrome_pdf::CopyImage function in pdf/draw_utils.cc in the PDFium component in Google Chrome before 38.0.2125.101 does not properly validate image-data dimensions, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.
