Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in Command School Student Management System 1.06.01 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of (1) administrators for requests that change the administrator password via an update action to sw/admin_change_password.php or (2) unspecified victims for requests that add a topic or blog entry to sw/add_topic.php.  NOTE: vector 2 can be leveraged to bypass the authentication requirements for exploiting vector 1 in CVE-2014-1914.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
