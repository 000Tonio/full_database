The uv_rwlock_t fallback implementation for Windows XP and Server 2003 in libuv before 1.7.4 does not properly prevent threads from releasing the locks of other threads, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (deadlock) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging a race condition.
