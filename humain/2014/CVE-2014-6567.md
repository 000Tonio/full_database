- Published: 2015-01-21T15:28:00

Unspecified vulnerability in the Core RDBMS component in Oracle Database Server 11.1.0.7, 11.2.0.3, 11.2.0.4, 12.1.0.1, and 12.1.0.2 allows remote authenticated users to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information is from the January 2015 CPU. Oracle has not commented on the researcher's claim that this is a stack-based buffer overflow in DBMS_AW.EXECUTE, which allows code execution via a long Current Directory Alias (CDA) command. Per: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpujan2015-1972971.html

The CVSS Score is 9.0 only on Windows for Database versions prior to 12c. The CVSS Base Score is 6.5 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability are Partial+) for Database 12c on Windows and for all versions of Database on Linux, Unix and other platforms.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
