OpenStack Image Registry and Delivery Service (Glance) 2014.2 through 2014.2.2 does not properly remove images, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (disk consumption) by creating a large number of images using the task v2 API and then deleting them before the uploads finish, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-1881.

### CVSS Score: **4**
