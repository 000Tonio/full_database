The tak_decode_frame function in libavcodec/takdec.c in FFmpeg before 2.1.4 does not properly validate a certain bits-per-sample value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted TAK (aka Tom's lossless Audio Kompressor) data.
