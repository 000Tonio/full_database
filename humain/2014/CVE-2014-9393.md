Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the Post to Twitter plugin 0.7 and earlier for WordPress allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via the (1) idptt_twitter_username or (2) idptt_tweet_prefix parameter to wp-admin/options-general.php.
