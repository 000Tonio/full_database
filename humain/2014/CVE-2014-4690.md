Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in pfSense before 2.1.4 allow (1) remote attackers to read arbitrary .info files via a crafted path in the pkg parameter to pkg_mgr_install.php and allow (2) remote authenticated users to read arbitrary files via the downloadbackup parameter to system_firmware_restorefullbackup.php.

### CVSS Score: **5**
