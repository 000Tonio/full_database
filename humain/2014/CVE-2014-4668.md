# CVE-2014-4668

- Published: 2014-07-02T04:14:00

- Modified: 2017-01-03T02:59:00

The cherokee_validator_ldap_check function in validator_ldap.c in Cherokee 1.2.103 and earlier, when LDAP is used, does not properly consider unauthenticated-bind semantics, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via an empty password.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
