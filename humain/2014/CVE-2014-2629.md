HP NonStop Safeguard Security Software G, H06.03 through H06.28.01, and J06.03 through J06.17.01 does not properly evaluate the DISKFILE-PATTERN ACL of a program object file, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended restrictions on program access via vectors related to process-creation time.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
