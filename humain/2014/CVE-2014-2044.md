Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in ajax/upload.php in ownCloud before 5.0, when running on Windows, allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions, upload files with arbitrary names, and execute arbitrary code via an Alternate Data Stream (ADS) syntax in the filename parameter, as demonstrated using .htaccess::$DATA to upload a PHP program.
