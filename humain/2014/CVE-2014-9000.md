# CVE-2014-9000

- Published: 2014-11-20T13:55:00

- Modified: 2014-11-20T15:00:00

Mule Enterprise Management Console (MMC) does not properly restrict access to handler/securityService.rpc, which allows remote authenticated users to gain administrator privileges and execute arbitrary code via a crafted request that adds a new user.  NOTE: this issue was originally reported for ESB Runtime 3.5.1, but it originates in MMC.
