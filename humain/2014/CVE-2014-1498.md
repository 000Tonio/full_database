- Published: 2014-03-19T10:55:00

- Modified: 2020-08-14T17:40:00

The crypto.generateCRMFRequest method in Mozilla Firefox before 28.0 and SeaMonkey before 2.25 does not properly validate a certain key type, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via vectors that trigger generation of a key that supports the Elliptic Curve ec-dual-use algorithm.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
