# CVE-2014-5117

- Published: 2014-07-30T16:55:00

- Modified: 2017-01-07T03:00:00

Tor before 0.2.4.23 and 0.2.5 before 0.2.5.6-alpha maintains a circuit after an inbound RELAY_EARLY cell is received by a client, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct traffic-confirmation attacks by using the pattern of RELAY and RELAY_EARLY cells as a means of communicating information about hidden service names.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
