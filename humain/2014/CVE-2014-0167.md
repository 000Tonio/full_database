The Nova EC2 API security group implementation in OpenStack Compute (Nova) 2013.1 before 2013.2.4 and icehouse before icehouse-rc2 does not enforce RBAC policies for (1) add_rules, (2) remove_rules, (3) destroy, and other unspecified methods in compute/api.py when using non-default policies, which allows remote authenticated users to gain privileges via these API requests.
