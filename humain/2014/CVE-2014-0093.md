Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (JBEAP) 6.2.2, when using a Java Security Manager (JSM), does not properly apply permissions defined by a policy file, which causes applications to be granted the java.security.AllPermission permission and allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| --- | --- | --- |
