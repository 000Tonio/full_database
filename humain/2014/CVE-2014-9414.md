# CVE-2014-9414

- Published: 2014-12-24T18:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-09T19:55:00

The W3 Total Cache plugin before 0.9.4.1 for WordPress does not properly handle empty nonces, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks and hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that change the mobile site redirect URI via the mobile_groups[*][redirect] parameter and an empty _wpnonce parameter in the w3tc_mobile page to wp-admin/admin.php.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
