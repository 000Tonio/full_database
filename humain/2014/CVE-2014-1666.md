The do_physdev_op function in Xen 4.1.5, 4.1.6.1, 4.2.2 through 4.2.3, and 4.3.x does not properly restrict access to the (1) PHYSDEVOP_prepare_msix and (2) PHYSDEVOP_release_msix operations, which allows local PV guests to cause a denial of service (host or guest malfunction) or possibly gain privileges via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **8.3**
