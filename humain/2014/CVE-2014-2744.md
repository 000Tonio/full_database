# CVE-2014-2744

- Published: 2014-04-11T01:55:00

- Modified: 2014-04-19T04:48:00

plugins/mod_compression.lua in (1) Prosody before 0.9.4 and (2) Lightwitch Metronome through 3.4 negotiates stream compression while a session is unauthenticated, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via compressed XML elements in an XMPP stream, aka an "xmppbomb" attack.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
