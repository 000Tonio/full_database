MantisBT before 1.2.18 allows remote authenticated users to bypass the $g_download_attachments_threshold and $g_view_attachments_threshold restrictions and read attachments for private projects by leveraging access to a project that does not restrict access to attachments and a request to the download URL.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
