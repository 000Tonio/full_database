# CVE-2014-8481

- Published: 2014-11-10T11:55:00

- Modified: 2015-11-20T16:08:00

The instruction decoder in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM subsystem in the Linux kernel before 3.18-rc2 does not properly handle invalid instructions, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and host OS crash) via a crafted application that triggers (1) an improperly fetched instruction or (2) an instruction that occupies too many bytes.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-8480.
