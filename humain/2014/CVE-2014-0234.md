The default configuration of broker.conf in Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 2.x before 2.1 has a password of "mooo" for a Mongo account, which allows remote attackers to hijack the broker by providing this password, related to the openshift.sh script in Openshift Extras before 20130920. NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2013-4253 and CVE-2013-4281.
