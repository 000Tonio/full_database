Apache Cordova 3.3.0 and earlier and Adobe PhoneGap 2.9.0 and earlier on Windows Phone 7 and 8 do not properly restrict navigation events, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended device-resource restrictions via content that is accessed (1) in an IFRAME element or (2) with the XMLHttpRequest method by a crafted application.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
