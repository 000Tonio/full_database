com/salesmanager/central/profile/ProfileAction.java in Shopizer 1.1.5 and earlier does not restrict the number of authentication attempts, which makes it easier for remote attackers to guess passwords via a brute force attack.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
