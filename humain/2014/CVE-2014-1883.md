Adobe PhoneGap before 2.6.0 on Android uses the shouldOverrideUrlLoading callback instead of the proper shouldInterceptRequest callback, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended device-resource restrictions via content that is accessed (1) in an IFRAME element or (2) with the XMLHttpRequest method by a crafted application.
