The IBM Notes Traveler application before 9.0.1.3 for Android lacks a warning message during selection of an HTTP session, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network during a session in which the user had intended to use HTTPS.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
