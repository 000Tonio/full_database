- Published: 2014-06-18T16:55:00

The dissect_frame function in epan/dissectors/packet-frame.c in the frame metadissector in Wireshark 1.10.x before 1.10.8 interprets a negative integer as a length value even though it was intended to represent an error condition, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet.
