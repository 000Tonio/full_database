# CVE-2014-3608

- Published: 2014-10-06T14:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:41:00

The VMWare driver in OpenStack Compute (Nova) before 2014.1.3 allows remote authenticated users to bypass the quota limit and cause a denial of service (resource consumption) by putting the VM into the rescue state, suspending it, which puts into an ERROR state, and then deleting the image. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-2573.
