# CVE-2014-0053

- Published: 2014-04-15T23:55:00

- Modified: 2018-10-09T19:35:00

The default configuration of the Resources plugin 1.0.0 before 1.2.6 for Pivotal Grails 2.0.0 before 2.3.6 does not properly restrict access to files in the WEB-INF directory, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a direct request.  NOTE: this identifier has been SPLIT due to different researchers and different vulnerability types. See CVE-2014-2857 for the META-INF variant and CVE-2014-2858 for the directory traversal.
