The Services module 7.x-3.x before 7.x-3.10 for Drupal does not properly limit the rate of authentication attempts, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access via a brute-force attack on the administrative password.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
