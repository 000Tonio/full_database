The x86_emulate function in arch/x86/x86_emulate/x86_emulate.c in Xen 3.3.x through 4.4.x does not check the supervisor mode permissions for instructions that generate software interrupts, which allows local HVM guest users to cause a denial of service (guest crash) via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **3.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
