Mozilla Firefox before 30.0 and Thunderbird through 24.6 on OS X do not ensure visibility of the cursor after interaction with a Flash object and a DIV element, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct clickjacking attacks via JavaScript code that produces a fake cursor image.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
