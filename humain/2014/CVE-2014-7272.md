# CVE-2014-7272

- Published: 2018-03-08T20:29:00

- Modified: 2018-03-27T23:50:00

Simple Desktop Display Manager (SDDM) before 0.10.0 allows local users to gain root privileges because code running as root performs write operations within a user home directory, and this user may have created links in advance (exploitation requires the user to win a race condition in the ~/.Xauthority chown case, but not other cases).

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
