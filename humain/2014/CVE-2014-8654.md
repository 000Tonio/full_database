Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in Compal Broadband Networks (CBN) CH6640E and CG6640E Wireless Gateway hardware 1.0 with firmware CH6640-3.5.11.7-NOSH allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) have unspecified impact on DDNS configuration via a request to basicDDNS.html, (2) change the wifi password via the psKey parameter to setWirelessSecurity.html, (3) add a static MAC address via the MacAddress parameter in an add_static action to setBasicDHCP1.html, or (4) enable or disable UPnP via the UPnP parameter in an apply action to setAdvancedOptions.html.
