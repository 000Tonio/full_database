# CVE-2014-9912

- Published: 2017-01-04T20:59:00

- Modified: 2017-01-07T03:00:00

The get_icu_disp_value_src_php function in ext/intl/locale/locale_methods.c in PHP before 5.3.29, 5.4.x before 5.4.30, and 5.5.x before 5.5.14 does not properly restrict calls to the ICU uresbund.cpp component, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a locale_get_display_name call with a long first argument.
