- Published: 2018-01-08T19:29:00

- Modified: 2018-01-31T15:23:00

DefaultHostnameVerifier in Ldaptive (formerly vt-ldap) does not properly verify that the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via an arbitrary valid certificate.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
