The Ubercart module 7.x-3.x before 7.x-3.7 for Drupal does not properly protect the per-user order history view, which allows remote authenticated users with the "view own orders" permission to obtain sensitive information via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
