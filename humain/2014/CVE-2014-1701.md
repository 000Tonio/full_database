The GenerateFunction function in bindings/scripts/code_generator_v8.pm in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 33.0.1750.149, does not implement a certain cross-origin restriction for the EventTarget::dispatchEvent function, which allows remote attackers to conduct Universal XSS (UXSS) attacks via vectors involving events.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
