RSA Adaptive Authentication (On-Premise) 6.0.2.1 through 7.1 P3, when using device binding in a Challenge SOAP call or using the RSA Adaptive Authentication Integration Adapters with Out-of-Band Phone (Authentify) functionality, conducts permanent device binding even when authentication fails, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication.

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
