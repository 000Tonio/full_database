# CVE-2014-9426

- Published: 2014-12-31T02:59:00

- Modified: 2015-03-17T02:01:00

** DISPUTED ** The apprentice_load function in libmagic/apprentice.c in the Fileinfo component in PHP through 5.6.4 attempts to perform a free operation on a stack-based character array, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.  NOTE: this is disputed by the vendor because the standard erealloc behavior makes the free operation unreachable.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
