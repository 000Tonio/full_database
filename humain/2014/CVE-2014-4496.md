- Modified: 2019-03-08T16:06:00

The mach_port_kobject interface in the kernel in Apple iOS before 8.1.3 and Apple TV before 7.0.3 does not properly restrict kernel-address and heap-permutation information, which makes it easier for attackers to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via a crafted app.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
