Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in D-Link DAP-1360 router with firmware 2.5.4 and earlier allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of unspecified users for requests that (1) change the MAC filter restrict mode, (2) add a MAC address to the filter, or (3) remove a MAC address from the filter via a crafted request to index.cgi.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
