# CVE-2014-9689

- Published: 2015-03-09T00:59:00

content/renderer/device_sensors/device_orientation_event_pump.cc in Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76 does not properly restrict access to high-rate gyroscope data, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain speech signals from a device's physical environment via a crafted web site that listens for ondeviceorientation events, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-1231.

### CVSS Score: **5**
