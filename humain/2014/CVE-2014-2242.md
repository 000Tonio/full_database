# CVE-2014-2242

- Published: 2014-03-02T04:57:00

includes/upload/UploadBase.php in MediaWiki before 1.19.12, 1.20.x and 1.21.x before 1.21.6, and 1.22.x before 1.22.3 does not prevent use of invalid namespaces in SVG files, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via an SVG upload, as demonstrated by use of a W3C XHTML namespace in conjunction with an IFRAME element.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
