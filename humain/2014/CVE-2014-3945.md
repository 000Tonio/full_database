- Published: 2014-06-03T14:55:00

- Modified: 2014-06-04T15:24:00

The Authentication component in TYPO3 before 6.2, when salting for password hashing is disabled, does not require knowledge of the cleartext password if the password hash is known, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and gain access to the backend by leveraging knowledge of a password hash.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
