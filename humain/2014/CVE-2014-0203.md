- Published: 2014-06-23T11:21:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:37:00

The __do_follow_link function in fs/namei.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.33 does not properly handle the last pathname component during use of certain filesystems, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (incorrect free operations and system crash) via an open system call.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
