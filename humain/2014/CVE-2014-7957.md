Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the Pods plugin before 2.5 for WordPress allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via the toggled parameter in a toggle action in the pods-components page to wp-admin/admin.php, (2) delete a pod in a delete action in the pods page to wp-admin/admin.php, (3) reset pod settings and data via the pods_reset parameter in the pod-settings page to wp-admin/admin.php, (4) deactivate and reset pod data via the pods_reset_deactivate parameter in the pod-settings page to wp-admin/admin.php, (5) delete the admin role via the id parameter in a delete action in the pods-component-roles-and-capabilities page to wp-admin/admin.php, or (6) enable "roles and capabilities" in a toggle action in the pods-components page to wp-admin/admin.php.
