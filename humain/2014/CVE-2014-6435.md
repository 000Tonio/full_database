cgi-bin/AZ_Retrain.cgi in Aztech ADSL DSL5018EN (1T1R), DSL705E, and DSL705EU devices does not check for authentication, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (WAN connectivity reset) via a direct request.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
