# CVE-2014-7835

- Published: 2014-11-24T11:59:00

- Modified: 2020-12-01T14:54:00

webservice/upload.php in Moodle 2.6.x before 2.6.6 and 2.7.x before 2.7.3 does not ensure that a file upload is for a private or draft area, which allows remote authenticated users to upload files containing JavaScript, and consequently conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, by specifying the profile-picture area.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
