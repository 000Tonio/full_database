# CVE-2014-2243

- Published: 2014-03-02T04:57:00

includes/User.php in MediaWiki before 1.19.12, 1.20.x and 1.21.x before 1.21.6, and 1.22.x before 1.22.3 terminates validation of a user token upon encountering the first incorrect character, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access via a brute-force attack that relies on timing differences in responses to incorrect token guesses.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
