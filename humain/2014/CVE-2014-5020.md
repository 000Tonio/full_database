The File module in Drupal 7.x before 7.29 does not properly check permissions to view files, which allows remote authenticated users with certain permissions to bypass intended restrictions and read files by attaching the file to content with a file field.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
