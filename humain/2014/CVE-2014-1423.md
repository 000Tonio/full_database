signond before 8.57+15.04.20141127.1-0ubuntu1, as used in Ubuntu Touch, did not properly restrict applications from querying oath tokens due to incorrect checks and the missing installation of the signon-apparmor-extension. An attacker could use this create a malicious click app that collects oauth tokens for other applications, exposing sensitive information.
