The (1) get_quoted_string and (2) get_unquoted_string functions in epan/dissectors/packet-cups.c in the CUPS dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.1 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read and application crash) via a CUPS packet that lacks a trailing '\0' character.
