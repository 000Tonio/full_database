# CVE-2014-8640

- Published: 2015-01-14T11:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

The mozilla::dom::AudioParamTimeline::AudioNodeInputValue function in the Web Audio API implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 35.0 and SeaMonkey before 2.32 does not properly restrict timeline operations, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (uninitialized-memory read and application crash) via crafted API calls.

### CVSS Score: **5**
