The firmware before 3.66E in IBM BladeCenter Advanced Management Module (AMM), the firmware before 1.43 in IBM Integrated Management Module (IMM), and the firmware before 4.15 in IBM Integrated Management Module II (IMM2) contains cleartext IPMI credentials, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary IPMI commands, and consequently establish a blade remote-control session, by leveraging access to (1) the chassis internal network or (2) the Ethernet-over-USB interface.
