The query caching functionality in the Extbase Framework component in TYPO3 6.2.0 before 6.2.3 does not properly validate group permissions, which allows remote authenticated users to read arbitrary queries via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
