The Role Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) 6.2.0 through 6.3.2 does not properly verify authorization conditions, which allows remote authenticated users to add, modify, and undefine otherwise restricted attributes by leveraging the Maintainer role.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
