IBM Curam Social Program Management (SPM) 5.2 before SP6 EP6, 6.0 SP2 before EP26, 6.0.4 before 6.0.4.6, and 6.0.5 before 6.0.5.6 requires failed-login handling for web-service accounts to have the same lockout policy as for standard user accounts, which makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (web-service outage) by making many login attempts with a valid caseworker account name.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
