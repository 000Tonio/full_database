- Published: 2014-04-09T10:57:00

The base64DecodeInternal function in wtf/text/Base64.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 34.0.1847.116, does not properly handle string data composed exclusively of whitespace characters, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a window.atob method call.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
