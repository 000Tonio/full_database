Hospira MedNet before 6.1 uses a hardcoded cleartext password to control SQL database authorization, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging knowledge of this password. Per https://ics-cert.us-cert.gov/advisories/ICSA-15-090-03:

“The MedNet software contains plaintext storage of passwords for the SQL database that may allow an attacker to compromise the MedNet SQL server and gain administrative access to the workstation.”

Based on this information, the score has been adjusted.  For additional information or questions please contact ICS-CERT (contact information available via advisory link).
