Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in innovaphone PBX 10.00 sr11 and earlier allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that modify configurations or user accounts, as demonstrated by (1) changing the administrator password via a crafted request to CMD0/mod_cmd.xml or (2) adding a new SIP user via a crafted request to PBX0/ADMIN/mod_cmd_login.xml.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
