- Published: 2014-07-25T19:55:00

Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in Omeka before 2.2.1 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) add a new super user account via a request to admin/users/add, (2) insert cross-site scripting (XSS) sequences via the api_key_label parameter to admin/users/api-keys/1, or (3) disable file validation via a request to admin/settings/edit-security.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
