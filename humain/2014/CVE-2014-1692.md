- Published: 2014-01-29T16:02:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:38:00

The hash_buffer function in schnorr.c in OpenSSH through 6.4, when Makefile.inc is modified to enable the J-PAKE protocol, does not initialize certain data structures, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or have unspecified other impact via vectors that trigger an error condition.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
