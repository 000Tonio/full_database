Huawei Eudemon8000E firewall with software V200R001C01SPC800 and earlier versions allows users to log in to the device using Telnet or SSH. When an attacker sends to the device a mass of TCP packets with special structure, the logging process becomes slow and users may be unable to log in to the device.
