# CVE-2014-9659

- Published: 2015-02-08T11:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

cff/cf2intrp.c in the CFF CharString interpreter in FreeType before 2.5.4 proceeds with additional hints after the hint mask has been computed, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow) via a crafted OpenType font.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-2240.
