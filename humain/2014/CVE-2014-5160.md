** DISPUTED ** Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in crs.exe in the Cell Request Service in HP Data Protector allow remote attackers to create arbitrary files via an opcode-1091 request, or create or delete arbitrary files via an opcode-305 request.  NOTE: the vendor reportedly asserts that this behavior is "by design."
