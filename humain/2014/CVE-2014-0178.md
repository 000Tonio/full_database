# CVE-2014-0178

- Published: 2014-05-28T04:58:00

- Modified: 2022-09-01T16:34:00

Samba 3.6.6 through 3.6.23, 4.0.x before 4.0.18, and 4.1.x before 4.1.8, when a certain vfs shadow copy configuration is enabled, does not properly initialize the SRV_SNAPSHOT_ARRAY response field, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain potentially sensitive information from process memory via a (1) FSCTL_GET_SHADOW_COPY_DATA or (2) FSCTL_SRV_ENUMERATE_SNAPSHOTS request.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
