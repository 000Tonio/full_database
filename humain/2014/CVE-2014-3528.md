# CVE-2014-3528

- Published: 2014-08-19T18:55:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

Apache Subversion 1.0.0 through 1.7.x before 1.7.17 and 1.8.x before 1.8.10 uses an MD5 hash of the URL and authentication realm to store cached credentials, which makes it easier for remote servers to obtain the credentials via a crafted authentication realm.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
