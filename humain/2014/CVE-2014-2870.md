The default configuration of PaperThin CommonSpot before 7.0.2 and 8.x before 8.0.3 uses cleartext for storage of credentials in a database, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
