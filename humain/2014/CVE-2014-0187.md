# CVE-2014-0187

- Published: 2014-04-28T14:09:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

The openvswitch-agent process in OpenStack Neutron 2013.1 before 2013.2.4 and 2014.1 before 2014.1.1 allows remote authenticated users to bypass security group restrictions via an invalid CIDR in a security group rule, which prevents further rules from being applied.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
