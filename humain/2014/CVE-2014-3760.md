Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in D-Link DAP 1150 with firmware 1.2.94 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) enable or (2) disable the DMZ in the Firewall/DMZ section via a request to index.cgi or (3) add, (4) modify, or (5) delete URL-filter settings in the Control/URL-filter section via a request to index.cgi, as demonstrated by adding a rule that blocks access to google.com.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
