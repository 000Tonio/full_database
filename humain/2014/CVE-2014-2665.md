# CVE-2014-2665

- Published: 2014-04-20T01:55:00

- Modified: 2014-04-24T05:06:00

includes/specials/SpecialChangePassword.php in MediaWiki before 1.19.14, 1.20.x and 1.21.x before 1.21.8, and 1.22.x before 1.22.5 does not properly handle a correctly authenticated but unintended login attempt, which makes it easier for remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information by arranging for a victim to login to the attacker's account, as demonstrated by tracking the victim's activity, related to a "login CSRF" issue.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
