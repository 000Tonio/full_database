The do_mmu_update function in arch/x86/mm.c in Xen 4.x through 4.4.x does not properly restrict updates to only PV page tables, which allows remote PV guests to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) by leveraging hardware emulation services for HVM guests using Hardware Assisted Paging (HAP).
