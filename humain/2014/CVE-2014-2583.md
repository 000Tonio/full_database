Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in pam_timestamp.c in the pam_timestamp module for Linux-PAM (aka pam) 1.1.8 allow local users to create arbitrary files or possibly bypass authentication via a .. (dot dot) in the (1) PAM_RUSER value to the get_ruser function or (2) PAM_TTY value to the check_tty function, which is used by the format_timestamp_name function.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
