The kernel in Apple iOS before 8.1.1 and Apple TV before 7.0.2 does not properly validate IOSharedDataQueue object metadata, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in a privileged context via a crafted application. Per an <a href="http://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204244">Apple Security Advisory</a> Apple OS X before versions 10.8.6, 10.9.6, 10.10.0 and 10.10.1 were also vulnerable.
