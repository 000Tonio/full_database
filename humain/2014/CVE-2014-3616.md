nginx 0.5.6 through 1.7.4, when using the same shared ssl_session_cache or ssl_session_ticket_key for multiple servers, can reuse a cached SSL session for an unrelated context, which allows remote attackers with certain privileges to conduct "virtual host confusion" attacks.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
