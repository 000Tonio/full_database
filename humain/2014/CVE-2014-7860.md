The web/web_file/fb_publish.php script in D-Link DNS-320L before 1.04b12 and DNS-327L before 1.03b04 Build0119 does not authenticate requests, which allows remote attackers to obtain arbitrary photos and publish them to an arbitrary Facebook profile via a target album_id and access_token.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
