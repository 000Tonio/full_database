views/Index.php in the Install module in vTiger 6.0 before Security Patch 2 does not properly restrict access, which allows remote attackers to re-install the application via a request that sets the X-Requested-With HTTP header, as demonstrated by executing arbitrary PHP code via the db_name parameter.

### CVSS Score: **5**
