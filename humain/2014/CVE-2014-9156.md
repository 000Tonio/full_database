The FileField module 6.x-3.x before 6.x-3.13 for Drupal does not properly check permissions to view files, which allows remote authenticated users with permission to create or edit content to read private files by attaching an uploaded file.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
