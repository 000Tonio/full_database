IBM Notes and Domino 8.5.x before 8.5.3 FP6 IF3 and 9.x before 9.0.1 FP1 on 32-bit Linux platforms use incorrect gcc options, which makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by leveraging the absence of the NX protection mechanism and placing crafted x86 code on the stack, aka SPR KLYH9GGS9W.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
