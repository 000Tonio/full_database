# CVE-2006-0805

- Published: 2006-02-21T02:02:00

The CAPTCHA functionality in php-Nuke 6.0 through 7.9 uses fixed challenge/response pairs that only vary once per day based on the User Agent (HTTP_USER_AGENT), which allows remote attackers to bypass CAPTCHA controls by fixing the User Agent, performing a valid challenge/response, then replaying that pair in the random_num and gfx_check parameters.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
