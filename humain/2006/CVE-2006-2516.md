# CVE-2006-2516

- Published: 2006-05-22T22:02:00

mainfile.php in XOOPS 2.0.13.2 and earlier, when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to overwrite variables such as $xoopsOption['nocommon'] and conduct directory traversal attacks or include PHP files via (1) xoopsConfig[language] to misc.php or (2) xoopsConfig[theme_set] to index.php, as demonstrated by injecting PHP sequences into a log file. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled, and that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.
