Windows Firewall in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 produces incorrect application block alerts when the application filename is ".exe" (with no characters before the "."), which might allow local user-assisted users to trick a user into unblocking a Trojan horse program, as demonstrated by a malicious ".exe" program in a folder named "Internet Explorer," which triggers a question about whether to unblock the "Internet Explorer" program.
