new_ticket.cgi in Hostflow 2.2.1-15 allows remote attackers to steal and replay authentication credentials via an IMG tag in the desc parameter ("Ticket Description" field) that points to a URL that captures referer URLs, possibly due to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability or a leak of credentials in referer URLs.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
