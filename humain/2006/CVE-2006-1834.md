- Published: 2006-04-19T16:06:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:36:00

Integer signedness error in Opera before 8.54 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via long values in a stylesheet attribute, which pass a length check.  NOTE: a sign extension problem makes the attack easier with shorter strings.
