** DISPUTED ** The Task scheduler (at.exe) on Microsoft Windows XP spawns each scheduled process with SYSTEM permissions, which allows local users to gain privileges.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by third parties, who state that the Task scheduler is limited to the Administrators group by default upon installation.
