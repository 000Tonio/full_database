# CVE-2006-2734

- Published: 2006-06-01T10:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:41:00

enter.asp in Mini-Nuke 2.3 and earlier makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct password guessing attacks by setting the guvenlik parameter to the same value as the hidden gguvenlik parameter, which bypasses a verification step because the gguvenlik parameter is assumed to be immutable by the attacker.

### CVSS Score: **5**
