Cisco NAC maintains an exception list that does not record device properties other than MAC address, which allows physically proximate attackers to bypass control methods and join a local network by spoofing the MAC address of a different type of device, as demonstrated by using the MAC address of a disconnected printer.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
