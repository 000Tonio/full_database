An unspecified "logical programming mistake" in SMART SynchronEyes Student and Teacher 6.0, and possibly earlier versions, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a large packet to the Teacher discovery port (UDP port 5496), which causes a thread to terminate and prevents communications on that port.
