Buffer overflow in eStara Softphone 3.0.1.14 through 3.0.1.46 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long attribute (aka "a") field in the SDP data of a SIP packet on UDP port 5060. This is the vendor provided solution:

"eStara has released Softphone version 3.0.1.47 to resolve the buffer overflow demonstrated in parsing SDP with long "a=" lines.  Licensed customers can download a new version via the email sent to them with purchase, customers testing may go back to http://www.estara.com/softphone/ to obtain a new free trial.   Version information can be gathered by going to Help->About.  eStara highly recommends all customers upgrade to avoid this issue.  If there's further questions please email us: softphone@estara.com.
 
eStara would like to thank ZwelL for bringing the issue to our attention."
