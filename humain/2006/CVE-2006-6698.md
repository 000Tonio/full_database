# CVE-2006-6698

- Published: 2006-12-22T18:28:00

- Modified: 2011-03-08T02:46:00

The GConf daemon (gconfd) in GConf 2.14.0 creates temporary files under directories with names based on the username, even when GCONF_GLOBAL_LOCKS is not set, which allows local users to cause a denial of service by creating the directories ahead of time, which prevents other users from using Gnome.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
