LightTPD 1.4.8 and earlier, when the web root is on a case-insensitive filesystem, allows remote attackers to bypass URL checks and obtain sensitive information via file extensions with unexpected capitalization, as demonstrated by a request for index.PHP when the configuration invokes the PHP interpreter only for ".php" names.
