# CVE-2006-1147

- Published: 2006-03-10T11:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:30:00

The Com_sprintf function in q_shared.c in Alien Arena 2006 Gold Edition 5.00 does not properly NULL terminate certain long strings, which allows remote attackers (possibly authenticated) to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a long skin, weapon, or model name.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
