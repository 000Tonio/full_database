Microsoft ASP .NET Framework 2.0.50727.42 does not properly handle comment (/* */) enclosures, which allows remote attackers to bypass request filtering and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or cause a denial of service, as demonstrated via an xss:expression STYLE attribute in a closing XSS HTML tag.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
