# CVE-2006-6071

- Published: 2006-12-02T02:28:00

- Modified: 2017-07-20T01:34:00

TWiki 4.0.5 and earlier, when running under Apache 1.3 using ApacheLogin with sessions and "ErrorDocument 401" redirects to a valid wiki topic, does not properly handle failed login attempts, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary content by cancelling out of a failed authentication with a valid username and invalid password.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
