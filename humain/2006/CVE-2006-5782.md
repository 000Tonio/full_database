radexecd.exe in HP OpenView Client Configuraton Manager (CCM) does not require authentication before executing commands in the installation directory, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (reboot) by calling radbootw.exe or create arbitrary files by calling radcrecv.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
