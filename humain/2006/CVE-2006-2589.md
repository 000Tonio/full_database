SQL injection vulnerability in rss.php in MyBB (aka MyBulletinBoard) 1.1.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the comma parameter.  NOTE: it is not clear from the original report how this attack can succeed, since the demonstration URL uses a variable that is overwritten with static data in the extracted source code.
