** DISPUTED **  Integer overflow in banner/banner.c in FreeBSD, NetBSD, and OpenBSD might allow local users to modify memory via a long banner.  NOTE: CVE and multiple third parties dispute this issue. Since banner is not setuid, an exploit would not cross privilege boundaries in normal operations. This issue is not a vulnerability.

### CVSS Score: **4.4**
