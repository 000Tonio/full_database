Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in search.php in My Amazon Store Manager 1.0 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the Keywords parameter.  NOTE: some sources claim that the affected parameter is "q", but the only public archive of the original researcher notification shows an XSS manipulation in "Keywords".

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
