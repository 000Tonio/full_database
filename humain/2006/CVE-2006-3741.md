The perfmonctl system call (sys_perfmonctl) in Linux kernel 2.4.x and 2.6 before 2.6.18, when running on Itanium systems, does not properly track the reference count for file descriptors, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (file descriptor consumption).

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
