- Published: 2006-09-14T22:07:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:25:00

Multiple buffer overflows in libavcodec in ffmpeg before 0.4.9_p20060530 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code via multiple unspecified vectors in (1) dtsdec.c, (2) vorbis.c, (3) rm.c, (4) sierravmd.c, (5) smacker.c, (6) tta.c, (7) 4xm.c, (8) alac.c, (9) cook.c, (10) shorten.c, (11) smacker.c, (12) snow.c, and (13) tta.c.  NOTE: it is likely that this is a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-4048 and CVE-2006-2802.
