# CVE-2006-1594

- Published: 2006-04-03T10:04:00

Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in document/rqmkhtml.php in Claroline 1.7.4 and earlier allow remote attackers to use ".." (dot dot) sequences to (1) read arbitrary files via the file parameter in a rqEditHtml command to document/rqmkhtml.php or (2) execute arbitrary code via the includePath parameter to learnPath/include/scormExport.inc.php. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
