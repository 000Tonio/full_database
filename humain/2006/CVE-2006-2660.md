Buffer consumption vulnerability in the tempnam function in PHP 5.1.4 and 4.x before 4.4.3 allows local users to bypass restrictions and create PHP files with fixed names in other directories via a pathname argument longer than MAXPATHLEN, which prevents a unique string from being appended to the filename.
