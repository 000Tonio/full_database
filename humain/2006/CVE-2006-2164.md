Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Avactis Shopping Cart 0.1.2 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) category_id parameter in (a) store_special_offers.php and (b) store.php, and (2) prod_id parameter in (c) cart.php and (d) product_info.php.  NOTE: this issue also produces resultant full path disclosure from invalid SQL queries.
