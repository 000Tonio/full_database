** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in upload.php in Rad Upload 3.02 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the save_path parameter.  NOTE: CVE disputes this vulnerability because save_path is originally defined as "" before use, and the nearby instructions say "SET THE SAVE PATH by editing the line below."
