ld in SUSE Linux 9.1 through 10.0, and SLES 9, in certain circumstances when linking binaries, can leave an empty RPATH or RUNPATH, which allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code as other users via by running an ld-linked application from the current directory, which could contain an attacker-controlled library file.
