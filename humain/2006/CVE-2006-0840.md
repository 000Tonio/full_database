# CVE-2006-0840

- Published: 2006-02-22T02:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:29:00

manage_user_page.php in Mantis 1.00rc4 and earlier does not properly handle a sort parameter containing a ' (quote) character, which allows remote attackers to trigger a SQL error that may be repeatedly reported to a user who makes subsequent web accesses with the MANTIS_MANAGE_COOKIE cookie.  NOTE: this issue might be the same as vector 2 in CVE-2005-4519.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
