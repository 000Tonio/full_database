Buffer overflow in the shared_region_make_private_np function in vm/vm_unix.c in Mac OS X 10.4.6 and earlier allows local users to execute arbitrary code via (1) a small range count, which causes insufficient memory allocation, or (2) a large number of ranges in the shared_region_make_private_np_args parameter.
