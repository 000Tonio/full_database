# CVE-2006-7098

- Published: 2007-03-03T19:19:00

- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:29:00

The Debian GNU/Linux 033_-F_NO_SETSID patch for the Apache HTTP Server 1.3.34-4 does not properly disassociate httpd from a controlling tty when httpd is started interactively, which allows local users to gain privileges to that tty via a CGI program that calls the TIOCSTI ioctl.
