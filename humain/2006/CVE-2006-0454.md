# CVE-2006-0454

- Published: 2006-02-07T18:06:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:44:00

Linux kernel before 2.6.15.3 down to 2.6.12, while constructing an ICMP response in icmp_send, does not properly handle when the ip_options_echo function in icmp.c fails, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via vectors such as (1) record-route and (2) timestamp IP options with the needaddr bit set and a truncated value.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
