# CVE-2006-1014

- Published: 2006-03-07T00:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:30:00

Argument injection vulnerability in certain PHP 4.x and 5.x applications, when used with sendmail and when accepting remote input for the additional_parameters argument to the mb_send_mail function, allows context-dependent attackers to read and create arbitrary files by providing extra -C and -X arguments to sendmail.  NOTE: it could be argued that this is a class of technology-specific vulnerability, instead of a particular instance; if so, then this should not be included in CVE. This vulnerability affects all versions of PHP from 4.0.x through 5.1.x
