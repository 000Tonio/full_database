# CVE-2006-6565

- Published: 2006-12-15T11:28:00

- Modified: 2020-07-28T16:36:00

FileZilla Server before 0.9.22 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a wildcard argument to the (1) LIST or (2) NLST commands, which results in a NULL pointer dereference, a different set of vectors than CVE-2006-6564.  NOTE: CVE analysis suggests that the problem might be due to a malformed PORT command.

### CVSS Score: **4**
