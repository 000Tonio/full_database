# CVE-2006-6493

- Published: 2006-12-13T00:28:00

- Modified: 2011-03-08T02:46:00

Buffer overflow in the krbv4_ldap_auth function in servers/slapd/kerberos.c in OpenLDAP 2.4.3 and earlier, when OpenLDAP is compiled with the --enable-kbind (Kerberos KBIND) option, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an LDAP bind request using the LDAP_AUTH_KRBV41 authentication method and long credential data. Successful exploitation requires that OpenLDAP allows the use of the LDAPv2 protocol, and is compiled with the --enable-kbind (Kerberos KBIND) option which has been disabled by default since version 2.0.2 and was removed from the configure script in the 2.1 release.
