Stack-based buffer overflow in the create_named_pipe function in libmysql.c in PHP 4.3.10 and 4.4.x before 4.4.3 for Windows allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long (1) arg_host or (2) arg_unix_socket argument, as demonstrated by a long named pipe variable in the host argument to the mysql_connect function.
