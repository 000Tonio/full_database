# CVE-2006-1526

- Published: 2006-05-02T21:06:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:33:00

Buffer overflow in the X render (Xrender) extension in X.org X server 6.8.0 up to allows attackers to cause a denial of service (crash), as demonstrated by the (1) XRenderCompositeTriStrip and (2) XRenderCompositeTriFan requests in the rendertest from XCB xcb/xcb-demo, which leads to an incorrect memory allocation due to a typo in an expression that uses a "&" instead of a "*" operator. NOTE: the subject line of the original announcement used an incorrect CVE number for this issue.
