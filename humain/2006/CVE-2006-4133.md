# CVE-2006-4133

- Published: 2006-08-14T23:04:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:33:00

Heap-based buffer overflow in SAP Internet Graphics Service (IGS) 6.40 and earlier, and 7.00 and earlier, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via an HTTP request with an ADM:GETLOGFILE command and a long portwatcher argument, which triggers the overflow during error message construction when the _snprintf function returns a negative value that is used in a memcpy operation. Upgrade patches
