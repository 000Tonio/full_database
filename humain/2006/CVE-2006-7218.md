- Published: 2007-07-06T19:30:00

- Modified: 2015-07-28T14:35:00

eZ publish before 3.8.1 does not properly enforce permissions for "content edit Language" when there are four or more languages, which allows remote authenticated users to perform translations into languages that are not listed in a Module Function Limitation policy.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
