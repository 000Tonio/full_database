** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in centipaid_class.php in CentiPaid 1.4.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a URL in the class_pwd parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by CVE and multiple third parties, who state that $class_pwd is set to a static value before the relevant include statement. This is not exploitable.

### CVSS Score: **5.1**
