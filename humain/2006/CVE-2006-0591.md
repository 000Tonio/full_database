# CVE-2006-0591

- Published: 2006-02-08T01:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:45:00

The crypt_gensalt functions for BSDI-style extended DES-based and FreeBSD-sytle MD5-based password hashes in crypt_blowfish 0.4.7 and earlier do not evenly and randomly distribute salts, which makes it easier for attackers to guess passwords from a stolen password file due to the increased number of collisions. This vulnerability may only be exploited in conjunction with another vulnerability.  The password file (normally shadowed) must first be stolen.

### CVSS Score: **1.2**
