Control cards for Cisco Optical Networking System (ONS) 15000 series nodes before 20060405 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (card reset) via (1) a "crafted" IP packet to a device with secure mode EMS-to-network-element access, aka bug ID CSCsc51390; (2) a "crafted" IP packet to a device with IP on the LAN interface, aka bug ID CSCsd04168; and (3) a "malformed" OSPF packet, aka bug ID CSCsc54558.
