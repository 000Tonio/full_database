Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Irokez CMS 0.7.1 and earlier, when register_globals is enabled, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the (1) GLOBALS[PTH][func] parameter in (a) scripts/gallery.scr.php; the (2) GLOBALS[PTH][spaw] parameter in (b) scripts/xtextarea.scr.php; and the (3) GLOBALS[PTH][classes] parameter in (c) sitemap.scr.php, (d) news.scr.php, (e) polls.scr.php, (f) rss.scr.php, (g) search.scr.php in scripts/, and (h) form.fun.php, (i) general.func.php, (j) groups.func.php, (k) js.func.php, (l) sections.func.php, and (m) users.func.php in functions/. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
