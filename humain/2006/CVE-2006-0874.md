Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Intensive Point iUser Ecommerce before 2.2 have unspecified vectors and impact, as addressed by "Urgent secure fixes".  NOTE: this might be a duplicate of CVE-2006-0854, but the vendor announcement for this issue (from January 8, 2005) is too vague to be sure, and CVE-2006-0854 does not provide version information.
