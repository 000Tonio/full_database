- Published: 2006-03-09T00:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:30:00

Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in PHP-Stats 0.1.9.1 and earlier allow remote attackers to read and possibly execute arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in the (1) option[language] and (2) option[template] parameters, and (3) possibly other parameters, to (a) admin.php and (b) other unspecified scripts.  NOTE: the admin.php/option[language] vector can be used by remote unauthenticated attackers to include arbitrary files in conjunction with CVE-2006-1085.
