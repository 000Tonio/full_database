- Published: 2006-03-23T11:06:00

- Modified: 2020-02-24T14:15:00

The SSL server implementation in NILE.NLM in Novell NetWare 6.5 and Novell Open Enterprise Server (OES) sometimes selects a weak cipher instead of an available stronger cipher, which makes it easier for remote attackers to sniff and decrypt an SSL protected session.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
