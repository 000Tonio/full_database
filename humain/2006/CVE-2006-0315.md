# CVE-2006-0315

- Published: 2006-01-19T01:03:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:44:00

index.php in EZDatabase before 2.1.2 does not properly cleanse the p parameter before constructing and including a .php filename, which allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks, and produces resultant cross-site scripting (XSS) and path disclosure.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
