# CVE-2006-1888

- Published: 2006-04-20T10:02:00

phpGraphy 0.9.11 and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and gain administrator privileges via a direct request to index.php with the editwelcome parameter set to 1, which can then be used to modify the main page to inject arbitrary HTML and web script.  NOTE: XSS attacks are resultant from this issue, since normal functionality allows the admin to modify pages.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
