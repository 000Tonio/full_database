Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in DSNewsletter 1.0, with magic_quotes_gpc disabled, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the email parameter to (1) include/sub.php, (2) include/confirm.php, or (3) include/unconfirm.php. Successful exploitation requires that the "magic_quotes_gpc" parameter is disabled.
