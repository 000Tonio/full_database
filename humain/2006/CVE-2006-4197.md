# CVE-2006-4197

- Published: 2006-08-17T21:04:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:33:00

Multiple buffer overflows in libmusicbrainz (aka mb_client or MusicBrainz Client Library) 2.1.2 and earlier, and SVN 8406 and earlier, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code via (1) a long Location header by the HTTP server, which triggers an overflow in the MBHttp::Download function in lib/http.cpp; and (2) a long URL in RDF data, as demonstrated by a URL in an rdf:resource field in an RDF XML document, which triggers overflows in many functions in lib/rdfparse.c.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
