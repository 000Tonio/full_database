- Published: 2006-05-12T00:02:00

Multiple integer overflows in the DPRPC library (DPRPCNLM.NLM) NDPS/iPrint module in Novell Distributed Print Services in Novell NetWare 6.5 SP3, SP4, and SP5 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an XDR encoded array with a field that specifies a large number of elements, which triggers the overflows in the ndps_xdr_array function. Apply fix for Novell NetWare 6.5 Support Pack 3, 4, or 5.
