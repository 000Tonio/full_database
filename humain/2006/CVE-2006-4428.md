** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in index.php in Jupiter CMS 1.1.5 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the template parameter.  NOTE: CVE disputes this claim, since the $template variable is defined as a static value before it is referenced in an include statement.
