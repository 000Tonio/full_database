Melange Chat Server (aka M-Chat), when accessed via a web browser, automatically sends cookies and other sensitive information for a server to any port specified in the associated link, which allows local users on that server to read the cookies from HTTP headers and possibly gain sensitive information, such as credentials, by setting up a listening port and reading the credentials when the victim clicks on the link.
