The "mechglue" abstraction interface of the GSS-API library for Kerberos 5 1.5 through 1.5.1, as used in Kerberos administration daemon (kadmind) and other products that use this library, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via unspecified vectors that cause mechglue to free uninitialized pointers.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
