Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in BasiliX 1.1.1 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the (1) BSX_LIBDIR parameter in scripts in /files/ including (a) abook.php3, (b) compose-attach.php3, (c) compose-menu.php3, (d) compose-new.php3, (e) compose-send.php3, (f) folder-create.php3, (g) folder-delete.php3, (h) folder-empty.php3, (i) folder-rename.php3, (j) folders.php3, (k) mbox-action.php3, (l) mbox-list.php3, (m) message-delete.php3, (n) message-forward.php3, (o) message-header.php3, (p) message-print.php3, (q) message-read.php3, (r) message-reply.php3, (s) message-replyall.php3, (t) message-search.php3, or (u) settings.php3; and the (2) BSX_HTXDIR parameter in (v) files/login.php3. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
