The login redirection mechanism in the Drupal 4.7 Pubcookie module before 1.2.2.4 2006/09/06 and the Drupal 4.6 Pubcookie module before 1.6.2.1 2006/09/07 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication requirements and spoof identities of arbitrary users via unspecified vectors. Drupal core is not affected. If you do not use the pubcookie module, no action is necessary.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
