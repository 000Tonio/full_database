- Published: 2006-06-27T10:05:00

- Modified: 2017-07-20T01:32:00

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in openwebmail-read.pl in Open WebMail (OWM) 2.52, and other versions released before 06/18/2006, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the from field.  NOTE: some third party sources have mentioned the "to" and "from" fields, although CVE analysis shows that these are associated with the previous version, a different executable, and a different CVE.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
