Linux kernel 2.6.16-rc2 and earlier, when running on x86_64 systems with preemption enabled, allows local users to cause a denial of service (oops) via multiple ptrace tasks that perform single steps, which can cause corruption of the DEBUG_STACK stack during the do_debug function call.

### CVSS Score: **1.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
