# CVE-2006-5170

- Published: 2006-10-10T04:06:00

- Modified: 2022-02-25T19:20:00

pam_ldap in nss_ldap on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4, Fedora Core 3 and earlier, and possibly other distributions does not return an error condition when an LDAP directory server responds with a PasswordPolicyResponse control response, which causes the pam_authenticate function to return a success code even if authentication has failed, as originally reported for xscreensaver.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
