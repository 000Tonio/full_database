# CVE-2006-5484

- Published: 2006-10-24T22:07:00

- Modified: 2019-08-28T14:49:00

SSH Tectia Client/Server/Connector 5.1.0 and earlier, Manager 2.2.0 and earlier, and other products, when using an RSA key with exponent 3, removes PKCS-1 padding before generating a hash, which allows remote attackers to forge a PKCS #1 v1.5 signature that is signed by that RSA key and prevents Tectia from correctly verifying X.509 and other certificates that use PKCS #1, a similar issue to CVE-2006-4339. Update to a fixed version

### CVSS Score: **5**
