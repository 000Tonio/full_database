Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Two Shoes M-Factory (TSMF) SimpleBoard 1.1.0 Stable (aka com_simpleboard), as used in Mambo and Joomla!, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the Name field in "post ne topic" in the Frontend, (2) the Title (aka Community-Title) field in Simpleboard Configuration in the Backend Admin Panel, and the (3) Name (aka Forum-Title) and (4) Name (aka Category-Title) fields in Simpleboard Administration in the Backend Admin Panel.  NOTE: some sources have stated that the sb_authorname parameter is affected, but it is unclear which field is related to it. Successful exploitation requires that the product is used in Mambo or Joomla!.
