The kernel in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, when running on SMP systems, allows local users to cause a denial of service (deadlock) by running the shmat function on an shm at the same time that shmctl is removing that shm (IPC_RMID), which prevents a spinlock from being unlocked.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
