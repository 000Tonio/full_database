# CVE-2006-1990

- Published: 2006-04-24T23:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:37:00

Integer overflow in the wordwrap function in string.c in PHP 4.4.2 and 5.1.2 might allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via certain long arguments that cause a small buffer to be allocated, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow in a memcpy function call, a different vulnerability than CVE-2002-1396.
