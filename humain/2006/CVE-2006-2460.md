Sugar Suite Open Source (SugarCRM) 4.2 and earlier, when register_globals is enabled, does not protect critical variables such as $_GLOBALS and $_SESSION from modification, which allows remote attackers to conduct attacks such as directory traversal or PHP remote file inclusion, as demonstrated by modifying the GLOBALS[sugarEntry] parameter.
