Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in WordPress before 2.0.4 have unknown impact and remote attack vectors.  NOTE: due to lack of details, it is not clear how these issues are different from CVE-2006-3389 and CVE-2006-3390, although it is likely that 2.0.4 addresses an unspecified issue related to "Anyone can register" functionality (user registration for guests).

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
