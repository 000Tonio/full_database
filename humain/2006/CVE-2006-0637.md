Buffer overflow in cram.dll in QUALCOMM Eudora WorldMail 3.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an IMAP APPEND command with a long message literal argument, as demonstrated by Worldmail.pl. NOTE: this is a different vector and a different manipulation than CVE-2005-4267, so it might be a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-4267.
