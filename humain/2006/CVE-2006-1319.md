# CVE-2006-1319

- Published: 2006-03-20T11:02:00

- Modified: 2017-07-20T01:30:00

chpst in runit 1.3.3-1 for Debian GNU/Linux, when compiled on little endian i386 machines against dietlibc, does not properly handle when multiple groups are specified in the -u option, which causes chpst to assign permissions for the root group due to inconsistent bit sizes for the gid_t type. This vulnerability may be relevant only to Debian GNU/Linux implementations on little endian i386 machines.
