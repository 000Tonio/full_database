Microsoft Internet Explorer before Windows XP Service Pack 2 and Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1, when Prompt is configured in Security Settings, uses modal dialogs to verify that a user wishes to run an ActiveX control or perform other risky actions, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to construct a race condition that tricks a user into clicking an object or pressing keys that are actually applied to a "Yes" approval for executing the control.

### CVSS Score: **5.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
