# CVE-2006-6264

- Published: 2006-12-04T11:28:00

Teredo creates trusted peer entries for arbitrary incoming source Teredo addresses, even if the low 32 bits represent an intranet address, which might allow remote attackers to send IPv4 traffic to intranet hosts that use non-RFC1918 addresses, bypassing IPv4 ingress filtering.
