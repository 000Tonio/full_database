Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in OpenDock Easy Blog 1.4 and earlier, when register_globals is enabled, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the doc_directory parameter in (1) down_stat.php, (2) file.php, (3) find_file.php, (4) lib_read_file.php, and (5) lib_form_file.php in sw/lib_up_file; (6) find_comment.php, (7) comment.php, and (8) lib_comment.php in sw/lib_comment/; (9) sw/lib_find/find.php; and other unspecified vectors. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
