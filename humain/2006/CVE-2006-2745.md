Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in F@cile Interactive Web 0.8.5 and earlier, when register_globals is enabled, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the (1) pathfile parameter in (a) p-editpage.php and (b) p-editbox.php, and the (2) mytheme and (3) myskin parameters in multiple "p-themes" index.inc.php files including (c) lowgraphic, (d) classic, (e) puzzle, (f) simple, and (g) ciao. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
