index.php in Phpclanwebsite 1.23.1 allows remote authenticated users to obtain the installation path by specifying an invalid file name to the uploader page, as demonstrated by "\", which will display the full path of uploader.php.  NOTE: this might be the result of a file inclusion vulnerability. Please add the following to the config.php file to avoid all such exploits.

ini_set('display_errors', false);
