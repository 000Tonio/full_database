SQL injection vulnerability in DSLogin 1.0, with magic_quotes_gpc disabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands and bypass authentication via the $log_userid variable in (1) index.php and (2) admin/index.php. Successful exploitation requires that the "magic_quotes_gpc" parameter is disabled.
