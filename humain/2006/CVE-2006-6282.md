# CVE-2006-6282

- Published: 2006-12-04T11:28:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:47:00

members.php in Vikingboard 0.1.2 allows remote attackers to trigger a forced SQL error via an invalid s parameter, a different vector than CVE-2006-4709.  NOTE: might only be an exposure if display_errors is enabled, but due to lack of details, even this is not clear.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
