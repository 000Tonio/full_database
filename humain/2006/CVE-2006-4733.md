PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in sipssys/code/box.inc.php in Haakon Nilsen simple, integrated publishing system (SIPS) 0.3.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the config[sipssys] parameter.  NOTE: the product's documentation recommends placing the affected file outside of the web root, so the scope of issue is limited to admins who do not, or cannot, follow this recommendation.
