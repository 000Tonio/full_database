The embedded HTTP server in Fuji Xerox Printing Systems (FXPS) print engine, as used in products including (1) Dell 3000cn through 5110cn and (2) Fuji Xerox DocuPrint firmware before 20060628 and Network Option Card firmware before 5.13, does not properly perform authentication for HTTP requests, which allows remote attackers to modify system configuration via crafted requests, including changing the administrator password or causing a denial of service to the print server.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
