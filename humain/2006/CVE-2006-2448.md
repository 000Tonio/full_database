# CVE-2006-2448

- Published: 2006-06-23T10:02:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:16:00

Linux kernel before 2.6.16.21 and 2.6.17, when running on PowerPC, does not perform certain required access_ok checks, which allows local users to read arbitrary kernel memory on 64-bit systems (signal_64.c) and cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly read kernel memory on 32-bit systems (signal_32.c).

### CVSS Score: **5.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | COMPLETE |
