system/workplace/views/admin/admin-main.jsp in Alkacon OpenCms before 6.2.2 does not restrict access to administrator functions, which allows remote authenticated users to (1) send broadcast messages to all users (/workplace/broadcast), (2) list all users (/accounts/users), (3) add webusers (/accounts/webusers/new), (4) upload database import and export files (/database/importhttp), (5) upload arbitrary program modules (/modules/modules_import), and (6) read the log file (/workplace/logfileview) by setting the appropriate value for the path parameter in a direct request to admin-main.jsp.
