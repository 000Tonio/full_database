Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in include.php in PHPKIT 1.6.1 Release 2 and earlier, with allow_url_fopen enabled, allows remote attackers to conduct PHP remote file include attacks via a path parameter that specifies a (1) UNC share or (2) ftps URL, which bypasses the check for "http://", "ftp://", and "https://" URLs.
