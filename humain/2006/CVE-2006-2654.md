Directory traversal vulnerability in smbfs smbfs on FreeBSD 4.10 up to 6.1 allows local users to escape chroot restrictions for an SMB-mounted filesystem via "..\\" sequences.  NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2006-1864, but this is a different implementation of smbfs, so it has a different CVE identifier.
