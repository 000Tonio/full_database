# CVE-2006-1649

- Published: 2006-04-06T10:04:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:33:00

The "restore to" selection in the "quarantine a file" capability of ESET NOD32 before 2.51.26 allows a restore to any directory that permits read access by the invoking user, which allows local users to create new files despite write-access directory permissions. ESET NOD32 Antivirus version 2.51.26 fixes this vulnerability.  All versions of this product prior to 2.51.26 are vulnerable.
