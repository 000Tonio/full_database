add.asp in DUware DUbanner 3.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by uploading files with arbitrary extensions, such as ASP files, probably due to client-side enforcement that can be bypassed.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information, since the raw source is vague.
