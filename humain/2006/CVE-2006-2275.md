Linux SCTP (lksctp) before 2.6.17 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (deadlock) via a large number of small messages to a receiver application that cannot process the messages quickly enough, which leads to "spillover of the receive buffer."

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
