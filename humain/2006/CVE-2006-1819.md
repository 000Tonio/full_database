Directory traversal vulnerability in the loadConfig function in index.php in phpWebSite 0.10.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to include arbitrary local files and execute arbitrary PHP code via the hub_dir parameter, as demonstrated by including access_log.  NOTE: in some cases, arbitrary remote file inclusion could be performed under PHP 5 using an SMB share argument such as "\\systemname\sharename".
