** DISPUTED **  QueryString.php in Simple Machines Forum (SMF) 1.0.7 and earlier, and 1.1rc2 and earlier, allows remote attackers to more easily spoof the IP address and evade banning via a modified X-Forwarded-For HTTP header, which is preferred instead of other more reliable sources for the IP address.  NOTE: the original researcher claims that the vendor has disputed this issue.
