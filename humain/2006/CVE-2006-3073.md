- Published: 2006-06-19T10:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:26:00

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the WebVPN feature in the Cisco VPN 3000 Series Concentrators and Cisco ASA 5500 Series Adaptive Security Appliances (ASA), when in WebVPN clientless mode, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the domain parameter in (1) dnserror.html and (2) connecterror.html, aka bugid CSCsd81095 (VPN3k) and CSCse48193 (ASA). NOTE: the vendor states that "WebVPN full-network-access mode" is not affected, despite the claims by the original researcher.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
