eZ publish before 3.8.5 does not properly enforce permissions for editing in a specific language, which allows remote authenticated users to create a draft in an unauthorized language by editing an archived version of an object, and then using Manage Versions to copy this version to a new draft.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
