# CVE-2006-6017

- Published: 2006-11-21T23:07:00

WordPress before 2.0.5 does not properly store a profile containing a string representation of a serialized object, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a string that represents a (1) malformed or (2) large serialized object, because the object triggers automatic unserialization for display.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
