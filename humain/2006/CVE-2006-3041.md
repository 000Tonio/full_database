** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in Ltwcalendar/calendar.php in Codewalkers Ltwcalendar 4.1.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the ltw_config[include_dir] parameter. NOTE: CVE disputes this claim, since the $ltw_config[include_dir] variable is defined as a static value in an include file before it is referenced in an include() statement.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
