stats.php in Destiney Rated Images Script 0.5.0 allows remote attackers to obtain the installation path via an invalid s parameter, which displays the path in an error message.  NOTE: this issue was originally claimed to be SQL injection, but CVE analysis shows that the problem is related to an invalid value that prevents some variables from being set.
