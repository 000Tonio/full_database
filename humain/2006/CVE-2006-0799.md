# CVE-2006-0799

- Published: 2006-02-19T21:02:00

Microsoft Internet Explorer allows remote attackers to spoof a legitimate URL in the status bar and conduct a phishing attack via a web page with an anchor element with a legitimate "href" attribute, a form whose action points to a malicious URL, and an INPUT submit element that is modified to look like a legitimate URL.  NOTE: this issue is very similar to CVE-2004-1104, although the manipulations are slightly different.
