# CVE-2006-0228

- Published: 2006-01-17T21:03:00

- Modified: 2017-07-20T01:29:00

The RBAC functionality in grsecurity before 2.1.8 does not properly handle when the admin role creates a service and then exits the shell without unauthenticating, which causes the service to be restarted with the admin role still active.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
