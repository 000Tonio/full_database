# CVE-2006-3122

- Published: 2006-08-09T22:04:00

- Modified: 2011-06-13T04:00:00

The supersede_lease function in memory.c in ISC DHCP (dhcpd) server 2.0pl5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a DHCPDISCOVER packet with a 32 byte client-identifier, which causes the packet to be interpreted as a corrupt uid and causes the server to exit with "corrupt lease uid."
