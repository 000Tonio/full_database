- Published: 2006-07-18T15:40:00

- Modified: 2022-05-13T18:15:00

auth.c in LibVNCServer 0.7.1 allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a request in which the client specifies an insecure security type such as "Type 1 - None", which is accepted even if it is not offered by the server, a different issue than CVE-2006-2369.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| --- | --- | --- |
