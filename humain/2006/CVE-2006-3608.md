The Gallery module in Simone Vellei Flatnuke 2.5.7 and earlier, when Gallery uploads are enabled, does not restrict the extensions of uploaded files that begin with a GIF header, which allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary PHP code via an uploaded .php file. Successful exploitation requires that Gallery uploads are enabled.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
