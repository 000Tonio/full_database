# CVE-2006-1368

- Published: 2006-03-23T23:06:00

- Modified: 2018-10-03T21:36:00

Buffer overflow in the USB Gadget RNDIS implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.16 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (kmalloc'd memory corruption) via a remote NDIS response to OID_GEN_SUPPORTED_LIST, which causes memory to be allocated for the reply data but not the reply structure. Update to version 2.6.16.
