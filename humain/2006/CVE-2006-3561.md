BT Voyager 2091 Wireless firmware 2.21.05.08m_A2pB018c1.d16d and earlier, and 3.01m and earlier, allow remote attackers to bypass the authentication process and gain sensitive information, such as configuration information via (1) /btvoyager_getconfig.sh, PPP credentials via (2) btvoyager_getpppcreds.sh, and decode configuration credentials via (3) btvoyager_decoder.c.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| --- | --- | --- |
