# CVE-2006-2406

- Published: 2006-05-16T10:02:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T21:04:00

Directory traversal vulnerability in bb_lib/abbc.css.php in Unclassified NewsBoard (UNB) 1.5.3-d and possibly earlier versions, when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to include arbitrary files via .. (dot dot) sequences and a trailing null byte (%00) in the design_path parameter.  NOTE: this is closely related, but a different vulnerability than the ABBC[Config][smileset] parameter.
