# CVE-2006-2743

Drupal 4.6.x before 4.6.7 and 4.7.0, when running on Apache with mod_mime, does not properly handle files with multiple extensions, which allows remote attackers to upload, modify, or execute arbitrary files in the files directory. Successful exploitation requires that the "mod_mime" module is installed in Apache, and that a " .htaccess" file has not been used to restrict access to the directory.
This vulnerability is addressed in the following product releases:
Drupal, Drupal, 4.7.1 
Drupal, Drupal, 4.6.7
