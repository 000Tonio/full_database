Integer signedness error in the network_receive_packet function in socket.c in dimension 3 engine (dim3) 1.5 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a large data_len value, which is cast to a signed short and results in a buffer overflow.
