# CVE-2006-2656

- Published: 2006-05-30T18:02:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:16:00

Stack-based buffer overflow in the tiffsplit command in libtiff 3.8.2 and earlier might might allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long filename. NOTE: tiffsplit is not setuid. If there is not a common scenario under which tiffsplit is called with attacker-controlled command line arguments, then perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.
