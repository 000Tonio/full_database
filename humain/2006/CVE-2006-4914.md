Directory traversal vulnerability in A.l-Pifou 1.8p2 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via ".." sequences in the ze_langue_02 cookie, as demonstrated by using the choix_lng parameter to choix_langue.php to indirectly set the cookie, then accessing livre_dor.php to trigger the inclusion from inc/change_lang_ck.php, possibly related to livre_livre.php.  NOTE: the livre_livre.php relationship has been reported by some third party sources.
