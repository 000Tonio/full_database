# CVE-2006-6753

- Published: 2006-12-27T01:28:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:49:00

Event Viewer (eventvwr.exe) in Microsoft Windows does not properly display log data that contains '%' (percent) characters, which might make it impossible to use Event Viewer to determine the actual data that triggered an event, and might produce long strings that are not properly handled by certain processes that rely on Event Viewer.
