# CVE-2006-1339

- Published: 2006-03-21T02:06:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:32:00

Directory traversal vulnerability in inc/functions.inc.php in CuteNews 1.4.1 and possibly other versions, when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to include arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) sequence and trailing NULL (%00) byte in the archive parameter in an HTTP POST or COOKIE request, which bypasses a sanity check that is only applied to a GET request.

### CVSS Score: **5**
