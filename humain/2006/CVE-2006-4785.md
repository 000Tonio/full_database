# CVE-2006-4785

SQL injection vulnerability in blog/edit.php in Moodle 1.6.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the format parameter as stored in the $blogEntry variable, which is not properly handled by the insert_record function, which calls _adodb_column_sql in the adodb layer (lib/adodb/adodb-lib.inc.php), which does not convert the data type to an int.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
