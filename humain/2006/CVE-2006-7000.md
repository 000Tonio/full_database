Headstart Solutions DeskPRO allows remote attackers to obtain the full path via direct requests to (1) email/mail.php, (2) includes/init.php, (3) certain files in includes/cron/, and (4) jpgraph.php, (5) jpgraph_bar.php, (6) jpgraph_pie.php, and (7) jpgraph_pie3d.php in includes/graph/, which leaks the path in error messages.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
