Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in ViArt Shop Free 2.5.5, and possibly other distributions including Light, Standard, and Enterprise, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) forum_id parameter in forum.php, which is not properly handled in block_forum_topics.php, and (2) item_id parameter in reviews.php, which is not properly handled in block_reviews.php.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
