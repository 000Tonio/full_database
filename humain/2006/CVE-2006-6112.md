# CVE-2006-6112

- Published: 2006-12-06T22:28:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:46:00

LifeType 1.0.x and 1.1.x have insufficient access control for all of the PHP scripts under (1) class/ and (2) plugins/, which allows remote attackers to obtain the installation path via a direct request to any of the scripts, as demonstrated by (a) bayesianfilter.class.php and (b) bootstrap.php, which leaks the path in an error message.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
