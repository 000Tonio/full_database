Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Your_Account module in PHP-Nuke 7.8 might allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTML and web script via the ublock parameter, which is saved in the user's personal menu.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information. In addition, it is unclear whether this issue is a vulnerability, since it is related to the user's personal menu, which presumably is not modifiable by others.
