# CVE-2006-3824

- Published: 2006-07-25T13:22:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:31:00

systeminfo.c for Sun Solaris allows local users to read kernel memory via a 0 variable count argument to the sysinfo system call, which causes a -1 argument to be used by the copyout function.  NOTE: this issue has been referred to as an integer overflow, but it is probably more like a signedness error or integer underflow. This vulnerability is addressed in the following product releases:
Sun, Solaris, 10_x86 patch 118833-09 or later
Sun, Solaris, 10 patch 118855-06 or later
