# CVE-2006-7094

- Published: 2007-03-02T21:18:00

- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:29:00

ftpd, as used by Gentoo and Debian Linux, sets the gid to the effective uid instead of the effective group id before executing /bin/ls, which allows remote authenticated users to list arbitrary directories with the privileges of gid 0 and possibly enable additional attack vectors.

### CVSS Score: **8.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
