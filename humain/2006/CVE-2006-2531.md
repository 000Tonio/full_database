Ipswitch WhatsUp Professional 2006 only verifies the user's identity via HTTP headers, which allows remote attackers to spoof being a trusted console and bypass authentication by setting HTTP User-Agent header to "Ipswitch/1.0" and the User-Application header to "NmConsole".

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
