Heap-based buffer overflow in Microsoft DirectX SDK (February 2006) and probably earlier, including 9.0c End User Runtimes, allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted Targa file with a run-length-encoding (RLE) compression that produces more data than expected when decoding.
