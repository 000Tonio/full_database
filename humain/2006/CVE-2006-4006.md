# CVE-2006-4006

- Published: 2006-08-07T19:04:00

- Modified: 2017-07-20T01:32:00

The do_gameinfo function in BomberClone 0.11.6 and earlier, and possibly other functions, does not reset the packet data size, which causes the send_pkg function (packets.c) to use this data size when sending a reply, and allows remote attackers to read portions of server memory.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
