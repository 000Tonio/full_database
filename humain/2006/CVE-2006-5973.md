Off-by-one buffer overflow in Dovecot 1.0test53 through 1.0.rc14, and possibly other versions, when index files are used and mmap_disable is set to "yes," allows remote authenticated IMAP or POP3 users to cause a denial of service (crash) via unspecified vectors involving the cache file.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
