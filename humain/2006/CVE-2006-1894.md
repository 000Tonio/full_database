# CVE-2006-1894

- Published: 2006-04-20T10:02:00

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in RevoBoard 1.8, as derived from PunBB, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a substitution cipher of the email tag, which is transformed when the application's e-mail address obfuscator reverses the transformation.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this is a site-specific issue; however, the claimed codebase relationship with PunBB might be relevant.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
