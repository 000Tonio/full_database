- Published: 2006-08-31T21:04:00

The cURL extension files (1) ext/curl/interface.c and (2) ext/curl/streams.c in PHP before 5.1.5 permit the CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION option when open_basedir or safe_mode is enabled, which allows attackers to perform unauthorized actions, possibly related to the realpath cache.
