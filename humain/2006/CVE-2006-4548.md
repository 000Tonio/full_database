# CVE-2006-4548

- Published: 2006-09-06T00:04:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:37:00

e107 0.75 and earlier does not properly unset variables when the input data includes a numeric parameter with a value matching an alphanumeric parameter's hash value, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via the tinyMCE_imglib_include image/jpeg parameter in e107_handlers/tiny_mce/plugins/ibrowser/ibrowser.php, as demonstrated by a multipart/form-data request.  NOTE: it could be argued that this vulnerability is due to a bug in the unset PHP command (CVE-2006-3017) and the proper fix should be in PHP; if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in e107.
