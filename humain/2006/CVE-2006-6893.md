# CVE-2006-6893

- Published: 2006-12-31T05:00:00

Tor allows remote attackers to discover the IP address of a hidden service by accessing this service at a high rate, thereby changing the server's CPU temperature and consequently changing the pattern of time values visible through (1) ICMP timestamps, (2) TCP sequence numbers, and (3) TCP timestamps, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-0414. NOTE: it could be argued that this is a laws-of-physics vulnerability that is a fundamental design limitation of certain hardware implementations, so perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.
