Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Wim Fleischhauer docpile: wim's edition (docpile:we) 0.2.2 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the INIT_PATH parameter to (1) lib/folder.class.php, (2) lib/email.inc.php, (3) lib/document.class.php or (4) lib/auth.inc.php. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
