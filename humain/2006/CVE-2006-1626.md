Internet Explorer 6 for Windows XP SP2 and earlier allows remote attackers to spoof the address bar and possibly conduct phishing attacks by re-opening the window to a malicious Shockwave Flash application, then changing the window location back to a trusted URL while the Flash application is still loading.  NOTE: this is a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-1192.
