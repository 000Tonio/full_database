# CVE-2006-0188

- Published: 2006-02-24T00:02:00

webmail.php in SquirrelMail 1.4.0 to 1.4.5 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web pages into the right frame via a URL in the right_frame parameter.  NOTE: this has been called a cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, but it is different than what is normally identified as XSS.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
