CRLF injection vulnerability in lib/session.php in Hastymail 1.5 and earlier before 20061008 allows remote authenticated users to send arbitrary IMAP commands via a CRLF sequence in a mailbox name.  NOTE: the attack crosses privilege boundaries if the IMAP server configuration prevents a user from establishing a direct IMAP session.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
