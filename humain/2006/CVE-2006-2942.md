# CVE-2006-2942

- Published: 2006-06-20T18:02:00

TWiki 4.0.0, 4.0.1, and 4.0.2 allows remote attackers to gain Twiki administrator privileges via a TWiki.TWikiRegistration form with a modified action attribute that references the Sandbox web instead of the user web, which can then be used to associate the user's login name with the WikiName of a member of the TWikiAdminGroup. Successful exploitation requires that the "MapUserToWikiName" setting is enabled.

### CVSS Score: **5.1**
