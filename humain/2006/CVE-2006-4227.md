MySQL before 5.0.25 and 5.1 before 5.1.12 evaluates arguments of suid routines in the security context of the routine's definer instead of the routine's caller, which allows remote authenticated users to gain privileges through a routine that has been made available using GRANT EXECUTE.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
