Multiple direct static code injection vulnerabilities in db/txt.inc.php in phpPowerCards 2.10, when register_globals is enabled, allow remote attackers to create or overwrite arbitrary files via the (1) email[to], (2) email[from], (3) name[to], (4) name[from], (5) picture, (6) comment, or (7) sessionID parameter, as demonstrated by creating a new .php file that permits remote file inclusion, and then requesting this file.
