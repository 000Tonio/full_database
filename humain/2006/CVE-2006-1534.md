Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Null news allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via (1) the user_email parameter in (a) lostpass.php, and the (2) user_email and (3) user_username parameters in (b) sub.php and (c) unsub.php. Succesful exploitation of this vulnerability requires the "magic_quotes_gpc" parameter to be disabled.
