SQL injection vulnerability in the topic deletion functionality (post_delete function in func_mod.php) for Invision Power Board 2.1.5 allows remote authenticated moderators to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the selectedpids parameter, which bypasses an integer value check when the $id variable is an array.
