** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in DoubleSpeak 0.1, when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via the config[private] parameter in multiple files, as demonstrated by (1) index.php, (2) faq.php, and (3) hardware.php. NOTE: this issue has been disputed by multiple third-party researchers, who state that config[private] is initialized in an include file before being used.
