The TIFFFetchShortPair function in tif_dirread.c in libtiff 3.8.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted TIFF image that triggers a NULL pointer dereference, possibly due to changes in type declarations and/or the TIFFVSetField function. Per: http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html
'CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference'
