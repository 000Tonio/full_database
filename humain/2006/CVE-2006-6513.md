# CVE-2006-6513

- Published: 2006-12-14T01:28:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:49:00

The CControl::Download function (/dl URI) in Winamp Web Interface (Wawi) 7.5.13 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to download arbitrary file types under the root via a trailing "." (dot) in a filename in the file parameter, related to erroneous behavior of the IsWinampFile function. The attacker needs the required privileges related to the function he
wants to exploit.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
