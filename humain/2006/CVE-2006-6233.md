SQL injection vulnerability in the Downloads module for unknown versions of PostNuke allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the lid parameter in a viewdownloaddetails operation. NOTE: this issue might have been in the viewdownloaddetails function in dl-downloaddetails.php, but PostNuke 0.764 does not appear to have this issue.
