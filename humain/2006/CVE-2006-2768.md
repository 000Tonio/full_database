PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in METAjour 2.1, when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via the (1) system_path parameter in a large number of files in the (a) app/edocument/, (b) app/eproject/, (c) app/erek/, and (d) extension/ directories, and the (2) GLOBALS[system_path] parameter in (e) extension/sitemap/sitemap.datatype.php. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
