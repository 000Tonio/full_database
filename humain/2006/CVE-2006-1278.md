SQL injection vulnerability in @1 File Store 2006.03.07 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the id parameter to (1) functions.php and (2) user.php in the libs directory, (3) edit.php and (4) delete.php in control/files/, (5) edit.php and (6) delete.php in control/users/, (7) edit.php, (8) access.php, and (9) in control/folders/, (10) access.php and (11) delete.php in control/groups/, (12) confirm.php, and (13) download.php; (14) the email parameter in password.php, and (15) the id parameter in folder.php.  NOTE: it was later reported that vectors 12 and 13 also affect @1 File Store PRO 3.2. Successful exploitation requires that the "magic_quotes_gpc" parameter is disabled.
