Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Jim Hu and Chad Little PHP iCalendar 2.23 rc1 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) getdate parameter in (a) day.php, (b) month.php, (c) year.php, (d) week.php, (e) search.php, (f) rss/index.php, (g) print.php, and (h) preferences.php; the (2) cpath parameter in (i) day.php, (j) month.php, (k) year.php, (l) week.php, and (m) search.php; the (3) query parameter in search.php; and possibly the cpath, (4) unset, and (5) set parameters in a setcookie action in preferences.php; different vectors than CVE-2006-3319.  NOTE: it was later reported that vectors b, c, and d also affect 2.24.
