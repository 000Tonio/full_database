Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Wim Fleischhauer docpile: wim's edition (docpile:we) 0.2.2 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the INIT_PATH parameter to (1) lib/access.inc.php, (2) lib/folders.inc.php, (3) lib/init.inc.php or (4) lib/templates.inc.php.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained from third party information. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
