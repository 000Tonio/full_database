# CVE-2006-4117

- Published: 2006-08-14T21:04:00

The squeue_drain function in Sun Solaris 10, possibly only when run on CMT processors, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service ("bad trap" and system panic) by opening and closing a large number of TCP connections ("heavy TCP/IP loads").  NOTE: the original report specifies the function name as "drain_squeue," but this is likely incorrect. It is reportedly unlikely that this affects systems not using CMT processors.
