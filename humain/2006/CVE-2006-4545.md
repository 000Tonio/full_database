# CVE-2006-4545

- Published: 2006-09-06T00:04:00

** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in ModuleBased CMS Pre-Alpha allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via the _SERVER parameter in (1) admin/avatar.php, (2) libs/archive.class.php, (3) libs/login.php, (4) libs/profiles.class.php, and (5) libs/profile/proccess.php.  NOTE: CVE disputes this claim, as the _SERVER array and the _SERVER[DOCUMENT_ROOT] index are controlled by PHP and cannot be manipulated by an attacker.
