SQL injection vulnerability in index.php in Phpclanwebsite (aka PCW) 1.23.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) par parameter in the post function on the forum page and possibly the (2) poll_id parameter on the poll page.  NOTE: the poll_id vector can also allow resultant cross-site scripting (XSS) from an unquoted error message for invalid SQL syntax. A simple fix has been released on the Main PCW site available directly at <a href="http://www.phpclanwebsite.com/index.php?page=downloads&func=browselist&par=1">http://www.phpclanwebsite.com/index.php?page=downloads&func=browselist&par=1</a>

Tech note: Filters id number (par) to contain numbers only.
