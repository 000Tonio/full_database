# CVE-2006-1716

- Published: 2006-04-11T23:02:00

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in inc/functions_post.php in MyBB (aka MyBulletinBoard) 1.10 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a JavaScript event in a BBCode img tag.  NOTE: the email vector is already covered by CVE-2006-1625, although it might stem from the same core issue. Successful exploitation requires that unauthenticated users are allowed to post new threads (not the default setting).

### CVSS Score: **5.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
