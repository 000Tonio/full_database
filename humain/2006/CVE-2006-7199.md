- Published: 2007-04-30T23:19:00

EMC RSA Security SiteKey allows remote attackers to display the correct image via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack in which an attacker-controlled server proxies authentication data to and from a legitimate SiteKey server.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the severity of the issue, stating that it is easier to monitor this attack than "attacks against static web pages."

### CVSS Score: **8.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
