Mozilla Firefox 1.5.0.2 and possibly other versions before 1.5.0.4, Netscape 8.1, 8.0.4, and 7.2, and K-Meleon 0.9.13 allows user-assisted remote attackers to open local files via a web page with an IMG element containing a SRC attribute with a non-image file:// URL, then tricking the user into selecting View Image for the broken image, as demonstrated using a .wma file to launch Windows Media Player, or by referencing an "alternate web page."
