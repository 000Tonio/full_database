Untrusted search path vulnerability in opcontrol in OProfile 0.9.1 and earlier allows local users to execute arbitrary commands via a modified PATH that references malicious (1) which or (2) dirname programs.  NOTE: while opcontrol normally is not run setuid, a common configuration suggests accessing opcontrol using sudo.  In such a context, this is a vulnerability.
