Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Jinzora Media Jukebox 2.7 and earlier, when register_globals is enabled, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the include_path parameter in (1) popup.php, (2) rss.php, (3) ajax_request.php, and (4) mediabroadcast.php. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
