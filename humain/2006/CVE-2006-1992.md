mshtml.dll 6.00.2900.2873, as used in Microsoft Internet Explorer, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via nested OBJECT tags, which trigger invalid pointer dereferences including NULL dereferences.  NOTE: the possibility of code execution was originally theorized, but Microsoft has stated that this issue is non-exploitable.
