IBM Tivoli Micromuse Netcool/NeuSecure 3.0.236 configures a MySQL database to allow connections from any source IP address with the ns database account, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Netcool/NeuSecure application layer and perform unauthorized database actions.  NOTE: IBM has privately confirmed to CVE that a fix is available for these issues.
