# CVE-2006-3850

** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in upgrader.php in Vanilla CMS 1.0.1 and earlier, when /conf/old_settings.php exists, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the RootDirectory parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a third party who states that the RootDirectory parameter is initialized before being used, for version 1.0.  CVE analysis concurs with the dispute, but it is unclear whether older versions are affected.
