# CVE-2006-1589

- Published: 2006-04-03T10:04:00

- Modified: 2017-07-20T01:30:00

The elf_load_file function in NetBSD 2.0 through 3.0 allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel crash) via an ELF interpreter that does not have a PT_LOAD section in its header, which triggers a null dereference. The NetBSD 2.x versions are only affected if the kernel is compiled with the USE_TOPDOWN_VM option (not default in generic kernels).

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
