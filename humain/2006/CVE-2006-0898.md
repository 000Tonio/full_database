- Published: 2006-02-25T11:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:29:00

Crypt::CBC Perl module 2.16 and earlier, when running in RandomIV mode, uses an initialization vector (IV) of 8 bytes, which results in weaker encryption when used with a cipher that requires a larger block size than 8 bytes, such as Rijndael.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
