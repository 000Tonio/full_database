# CVE-2006-3249

- Published: 2006-06-27T10:05:00

** DISPUTED **  SQL injection vulnerability in search.php in Phorum 5.1.14 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the page parameter.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this report, stating "If a non positive integer or non-integer is used for the page parameter for a search URL, the search query will use a negative number for the LIMIT clause. This causes the query to break, showing no results.  It IS NOT however a sql injection error."  While the original report is from a researcher with mixed accuracy, as of 20060703, CVE does not have any additional information regarding this issue.
