# CVE-2006-6254

- Published: 2006-12-04T11:28:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:47:00

administration/telecharger.php in Cahier de texte 2.0 allows remote attackers to obtain unparsed content (source code) of files via the chemin parameter, as demonstrated using directory traversal sequences to obtain the MySQL username and password from conn_cahier_de_texte.php.  NOTE: it is not clear whether the scope of this issue extends above the web document root, and whether directory traversal is the primary vulnerability. Successful exploitation requirs that "register_globals" is enabled.
