# CVE-2006-4257

- Published: 2006-08-21T20:04:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:34:00

IBM DB2 Universal Database (UDB) before 8.1 FixPak 13 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (crash) by (1) sending the first ACCSEC command without an RDBNAM parameter during the CONNECT process, or (2) sending crafted SQLJRA packet, which results in a null dereference.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
