Leif M. Wright's Blog 3.5 does not make a password comparison when authenticating an administrator via a cookie, which allows remote attackers to bypass login authentication, probably by setting the blogAdmin cookie.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
