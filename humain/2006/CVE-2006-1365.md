The Motorola PEBL U6, the Motorola V600, and possibly the Motorola E398 and other Motorola phones allow remote attackers to add an entry for their own Bluetooth device to a target device's list of trusted devices (aka Device History), and possibly obtain AT level access to the target device, by initiating and interrupting an OBEX Push Profile that pretends to send a vCard, aka a "HeloMoto" attack.
