ip_nat_pptp in the PPTP NAT helper (netfilter/ip_nat_helper_pptp.c) in Linux kernel 2.6.14, and other versions, allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) via a crafted outbound packet that causes an incorrect offset to be calculated from pointer arithmetic when non-linear SKBs (socket buffers) are used.
