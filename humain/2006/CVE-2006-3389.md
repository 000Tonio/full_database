index.php in WordPress 2.0.3 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information, such as SQL table prefixes, via an invalid paged parameter, which displays the information in an SQL error message.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a third party who states that the issue does not leak any target-specific information.
