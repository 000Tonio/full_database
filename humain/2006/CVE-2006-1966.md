# CVE-2006-1966

- Published: 2006-04-21T10:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:37:00

An unspecified Fortinet product, possibly Fortinet28, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a "small synflood" to the SMTP port (TCP port 25), as demonstrated by a 10-microsecond wait between sending packets.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed in followup posts that suggest that a protection feature is triggering a RST.
