# CVE-2006-6614

- Published: 2006-12-18T02:28:00

- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:29:00

The save_log_local function in Fully Automatic Installation (FAI) 2.10.1, and possibly 3.1.2, when verbose mode is enabled, stores the root password hash in /var/log/fai/current/fai.log, whose file permissions allow it to be copied to other hosts when fai-savelog is called and allows attackers to obtain the hash.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
