# CVE-2006-2827

- Published: 2006-06-05T17:02:00

** DISPUTED **  SQL injection vulnerability in search.php in X-Cart Gold and Pro 4.0.18, and X-Cart 4.1.0 beta 1, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the "Search for pattern" field, when the settings specify only "Search in Detailed description" and "Search also in ISBN."  NOTE: the vendor disputed this issue in a comment on the original researcher's blog, saying "the bug does not impose any security threat and remote attackers can't add, modify, or delete information in the back-end database by sending specially-crafted SQL statements to the search.php script using various search parameters." As of 20060605, the original blog entry is unavailable, although ISS also reports the same dispute.  CVE has not been able to investigate this issue further, although the researcher sometimes makes inaccurate claims.
