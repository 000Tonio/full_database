** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in common/visiteurs/include/library.inc.php in J-Pierre DEZELUS Les Visiteurs 2.0.1, as used in phpMyConferences (phpMyConference) 8.0.2 and possibly other products, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the lvc_modules_dir parameter.  NOTE: CVE disputes this vulnerability, because the inclusion occurs in a function that is not called during a direct request to library.inc.php.
