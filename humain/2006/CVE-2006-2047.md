Application Dynamics Cartweaver ColdFusion 2.16.11 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via an invalid (1) secondary, (2) PageNum_Results, (3) category, or (4) keywords parameter in (a) Results.cfm; or an invalid (5) ProdID parameter in (b) Details.cfm; which reveal the path in various error messages. NOTE: the behavior for the category, keywords, and ProdID parameters might be resultant from SQL injection.
