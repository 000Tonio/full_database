SQL injection vulnerability in CyBoards PHP Lite 1.25, when magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the parent parameter to (1) post.php and possibly (2) process_post.php. Successful exploitation requires that the "magic_quotes_gpc" parameter is disabled.
