# CVE-2006-2552

- Published: 2006-05-24T01:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:40:00

Jemscripts DownloadControl 1.0 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via an invalid dcid parameter to dc.php, which leaks the pathname in an error message.  NOTE: this was originally claimed to be SQL injection, but it is probably resultant from another issue in functions.php.

### CVSS Score: **5**
