Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Indexing Service in Microsoft Windows 2000, XP, and Server 2003, when the Encoding option is set to Auto Select, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a UTF-7 encoded URL, which is injected into an error message whose charset is set to UTF-7. Successful exploitation requires that the Indexing service is accessible through IIS.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
