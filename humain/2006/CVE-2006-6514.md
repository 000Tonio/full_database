# CVE-2006-6514

- Published: 2006-12-14T01:28:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:49:00

Winamp Web Interface (Wawi) 7.5.13 and earlier uses an insufficient comparison to determine whether a directory is located below the application's root directory, which allows remote authenticated users to access certain other directories if the name of the root directory is a substring of the name of the target directory, as demonstrated by accessing C:\folder2 when the root directory is C:\folder.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
