Directory traversal vulnerability in (1) initiate.php and (2) possibly other PHP scripts in Turnkey Web Tools PHP Live Helper 1.8, and possibly later versions, allows remote authenticated users to include and execute arbitrary local files via directory traversal sequences in the language cookie, as demonstrated by uploading PHP code in a gl_session cookie to users.php, which causes the code to be stored in error.log, which is then included by initiate.php. This vulnerability may affect all other versions of Turnkey Web Tools, PHP Live Helper.
