Buffer overflow in the png_decompress_chunk function in pngrutil.c in libpng before 1.2.12 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors related to "chunk error processing," possibly involving the "chunk_name". Upgrade to 1.2.12
