VMWare VirtualCenter client 2.x before 2.0.1 Patch 1 (Build 33643) and 1.4.x before 1.4.1 Patch 1 (Build 33425), when server certificate verification is enabled, does not verify the server's X.509 certificate when creating an SSL session, which allows remote malicious servers to spoof valid servers via a man-in-the-middle attack.
