# CVE-2006-3610

- Published: 2006-07-18T15:46:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:48:00

index.php in Orbitcoders OrbitMATRIX 1.0 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (partial database schema) via a modified page_name parameter, which reflects portions of an SQL query in the result.  NOTE: it is not clear whether the information is target-specific. If not, then this issue is not an exposure.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
