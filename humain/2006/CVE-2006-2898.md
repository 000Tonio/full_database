# CVE-2006-2898

- Published: 2006-06-07T10:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:43:00

The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) for Asterisk 1.2.x before 1.2.9 and 1.0.x before 1.0.11 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and execute arbitrary code via truncated IAX 2 (IAX2) video frames, which bypasses a length check and leads to a buffer overflow involving negative length check.  NOTE: the vendor advisory claims that only a DoS is possible, but the original researcher is reliable. This vulnerability is addressed in the following product releases:
Asterisk, Asterisk, 1.2.9 
Asterisk, Asterisk, 1.0.11
