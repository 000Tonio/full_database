# CVE-2006-3468

- Published: 2006-07-21T14:03:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:26:00

Linux kernel 2.6.x, when using both NFS and EXT3, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (file system panic) via a crafted UDP packet with a V2 lookup procedure that specifies a bad file handle (inode number), which triggers an error and causes an exported directory to be remounted read-only.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
