# CVE-2006-5558

- Published: 2006-10-27T16:07:00

Format string vulnerability in the swask command in HP-UX B.11.11 and possibly other versions allows local users to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the -s argument.  NOTE: this might be a duplicate of CVE-2006-2574, but the details relating to CVE-2006-2574 are too vague to be certain.
