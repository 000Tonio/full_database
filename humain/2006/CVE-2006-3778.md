# CVE-2006-3778

- Published: 2006-07-24T12:19:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T21:08:00

IBM Lotus Notes 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0 does not properly handle replies to e-mail messages with alternate name users when the (1) "Save As Draft" option is used or (2) a "," (comma) is inside the "phrase" portion of an address, which can cause the e-mail to be sent to users that were deleted from the To, CC, and BCC fields, which allows remote attackers to obtain the list of original recipients.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
