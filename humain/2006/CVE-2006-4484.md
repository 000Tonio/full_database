# CVE-2006-4484

- Published: 2006-08-31T21:04:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:25:00

Buffer overflow in the LWZReadByte_ function in ext/gd/libgd/gd_gif_in.c in the GD extension in PHP before 5.1.5 allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact via a GIF file with input_code_size greater than MAX_LWZ_BITS, which triggers an overflow when initializing the table array.
