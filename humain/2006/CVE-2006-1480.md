Directory traversal vulnerability in start.php in WebAlbum 2.02 allows remote attackers to include arbitrary files and execute commands by (1) injecting code into local log files via GET commands, then (2) accessing that log via a .. (dot dot) sequence and a trailing null (%00) byte in the skin2 COOKIE parameter. Successful exploitation requires that the "magic_quotes_gpc" parameter is disabled.
