Apple QuickTime 7.1.3 Player and Plug-In allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code and possibly conduct other attacks via a QuickTime Media Link (QTL) file with an embed XML element and a qtnext parameter that identifies resources outside of the original domain.  NOTE: as of 20070912, this issue has been demonstrated by using instances of Components.interfaces.nsILocalFile and Components.interfaces.nsIProcess to execute arbitrary local files within Firefox and possibly Internet Explorer.
