# CVE-2006-0633

- Published: 2006-02-10T11:02:00

- Modified: 2013-01-03T05:00:00

The make_password function in ipsclass.php in Invision Power Board (IPB) 2.1.4 uses random data generated from partially predictable seeds to create the authentication code that is sent by e-mail to a user with a lost password, which might make it easier for remote attackers to guess the code and change the password for an IPB account, possibly involving millions of requests.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
