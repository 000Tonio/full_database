# CVE-2006-6424

- Published: 2006-12-27T01:28:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:48:00

Multiple buffer overflows in Novell NetMail before 3.52e FTF2 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code (1) by appending literals to certain IMAP verbs when specifying command continuation requests to IMAPD, resulting in a heap overflow; and (2) via crafted arguments to the STOR command to the Network Messaging Application Protocol (NMAP) daemon, resulting in a stack overflow. Successful exploitation requires a valid user account.
This vulnerability is addressed in the following product update:
Novell, NetMail, 3.52e FTF2
