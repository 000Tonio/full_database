Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in install.php in CPG-Nuke Dragonfly CMS (aka CPG Dragonfly CMS) 9.0.6.1 allow remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via directory traversal sequences and a NUL (%00) character in (1) the newlang parameter and (2) the installlang parameter in a cookie, as demonstrated by using error.php to insert malicious code into a log file, or uploading a malicious .png file, which is then included using install.php.
