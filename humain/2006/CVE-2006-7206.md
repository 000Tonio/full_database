# CVE-2006-7206

- Published: 2007-06-22T00:30:00

Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 on Windows XP SP2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) by creating a ADODB.Recordset object and making a series of calls to the NextRecordset method with a long string argument, which causes an "invalid memory access" in the SysFreeString function, a different issue than CVE-2006-3510 and CVE-2006-3899.
