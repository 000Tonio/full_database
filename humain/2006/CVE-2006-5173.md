# CVE-2006-5173

- Published: 2006-10-17T22:07:00

- Modified: 2020-08-19T19:42:00

Linux kernel does not properly save or restore EFLAGS during a context switch, or reset the flags when creating new threads, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (process crash), as demonstrated using a process that sets the Alignment Check flag (EFLAGS 0x40000), which triggers a SIGBUS in other processes that have an unaligned access.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
