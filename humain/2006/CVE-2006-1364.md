# CVE-2006-1364

- Published: 2006-03-23T11:06:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:32:00

Microsoft w3wp (aka w3wp.exe) does not properly handle when the AspCompat directive is not used when referencing COM components in ASP.NET, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption or crash) by repeatedly requesting each of several documents that refer to COM components, or are restricted documents located under the ASP.NET application path.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
