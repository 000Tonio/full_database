# CVE-2006-1116

- Published: 2006-03-09T13:06:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:30:00

The CBC-MAC integrity functions in the nCipher nCore API before 2.18 transmit the initialization vector IV as part of a message when the implementation uses a non-zero IV, which allows remote attackers to bypass integrity checks and modify messages without being detected.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
