** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in ToendaCMS 1.0.3 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the tcms_administer_site parameter to an unspecified script, probably index.php.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by a third party, who states that $tcms_administer_site is initialized to a constant value within index.php.
