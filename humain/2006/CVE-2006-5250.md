PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in lib/googlesearch/GoogleSearch.php in BlueShoes 4.6_public and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the APP[path][lib] parameter, a different vector than CVE-2006-2864. The following conditions must be met in order for this vulnerability to be exploited:
1) BlueShoes is installed in the webroot (really not recommended, see installation manual 
2) register_globals is on (really really not recommended, off by default since php 4.2.0, read http://www.php.net/register_globals 
3) allow_url_fopen is on (on by default, often set to off by hosting providers)
