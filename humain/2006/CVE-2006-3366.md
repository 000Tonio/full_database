Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in V3 Chat allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via crafted HTML tags, as demonstrated by the IMG tag, in the (1) id parameter in (a) mail/index.php and (b) mail/reply.php; (2) login_id parameter in (c) members/is_online.php; (3) site_id parameter in (d) messenger/online.php, (e) messenger/search.php, and (f) messenger/profile.php; (4) contact_name parameter in messenger/search.php; (5) membername parameter in (g) messenger/profileview.php; (6) unspecified parameters used when "editing a profile"; and (7) cust_name parameter in (h) messenger/expire.php.  NOTE: The vendor disputes the vectors involving files in the messenger directory, stating "... the referenced folder 'messenger' was never available to the general public...".
