flex.skl in Will Estes and John Millaway Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator (flex) before 2.5.33 does not allocate enough memory for grammars containing (1) REJECT statements or (2) trailing context rules, which causes flex to generate code that contains a buffer overflow that might allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code.
