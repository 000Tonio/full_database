Unspecified vulnerability in index.php in Warcraft III Replay Parser for PHP 1.8c allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the page parameter, possibly related to fopen function calls or file uploads.  NOTE: post-disclosure analysis by CVE suggests that the "page" parameter is not used in this product, and "id" might be the affected parameter.
