WebEx Downloader ActiveX Control and WebEx Downloader Java before 2.1.0.0 do not validate downloaded components, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a website that activates the GpcUrlRoot and GpcIniFileName ActiveX controls to cause the client to download a DLL file. Upgrade to version 2.1.0.0.
