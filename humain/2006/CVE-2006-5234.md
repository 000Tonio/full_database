** DISPUTED **  Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in phpWebSite 0.10.2 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the PHPWS_SOURCE_DIR parameter in (1) init.php, (2) users.php, (3) Cookie.php, (4) forms.php, (5) Groups.php, (6) ModSetting.php, (7) Calendar.php, (8) DateTime.php, (9) core.php, (10) ImgLibrary.php, (11) Manager.php, and (12) Template.php, and (13) EZform.php.  NOTE: CVE disputes this report, since "PHPWS_SOURCE_DIR" is defined as a constant, not accessed as a variable.
