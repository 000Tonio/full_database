# CVE-2006-0070

** DISPUTED **  Drupal allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via an IMG tag with an unusual encoded Javascript function name, as demonstrated using variations of the alert() function.  NOTE: a followup by the vendor suggests that the issue does not exist in 4.5.6 or 4.6.4 when "Filtered HTML" is enabled, and since "Full HTML" would not filter HTML by design, perhaps this should not be included in CVE.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
