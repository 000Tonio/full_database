# CVE-2006-5466

- Published: 2006-11-06T17:07:00

- Modified: 2011-03-08T02:43:00

Heap-based buffer overflow in the showQueryPackage function in librpm in RPM Package Manager 4.4.8, when the LANG environment variable is set to ru_RU.UTF-8, might allow user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted RPM packages. Successful exploitation may allow the execution of arbitrary code, but requires that certain locales are set (e.g. ru_RU.UTF-8).
There are patches available for each affected Ubuntu product.
