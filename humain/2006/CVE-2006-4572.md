ip6_tables in netfilter in the Linux kernel before 2.6.16.31 allows remote attackers to (1) bypass a rule that disallows a protocol, via a packet with the protocol header not located immediately after the fragment header, aka "ip6_tables protocol bypass bug;" and (2) bypass a rule that looks for a certain extension header, via a packet with an extension header outside the first fragment, aka "ip6_tables extension header bypass bug."
