Internet Explorer 6 on Windows XP SP2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the browser's session with an arbitrary intranet web server, by hosting script on an Internet web server that can be made inaccessible by the attacker and that has a domain name under the attacker's control, which can force the browser to drop DNS pinning and perform a new DNS query for the domain name after the script is already running.
