Mozilla Firefox 1.5 before 1.5.0.2 and SeaMonkey before 1.0.1 causes certain windows to become translucent due to an interaction between XUL content windows and the history mechanism, which might allow user-assisted remote attackers to trick users into executing arbitrary code. Fixed in: 
  Firefox 1.5.0.2
  SeaMonkey 1.0.1
