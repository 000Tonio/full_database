** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in libs/Smarty.class.php in Smarty 2.6.9 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the filename parameter.  NOTE: in the original disclosure, filename is used in a function definition, so this report is probably incorrect.
