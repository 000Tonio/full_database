** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in common.php in PHORUM 5.1.13 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the PHORUM[http_path] parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor, who states "common.php is checked on the very first line of non-comment code that it is not being called directly. It has been this way in all 5.x version of Phorum."  CVE analysis concurs with the vendor.
