Coppermine Photo Gallery (CPG) 1.4.8 stable, with register_globals enabled, allows remote attackers to bypass XSS protection and set arbitrary variables via a query string that causes the variable to be defined in global space, with separate _GET, _REQUEST, or other critical parameters, which are unset by the protection scheme and prevent the original variable from being detected.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
