# CVE-2006-6169

- Published: 2006-11-29T18:28:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:47:00

Heap-based buffer overflow in the ask_outfile_name function in openfile.c for GnuPG (gpg) 1.4 and 2.0, when running interactively, might allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via messages with "C-escape" expansions, which cause the make_printable_string function to return a longer string than expected while constructing a prompt.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
