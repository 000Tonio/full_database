# CVE-2006-0145

- Published: 2006-01-09T23:03:00

The kernfs_xread function in kernfs in NetBSD 1.6 through 2.1, and OpenBSD 3.8, does not properly validate file offsets against negative 32-bit values that occur as a result of truncation, which allows local users to read arbitrary kernel memory and gain privileges via the lseek system call.
