Multiple buffer overflows in Sophos Anti-Virus scanning engine before 2.40 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a SIT archive with a long filename that is not null-terminated, which triggers a heap-based overflow in veex.dll due to improper length calculation, and (2) a CPIO archive, with a long filename that is not null-terminated, which triggers a stack-based overflow in veex.dll.

### CVSS Score: **10**
