Mercury Messenger, possibly 1.7.1.1 and other versions, when running on a multi-user Mac OS X platform, stores chat logs with world-readable permissions within the /Users directory, which allows local users to read the chat logs from other users. Successful exploitation requires that the environment is a multi-user Mac OS X platform.
