# CVE-2006-4782

- Published: 2006-09-14T10:07:00

- Modified: 2017-10-19T01:29:00

src/index.php in WebSPELL 4.01.01 and earlier, when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and gain sensitive information stored in the database via a modified userID parameter in a write action to admin/database.php. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

### CVSS Score: **5.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
