** DISPUTED **  The proxy DNS service in Symantec Gateway Security (SGS) allows remote attackers to make arbitrary DNS queries to third-party DNS servers, while hiding the source IP address of the attacker.  NOTE: another researcher has stated that the default configuration does not proxy DNS queries received on the external interface.
