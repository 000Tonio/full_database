# CVE-2006-0922

- Published: 2006-02-28T11:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:29:00

CubeCart 3.0 through 3.6 does not properly check authorization for an administration session because of a missing auth.inc.php include, which results in an absolute path traversal vulnerability in FileUpload in connector.php (aka upload.php) that allows remote attackers to upload arbitrary files via a modified CurrentFolder parameter in a direct request to admin/filemanager/upload.php.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
