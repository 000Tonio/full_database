# CVE-2006-5557

- Published: 2006-10-27T16:07:00

- Modified: 2017-10-19T01:29:00

Stack-based buffer overflow in the (1) swpackage and (2) swmodify commands in HP-UX B.11.11 and possibly other versions allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a long -S argument.  NOTE: this might be a duplicate of CVE-2006-2574, but the details relating to CVE-2006-2574 are too vague to be certain.
