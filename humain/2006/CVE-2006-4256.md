- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:34:00

index.php in Horde Application Framework before 3.1.2 allows remote attackers to include web pages from other sites, which could be useful for phishing attacks, via a URL in the url parameter, aka "cross-site referencing." NOTE: some sources have referred to this issue as XSS, but it is different than classic XSS.
