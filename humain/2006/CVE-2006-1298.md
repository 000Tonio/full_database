Format string vulnerability in the Job Engine service (bengine.exe) in the Media Server in Veritas Backup Exec 10d (10.1) for Windows Servers rev. 5629, Backup Exec 10.0 for Windows Servers rev. 5520, Backup Exec 10.0 for Windows Servers rev. 5484, and Backup Exec 9.1 for Windows Servers rev. 4691, when the job log mode is Full Detailed (aka Full Details), allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted filename on a machine that is backed up by Backup Exec. This vulnerability can only be exploited if the 'job log' mode is set to "Full Detailed" (aka Full Details).  Other older versions of Windows Server (those that have been End-Of-Life'd) should be upgraded to the latest patch of one of the current versions listed above.
