# CVE-2006-3697

- Published: 2006-07-21T14:03:00

Agnitum Outpost Firewall Pro 3.51.759.6511 (462), as used in (1) Lavasoft Personal Firewall 1.0.543.5722 (433) and (2) Novell BorderManager Novell Client Firewall 2.0, does not properly restrict user activities in application windows that run in a LocalSystem context, which allows local users to gain privileges and execute commands (a) via the "open folder" option when no instance of explorer.exe is running, possibly related to the ShellExecute API function; or (b) by overwriting a batch file through the "Save Configuration As" option. NOTE: this might be a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows and explorer.exe instead of the firewall.
