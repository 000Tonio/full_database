Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Epicdesigns tinyBB 0.3 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) q parameter in (a) forgot.php, and the (2) username and (3) password parameters in (b) login.php, and other unspecified vectors. Successful exploitation requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.
