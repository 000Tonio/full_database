# CVE-2006-3940

- Published: 2006-07-31T22:04:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:32:00

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in phpbb-Auction allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via (1) the ar parameter in auction_room.php and (2) the u parameter in auction_store.php. NOTE: the auction_rating.php vector is already covered by CVE-2005-1234.  NOTE: the original disclosure states that the product name is "PHP-Auction", but this is probably an error.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
