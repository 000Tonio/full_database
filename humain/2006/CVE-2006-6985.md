Cross-domain vulnerability in Maxthon 1.5.6 build 42 allows remote attackers to access restricted information from other domains via an object tag with a data parameter that references a link on the attacker's originating site that specifies a Location HTTP header that references the target site, which then makes that content available through the outerHTML attribute of the object, a similar vulnerability to CVE-2006-3280.
