# CVE-2006-2480

- Published: 2006-05-19T21:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-03T21:41:00

Format string vulnerability in Dia 0.94 allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by triggering errors or warnings, as demonstrated via format string specifiers in a .bmp filename.  NOTE: the original exploit was demonstrated through a command line argument, but there are other mechanisms for input that are automatically processed by Dia, such as a crafted .dia file.
