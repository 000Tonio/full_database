# CVE-2006-1642

- Published: 2006-04-06T10:04:00

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Interact 2.1.1 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the search_terms parameter to (a) search.php, and (2) the first_name, (3) last_name, (4) email, (5) password, and (6) confirm_password parameters to (b) userinput.php.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained from third party.  In addition, the lack of precision in the third party descriptions makes it unclear whether the named vectors are correct.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
