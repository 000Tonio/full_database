include.php in Shoutpro 1.0 might allow remote attackers to bypass IP ban restrictions via a URL in the path parameter that points to an alternate bannedips.php file.  NOTE: this issue was originally reported as remote file inclusion, but CVE analysis suggests that this cannot be used for code execution.
