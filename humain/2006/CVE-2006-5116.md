Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in phpMyAdmin before 2.9.1-rc1 allow remote attackers to perform unauthorized actions as another user by (1) directly setting a token in the URL though dynamic variable evaluation and (2) unsetting arbitrary variables via the _REQUEST array, related to (a) libraries/common.lib.php, (b) session.inc.php, and (c) url_generating.lib.php.  NOTE: the PHP unset function vector is covered by CVE-2006-3017.
