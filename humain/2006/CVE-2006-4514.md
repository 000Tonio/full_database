# CVE-2006-4514

- Published: 2006-11-30T23:28:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:37:00

Heap-based buffer overflow in the ole_info_read_metabat function in Gnome Structured File library (libgsf) 1.14.0, and other versions before 1.14.2, allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a large num_metabat value in an OLE document, which causes the ole_init_info function to allocate insufficient memory.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
