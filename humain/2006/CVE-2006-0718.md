The Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) implementation in Avaya VSU 100, 2000, 7500, 10000, and CSU 5000, when running IPSec, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via certain IKE packets, as demonstrated by the PROTOS ISAKMP Test Suite for IKEv1. NOTE: due to the lack of details in the advisory, it is unclear which of CVE-2005-3666, CVE-2005-3667, and/or CVE-2005-3668 this issue applies to.
