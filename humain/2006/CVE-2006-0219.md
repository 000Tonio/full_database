The original distribution of MyBulletinBoard (MyBB) to update from older versions to 1.0.2 omits or includes older versions of certain critical files, which allows attackers to conduct (1) SQL injection attacks via an attachment name that is not properly handled by inc/functions_upload.php (CVE-2005-4602), and possibly (2) other attacks related to threadmode in usercp.php.
