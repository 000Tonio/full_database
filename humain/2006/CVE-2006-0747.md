# CVE-2006-0747

- Published: 2006-05-23T10:06:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:46:00

Integer underflow in Freetype before 2.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a font file with an odd number of blue values, which causes the underflow when decrementing by 2 in a context that assumes an even number of values.

### CVSS Score: **5**
