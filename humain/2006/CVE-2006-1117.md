nCipher firmware before V10, as used by (1) nShield, (2) nForce, (3) netHSM, (4) payShield, (5) SecureDB, (6) DSE200 Document Sealing Engine, (7) Time Source Master Clock (TSMC), and possibly other products, contains certain options that were only intended for testing and not production, which might allow remote attackers to obtain information about encryption keys and crack those keys with less effort than brute force.
