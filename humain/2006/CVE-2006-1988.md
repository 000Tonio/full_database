# CVE-2006-1988

- Published: 2006-04-21T22:02:00

- Modified: 2017-07-20T01:31:00

The WebTextRenderer(WebInternal) _CG_drawRun:style:geometry: function in Apple Safari 2.0.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via an HTML LI tag with a large VALUE attribute (list item number), which triggers a null dereference in QPainter::drawText, probably due to a failed memory allocation that uses the VALUE.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| --- | --- | --- |
