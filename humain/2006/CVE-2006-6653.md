- Published: 2006-12-20T02:28:00

The accept function in NetBSD-current before 20061023, NetBSD 3.0 and 3.0.1 before 20061024, and NetBSD 2.x before 20061029 allows local users to cause a denial of service (socket consumption) via an invalid (1) name or (2) namelen parameter, which may result in the socket never being closed (aka "a dangling socket"). This vulnerability is addressed in the following product updates:
NetBSD, NetBSD, current (10/23/2006)
NetBSD, NetBSD, 3.0 (10/24/2006)
NetBSD, NetBSD, 3.0.1 (10/24/2006) 
NetBSD, NetBSD, 2.0 (10/29/2006)
