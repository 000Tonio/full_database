Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the 500 Internal Server Error page on the SOAP port (8880/tcp) in IBM WebSphere Application Server 5.0.2 and earlier, 5.1.x before 5.1.1.12, and 6.0.2 up to 6.0.2.7, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the URI, which is contained in a FAULTACTOR element on this page.  NOTE: some sources have reported the element as "faultfactor," but this is likely erroneous.
