# CVE-2006-7216

- Published: 2007-07-05T20:30:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T21:16:00

Apache Derby before 10.2.1.6 does not determine privilege requirements for lock table statements at compilation time, and consequently does not enforce privilege requirements at execution time, which allows remote authenticated users to lock arbitrary tables.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
