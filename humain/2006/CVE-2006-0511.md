** DISPUTED ** Blackboard Academic Suite 6.0 and earlier does not properly clear session information when de-authenticating a user who is idle, which allows subsequent users to log in as the previous user and gain privileges.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, saying that "This is a customer specific issue related to their Kerberos authentication single sign-on application and not a vulnerability in the Blackboard product."

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
