BomberClone 0.11.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via (1) a certain malformed PKGF_ackreq packet, which triggers a crash in the rscache_add() function in pkgcache.c; and (2) an error packet, which is intended to be received by clients and force client shutdown, but also triggers server shutdown.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
