** DISPUTED **  Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in ISPConfig 2.2.3 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the (1) go_info[isp][classes_root] parameter in (a) server.inc.php, and the (2) go_info[server][classes_root] parameter in (b) app.inc.php, (c) login.php, and (d) trylogin.php.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor, who states that the original researcher "reviewed the installation tarball that is not identical with the resulting system after installtion.  The file, where the $go_info array is declared ... is created by the installer."
