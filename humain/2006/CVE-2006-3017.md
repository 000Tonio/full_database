# CVE-2006-3017

- Published: 2006-06-14T23:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:25:00

zend_hash_del_key_or_index in zend_hash.c in PHP before 4.4.3 and 5.x before 5.1.3 can cause zend_hash_del to delete the wrong element, which prevents a variable from being unset even when the PHP unset function is called, which might cause the variable's value to be used in security-relevant operations.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**
