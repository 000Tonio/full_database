The enet_protocol_handle_send_fragment function in protocol.c for ENet library CVS version Jul 2005 and earlier, as used in products including (1) Cube, (2) Sauerbraten, and (3) Duke3d_w32, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a packet fragment with a large total data size, which triggers an application abort when memory allocation fails.

### CVSS Score: **5**
