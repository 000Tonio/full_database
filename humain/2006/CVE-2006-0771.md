Format string vulnerability in PunkBuster 1.180 and earlier, as used by Soldier of Fortune II and possibly other games, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (server crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in invalid cvar values, which are not properly handled when the server kicks the player and records the reason.
