admin/options.php in Extreme CMS 0.9, and possibly earlier, does not require authentication, which might allow remote attackers to conduct unauthorized activities.  NOTE: this issue can be combined with another vulnerability to expand the scope of a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack without authentication.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown; details are obtained from third party sources.
