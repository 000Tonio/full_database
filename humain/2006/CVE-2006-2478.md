# CVE-2006-2478

- Published: 2006-05-19T17:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:40:00

Bitrix Site Manager 4.1.x allows remote attackers to redirect users to other websites via a modified back_url during a HTTP POST request. NOTE: this issue has been referred to as "cross-site scripting," but that is inconsistent with the common use of the term.

### CVSS Score: **5**
