# CVE-2006-2220

- Published: 2007-02-08T17:28:00

- Modified: 2017-07-20T01:31:00

phpBB 2.0.20 does not properly verify user-specified input variables used as limits to SQL queries, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a negative LIMIT specification, as demonstrated by the start parameter to memberlist.php, which reveals the SQL query in the resulting error message.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
