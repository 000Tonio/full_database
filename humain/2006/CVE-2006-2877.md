# CVE-2006-2877

- Published: 2006-06-07T00:02:00

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in Bookmark4U 2.0.0 and earlier allows remote attackers to include arbitrary PHP files via the include_prefix parameter in (1) inc/dbase.php, (2) inc/config.php, (3) inc/common.php, and (4) inc/function.php.  NOTE: it has been reported that the inc directory is protected by a .htaccess file, so this issue only applies in certain environments or configurations.
