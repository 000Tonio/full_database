Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in EZOnlineGallery 1.3 and earlier, and possibly other versions before 1.3.2 Beta, allow remote attackers to (1) determine directory existence via a ".." in the album parameter in a show_album action to (a) ezgallery.php, which produces different responses depending on existence; and read arbitrary image files via a ".." in the album or (2) image parameter to (b) image.php.
