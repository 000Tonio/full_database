Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in newthread.php in MyBB (aka MyBulletinBoard) 1.10, when configured to permit new threads by unregistered users, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the username. Successful exploitation requires that unauthenticated users are allowed to post new threads (not the default setting).

### CVSS Score: **5.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
