Buffer overflow in Unicode processing in the logging functionality in Pablo Software Solutions Quick 'n Easy FTP Server Professional and Lite, probably 3.0, allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code by sending a command with a long argument, which triggers a buffer overflow when an admin selects the Logging section in the FTP server main window.  NOTE: the original researcher claims that the vendor disputes this issue.
