Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Security Images (com_securityimages) component 3.0.5 and earlier for Joomla! allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a URL in the mosConfig_absolute_path parameter in (1) configinsert.php, (2) lang.php, (3) client.php, and (4) server.php. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
