Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Apache Geronimo 1.0 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) time parameter to cal2.jsp and (2) any invalid parameter, which causes an XSS when the log file is viewed by the Web-Access-Log viewer.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
