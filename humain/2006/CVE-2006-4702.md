Buffer overflow in the Windows Media Format Runtime in Microsoft Windows Media Player (WMP) 6.4 and Windows XP SP2, Server 2003, and Server 2003 SP1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted Advanced Systems Format (ASF) file. An attacker who successfully exploited these vulnerabilities could gain the same user rights as the local user.  If the end user has administrative rights, the attacker could take complete control of the affected system.
