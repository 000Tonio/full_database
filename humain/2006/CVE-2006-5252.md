PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in includes/core.lib.php in Webmedia Explorer 2.8.7 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the path_include parameter. Successful exploitation requires that the application is incorrectly configured.  To resolve, activate mod_rewrite and ensure that your web server processes the ".htaccess" file correctly.
