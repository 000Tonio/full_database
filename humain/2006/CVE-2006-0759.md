# CVE-2006-0759

- Published: 2006-02-18T02:02:00

- Modified: 2017-07-20T01:30:00

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in HiveMail 1.3 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via (1) the contactgroupid parameter in addressbook.update.php, (2) the messageid parameter in addressbook.add.php, (3) the folderid parameter in folders.update.php, and possibly certain parameters in (4) calendar.event.php, (5) index.php, (6) pop.download.php, (7) read.bounce.php, (8) rules.block.php, (9) language.php, and (10) certain other scripts; and allow remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via (11) the folderid parameter in index.php and (12) possibly other parameters in certain other scripts, because $_SERVER['PHP_SELF'] is improperly handled.
