TWiki 4.0, 4.0.1, and 20010901 through 20040904 allows remote authenticated users with edit rights to cause a denial of service (infinite recursion leading to CPU and memory consumption) via INCLUDE by URL statements that form a loop, such as a page that includes itself.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
