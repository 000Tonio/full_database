debconf in Debian GNU/Linux, when configuring mnogosearch in the mnogosearch-common 3.2.31-1 package, uses the world-readable config.dat file instead of the restricted passwords.dat for storing the cleartext database administrator password in the mnogosearch-common/database_admin_pass record, which allows local users to view the password.
