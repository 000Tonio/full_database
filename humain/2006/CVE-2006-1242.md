# CVE-2006-1242

- Published: 2006-03-15T17:06:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:31:00

The ip_push_pending_frames function in Linux 2.4.x and 2.6.x before 2.6.16 increments the IP ID field when sending a RST after receiving unsolicited TCP SYN-ACK packets, which allows remote attackers to conduct an Idle Scan (nmap -sI) attack, which bypasses intended protections against such attacks.

### CVSS Score: **5**
