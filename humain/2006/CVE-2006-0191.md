Unspecified vulnerability in Sun Solaris 10 allows local users to cause a denial of service (null dereference) via unspecified vectors involving the use of the find command on the "/proc" filesystem. NOTE: due to the vagueness of the vendor advisory, it is not clear whether this is related to CVE-2005-3250.
