# CVE-2006-5174

- Published: 2006-10-10T04:06:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:26:00

The copy_from_user function in the uaccess code in Linux kernel 2.6 before 2.6.19-rc1, when running on s390, does not properly clear a kernel buffer, which allows local user space programs to read portions of kernel memory by "appending to a file from a bad address," which triggers a fault that prevents the unused memory from being cleared in the kernel buffer. This vulnerability is addressed in the following product update:
Linux, Linux kernel, 2.6.19 rc1
