Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Helm Web Hosting Control Panel 3.2.10 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) txtDomainName parameter to domains.asp or (2) SearchText or (3) UserLevel parameters to default.asp. These issues are reportedly fixed by the vendor. Version 3.2.10-stable will contain these fixes when it is released. Contact the vendor for further information on obtaining fixes.
