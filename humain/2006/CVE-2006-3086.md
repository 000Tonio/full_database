# CVE-2006-3086

- Published: 2006-06-19T19:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:45:00

Stack-based buffer overflow in the HrShellOpenWithMonikerDisplayName function in Microsoft Hyperlink Object Library (hlink.dll) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long hyperlink, as demonstrated using an Excel worksheet with a long link in Unicode, aka "Hyperlink COM Object Buffer Overflow Vulnerability." NOTE: this is a different issue than CVE-2006-3059.
