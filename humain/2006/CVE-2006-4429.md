** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in handlers/email/mod.output.php in PHlyMail Lite 3.4.4 and earlier (Build 3.04.04) allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the _PM_[path][handler] parameter, a different vector than CVE-2006-4291.  NOTE: This issue has been disputed by a third party, who states that the _IN_PHM_ declaration prevents this file from being called directly.
