# CVE-2006-1490

- Published: 2006-03-29T21:06:00

PHP before 5.1.3-RC1 might allow remote attackers to obtain portions of memory via crafted binary data sent to a script that processes user input in the html_entity_decode function and sends the encoded results back to the client, aka a "binary safety" issue. NOTE: this issue has been referred to as a "memory leak," but it is an information leak that discloses memory contents.

### CVSS Score: **5**
