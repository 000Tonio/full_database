# CVE-2006-0992

- Published: 2006-04-14T10:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:30:00

Stack-based buffer overflow in Novell GroupWise Messenger before 2.0 Public Beta 2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long Accept-Language value without a comma or semicolon.  NOTE: due to a typo, the original ZDI advisory accidentally referenced CVE-2006-0092.  This is the correct identifier. Upgrade to GroupWise Messenger, 2.0 Public Beta 2 to fix this issue.
