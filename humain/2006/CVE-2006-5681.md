QuickTime for Java on Mac OS X 10.4 through 10.4.8, when used with Quartz Composer, allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (screen images) via a Java applet that accesses images that are being rendered by other embedded QuickTime objects. Successful exploitation requires that the affected products are used in conjunction with Quartz Composer.
