Firefox 1.5.0.1 allows remote attackers to spoof the address bar and possibly conduct phishing attacks by re-opening the window to a malicious Shockwave Flash application, then changing the window location back to a trusted URL while the Flash application is still loading.  NOTE: a followup was unable to replicate this issue.
