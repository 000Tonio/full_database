# CVE-2006-5815

- Published: 2006-11-08T23:07:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:45:00

Stack-based buffer overflow in the sreplace function in ProFTPD 1.3.0 and earlier allows remote attackers, probably authenticated, to cause a denial of service and execute arbitrary code, as demonstrated by vd_proftpd.pm, a "ProFTPD remote exploit." An off-by-one string manipulation flaw in ProFTPD's sreplace() function exists allowing a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code.
