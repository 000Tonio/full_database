- Published: 2006-08-29T00:04:00

- Modified: 2017-07-20T01:33:00

isakmpd in OpenBSD 3.8, 3.9, and possibly earlier versions, creates Security Associations (SA) with a replay window of size 0 when isakmpd acts as a responder during SA negotiation, which allows remote attackers to replay IPSec packets and bypass the replay protection.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
