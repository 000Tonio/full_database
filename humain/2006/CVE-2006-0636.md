desktop.php in eyeOS 0.8.9 and earlier tests for the existence of the _SESSION variable before calling the session_start function, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code and possibly conduct other attacks by modifying critical assumed-immutable variables, as demonstrated using PHP code in the _SESSION[apps][eyeOptions.eyeapp][wrapup] variable.
