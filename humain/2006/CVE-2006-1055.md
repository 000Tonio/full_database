- Published: 2006-04-05T17:04:00

- Modified: 2018-10-03T21:36:00

The fill_write_buffer function in sysfs/file.c in Linux kernel 2.6.12 up to versions before 2.6.17-rc1 does not zero terminate a buffer when a length of PAGE_SIZE or more is requested, which might allow local users to cause a denial of service (crash) by causing an out-of-bounds read.
