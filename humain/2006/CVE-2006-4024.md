# CVE-2006-4024

- Published: 2006-08-09T00:04:00

The FESTAHES_Load function in pce/hes.c in Festalon 0.5.0 through 0.5.5 allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a negative LoadAddr value in a HES file, which is used as an offset in a memcpy operation and leads to a buffer underflow.
