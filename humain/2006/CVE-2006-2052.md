Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Verosky Media Instant Photo Gallery allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the member parameter in a viewpro action in member.php. NOTE: the original report may be inaccurate, since the "viewpro" string does not appear in the source code for version 1.0.2 of the product.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**
