Adobe ColdFusion MX 7.x before 7.0.2 does not properly filter HTML tags when protecting against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, which allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a NULL byte (%00) in certain HTML tags, as demonstrated using "%00script" in a tag. Successful exploitation requires that the target uses Microsoft Internet Explorer.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
