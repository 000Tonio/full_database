# CVE-2006-1652

- Published: 2006-04-06T10:04:00

Multiple buffer overflows in (a) UltraVNC (aka Ultr@VNC) 1.0.1 and earlier and (b) tabbed_viewer 1.29 (1) allow user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a malicious server that sends a long string to a client that connects on TCP port 5900, which triggers an overflow in Log::ReallyPrint; and (2) allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (server crash) via a long HTTP GET request to TCP port 5800, which triggers an overflow in VNCLog::ReallyPrint. There are two seperate vulnerabilities here;  One allows escalated priveleges to authenticated users, the other allows remote unauthenticated users to cause a Denial of Service (DoS).
