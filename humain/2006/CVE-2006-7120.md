** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in lib/php/phphtmllib-2.5.4/examples/example6.php for maintain 3.0.0-RC2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the phphtmllib parameter.  NOTE: this issue might be in phpHtmlLib.  NOTE: CVE disputes this issue for proper installations of maintain, since $phphtmllib is set in includes.inc before being used in example6.php.
