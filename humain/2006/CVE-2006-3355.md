# CVE-2006-3355

Heap-based buffer overflow in httpdget.c in mpg123 before 0.59s-rll allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long URL, which is not properly terminated before being used with the strncpy function.  NOTE: This appears to be the result of an incomplete patch for CVE-2004-0982.
