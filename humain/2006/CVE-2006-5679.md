# CVE-2006-5679

- Published: 2006-11-03T22:07:00

- Modified: 2011-10-11T04:00:00

Integer overflow in the ffs_mountfs function in FreeBSD 6.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted UFS filesystem that causes invalid or large size parameters to be provided to the kmem_alloc function. NOTE: a third party states that this issue does not cross privilege boundaries in FreeBSD because only root may mount a filesystem.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
