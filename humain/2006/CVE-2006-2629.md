- Modified: 2017-07-20T01:31:00

Race condition in Linux kernel 2.6.15 to 2.6.17, when running on SMP platforms, allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) by creating and exiting a large number of tasks, then accessing the /proc entry of a task that is exiting, which causes memory corruption that leads to a failure in the prune_dcache function or a BUG_ON error in include/linux/list.h.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
