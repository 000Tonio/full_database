# CVE-2006-7067

- Published: 2007-03-02T21:18:00

- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:29:00

Oracle 10g R2 and possibly other versions allows remote attackers to trigger internal errors, and possibly have other impacts, via an "alter session set events" command with invalid arguments.  NOTE: this issue was originally disputed by a third party, but the dispute was retracted.  NOTE: this issue was called an "integer overflow" in the original source, but this might be incorrect.
