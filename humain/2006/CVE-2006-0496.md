- Published: 2006-02-01T02:02:00

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Mozilla 1.7.12 and possibly earlier, Mozilla Firefox 1.0.7 and possibly earlier, and Netscape 8.1 and possibly earlier, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the -moz-binding (Cascading Style Sheets) CSS property, which does not require that the style sheet have the same origin as the web page, as demonstrated by the compromise of a large number of LiveJournal accounts.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
