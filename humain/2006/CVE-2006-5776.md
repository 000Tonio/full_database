# CVE-2006-5776

- Published: 2006-11-07T00:07:00

** DISPUTED **  Multiple PHP remote file inclusions in Ariadne 2.4.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via the ariadne parameter in (1) ftp/loader.php and (2) lib/includes/loader.cmd.php.  NOTE: this issue is disputed by CVE, since installation instructions recommend that the files be placed outside of the web document root and require the administrator to modify $ariadne in an include file.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
