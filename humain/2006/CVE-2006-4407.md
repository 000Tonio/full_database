- Published: 2006-11-30T16:28:00

- Modified: 2011-03-08T02:40:00

The Security Framework in Apple Mac OS X 10.3.x up to 10.3.9 does not properly prioritize encryption ciphers when negotiating the strongest shared cipher, which causes Secure Transport to user a weaker cipher that makes it easier for remote attackers to decrypt traffic.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
