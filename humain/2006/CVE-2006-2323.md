Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in SmartISoft phpListPro 2.01 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the returnpath parameter in (1) editsite.php, (2) addsite.php, and (3) in.php.  NOTE: The config.php vector is already covered by CVE-2006-1749. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
