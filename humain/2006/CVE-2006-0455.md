# CVE-2006-0455

- Published: 2006-02-15T22:06:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:16:00

gpgv in GnuPG before 1.4.2.1, when using unattended signature verification, returns a 0 exit code in certain cases even when the detached signature file does not carry a signature, which could cause programs that use gpgv to assume that the signature verification has succeeded. Note: this also occurs when running the equivalent command "gpg --verify".
