# CVE-2006-7108

- Published: 2007-03-04T22:19:00

- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:31:00

login in util-linux-2.12a skips pam_acct_mgmt and chauth_tok when authentication is skipped, such as when a Kerberos krlogin session has been established, which might allow users to bypass intended access policies that would be enforced by pam_acct_mgmt and chauth_tok.

### CVSS Score: **4.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
