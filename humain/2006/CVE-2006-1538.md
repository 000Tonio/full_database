The Enova X-Wall ASIC encrypts with a key obtained via Microwire from a serial EEPROM that stores the key in cleartext, which allows local users with physical access to obtain the key by reading and duplicating an EEPROM that is located on a hardware token, or by sniffing the Microwire bus. Physical access to the device or hardware token is required to perform
the attack.
