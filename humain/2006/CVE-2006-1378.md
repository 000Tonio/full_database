# CVE-2006-1378

- Published: 2006-03-24T02:02:00

PasswordSafe 3.0 beta, when running on Windows before XP, uses a weak random number generator (C++ rand function) during generation of the database encryption key, which makes it easier for attackers to decrypt the database and steal passwords by generating keys for all possible rand() seed values and conducting a known plaintext attack. This vulnerability exists only in Windows OS environments before XP.  For some reason it would not let me notate that in the "vulnerable software" section.
