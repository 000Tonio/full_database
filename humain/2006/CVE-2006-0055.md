# CVE-2006-0055

- Published: 2006-01-11T21:03:00

- Modified: 2017-07-20T01:29:00

The ispell_op function in ee on FreeBSD 4.10 to 6.0 uses predictable filenames and does not confirm which file is being written, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack when ee invokes ispell.
