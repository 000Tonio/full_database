# CVE-2006-4759

- Published: 2006-09-13T23:07:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:39:00

PunBB 1.2.12 does not properly handle an avatar directory pathname ending in %00, which allows remote authenticated administrative users to upload arbitrary files and execute code, as demonstrated by a query to admin_options.php with an avatars_dir parameter ending in %00. NOTE: this issue was originally disputed by the vendor, but the dispute was withdrawn on 20060926. Successful exploitation requires that the attacker has Administrative rights.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
