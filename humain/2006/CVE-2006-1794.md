# CVE-2006-1794

- Published: 2006-04-17T10:02:00

SQL injection vulnerability in Mambo 4.5.3, 4.5.3h, and possibly earlier versions allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via (1) the $username variable in the mosGetParam function and (2) the $task parameter in the mosMenuCheck function in (a) includes/mambo.php; and (3) the $filter variable to the showCategory function in the com_content component (content.php). Successful exploitation requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.
