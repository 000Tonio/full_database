The cgi.rb CGI library for Ruby 1.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and CPU consumption) via an HTTP request with a multipart MIME body that contains an invalid boundary specifier, as demonstrated using a specifier that begins with a "-" instead of "--" and contains an inconsistent ID.
