# CVE-2006-6318

- Published: 2006-12-28T20:28:00

- Modified: 2011-03-08T02:45:00

The show_elog_list function in elogd.c in elog 2.6.2 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) by attempting to access a logbook whose name begins with "global," which results in a NULL pointer dereference.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information. Successful exploitation requires authentication only if the application is configured with a password. It is not, by default.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
