PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in includes/functions_common.php in the VWar Account module (vWar_Account) in PHPNuke Clan 3.0.1 allows remote attackers to include arbitrary files via a URL in the vwar_root2 parameter.  NOTE: it is possible that this issue stems from a problem in VWar itself, but this is not clear.
