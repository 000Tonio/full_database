# CVE-2006-1912

- Published: 2006-04-20T18:06:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:37:00

MyBB (MyBulletinBoard) 1.1.0 does not set the constant KILL_GLOBAL variable in (1) global.php and (2) inc/init.php, which allows remote attackers to initialize arbitrary variables that are processed by an @extract command, which could then be leveraged to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) or SQL injection attacks. Upgrade to MyBB 1.1.1

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
