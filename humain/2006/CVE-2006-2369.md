# CVE-2006-2369

- Published: 2006-05-15T16:06:00

- Modified: 2022-05-13T18:15:00

RealVNC 4.1.1, and other products that use RealVNC such as AdderLink IP and Cisco CallManager, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a request in which the client specifies an insecure security type such as "Type 1 - None", which is accepted even if it is not offered by the server, as originally demonstrated using a long password.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
