ActiveCampaign SupportTrio 2.5 allows remote attackers to obtain the full path of the server via invalid (1) article or (2) print parameters in a kb action to index.php, or (3) an invalid category parameter to modules/KB/pdf.php, which leaks the path in an error message.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
