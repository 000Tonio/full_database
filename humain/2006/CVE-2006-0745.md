# CVE-2006-0745

- Published: 2006-03-21T02:06:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:46:00

X.Org server (xorg-server) 1.0.0 and later, X11R6.9.0, and X11R7.0 inadvertently treats the address of the geteuid function as if it is the return value of a call to geteuid, which allows local users to bypass intended restrictions and (1) execute arbitrary code via the -modulepath command line option or (2) overwrite arbitrary files via -logfile.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
