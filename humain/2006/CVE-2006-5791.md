Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in elogd.c in ELOG 2.6.2 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTML or web script via (1) the filename for downloading, which is not quoted in an error message by the send_file_direct function, and (2) the Type or Category values in a New entry, which is not properly handled in an error message by the submit_elog function.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
