# CVE-2006-3392

- Published: 2006-07-06T20:05:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:47:00

Webmin before 1.290 and Usermin before 1.220 calls the simplify_path function before decoding HTML, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files, as demonstrated using "..%01" sequences, which bypass the removal of "../" sequences before bytes such as "%01" are removed from the filename.  NOTE: This is a different issue than CVE-2006-3274.

### CVSS Score: **5**
