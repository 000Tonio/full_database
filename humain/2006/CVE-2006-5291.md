# CVE-2006-5291

- Published: 2006-10-16T18:07:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:42:00

PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in admin/includes/spaw/spaw_control.class.php in Download-Engine 1.4.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the spaw_root parameter.  NOTE: CVE analysis suggests that this issue is actually in a third party product, SPAW Editor PHP Edition, so this issue is probably a duplicate of CVE-2006-4656.
