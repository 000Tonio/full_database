# CVE-2006-1785

- Published: 2006-04-13T22:02:00

Adobe Document Server for Reader Extensions 6.0 allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script via a leading (1) ftp or (2) http URI in the ReaderURL variable in the "Update Download Site" section of ads-readerext.  NOTE: it is not clear whether the vendor advisory addresses this issue.  In addition, since the issue requires administrative privileges to exploit, it is not clear whether this crosses security boundaries.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
