** DISPUTED **  MySQL 5.0.18 allows local users with access to a VIEW to obtain sensitive information via the "SELECT * FROM information_schema.views;" query, which returns the query that created the VIEW.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by third parties, saying that the availability of the schema is a normal and sometimes desired aspect of database access.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
