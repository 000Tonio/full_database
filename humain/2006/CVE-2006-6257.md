The file manager in AlternC 0.9.5 and earlier, when warnings are enabled in PHP, allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via certain folder names such as ones composed of JavaScript code, which reveal the path in a warning message. Successful exploitation requires that warnings are enabled in PHP.
