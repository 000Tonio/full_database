GGZ Gaming Zone 0.0.12 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (client disconnect) via inputs that produce malformed XML, including (1) trailing ' (apostrophe) character on the ID attribute in a PLAYER XML tag, (2) joining with a long ID attribute or non-trailing ' characters, which causes a <none> name to be assigned, and then disconnecting, or (3) a long CDATA message attribute, which prevents closing tags from being added to the string.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| --- | --- | --- |
