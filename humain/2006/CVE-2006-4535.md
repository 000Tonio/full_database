- Published: 2006-09-19T19:07:00

- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:31:00

The Linux kernel 2.6.17.10 and 2.6.17.11 and 2.6.18-rc5 allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) via an SCTP socket with a certain SO_LINGER value, possibly related to the patch for CVE-2006-3745.  NOTE: older kernel versions for specific Linux distributions are also affected, due to backporting of the CVE-2006-3745 patch.
