choose_file.php in easy-CMS 0.1.2, when mod_mime is installed, does not restrict uploads of filenames with multiple extensions, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a PHP file with a GIF file extension, then directly accessing that file in the Repositories directory.
