# CVE-2006-1235

- Published: 2006-03-14T23:02:00

Directory traversal vulnerability in admin/deleteuser.php in HitHost 1.0.0 might allow remote attackers to delete directories (possibly only empty directories) via the $deleteuser variable.  NOTE: the initial disclosure for this issue indicated that the researcher was unable to prove this issue; however, this might have been due to certain behaviors of rmdir.
