# CVE-2006-5444

- Published: 2006-10-23T17:07:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:42:00

Integer overflow in the get_input function in the Skinny channel driver (chan_skinny.c) in Asterisk 1.0.x before 1.0.12 and 1.2.x before 1.2.13, as used by Cisco SCCP phones, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a certain dlen value that passes a signed integer comparison and leads to a heap-based buffer overflow. Failed exploit attempts will likely crash the server, denying further service to legitimate users.
This vulnerability is addressed in the following product releases:
Asterisk, Asterisk, 1.0.12 or later
Asterisk, Asterisk, 1.2.13 or later
