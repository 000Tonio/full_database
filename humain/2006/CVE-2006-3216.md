Clearswift MAILsweeper for SMTP before 4.3.20 and MAILsweeper for Exchange before 4.3.20 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via (1) non-ASCII characters in a reverse DNS lookup result from a Received header, which leads to a Receiver service stop, and (2) unspecified vectors involving malformed messages, which causes "unpredictable behavior" that prevents the Security service from processing more messages. This vulnerability is addressed in the following product releases:
Clearswift, MAILsweeper for SMTP, 4.3.20 
Clearswift, MAILsweeper for Exchange, 4.3.20

### CVSS Score: **5**
