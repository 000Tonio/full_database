# CVE-2006-5984

- Published: 2006-11-20T21:07:00

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Helm Web Hosting Control Panel 3.2.10 allow remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) txtCompanyName, (2) txtEmail, or (3) txtUserAccNum parameter to (a) users.asp, or the (4) setThemeColour parameter to (b) default.asp in the Reseller and Admin levels; or the (5) setThemeColour parameter to default.asp in the User level.  NOTE: the txtDomainName parameter to domains.asp is covered by CVE-2006-1407, which suggests that this vector is fixed in 3.2.10 stable.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
