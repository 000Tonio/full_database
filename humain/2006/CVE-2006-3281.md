# CVE-2006-3281

- Published: 2006-06-28T22:05:00

- Modified: 2021-07-23T12:55:00

Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 does not properly handle Drag and Drop events, which allows remote user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via a link to an SMB file share with a filename that contains encoded ..\ (%2e%2e%5c) sequences and whose extension contains the CLSID Key identifier for HTML Applications (HTA), aka "Folder GUID Code Execution Vulnerability."  NOTE: directory traversal sequences were used in the original exploit, although their role is not clear.
