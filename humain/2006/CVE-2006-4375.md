** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in contxtd.class.php in the Contacts XTD (ContXTD) component for Mambo (com_contxtd) allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the mosConfig_absolute_path parameter.  NOTE: another researcher has disputed this issue, saying that the software prevents the attack by checking whether _VALID_MOS is defined.
