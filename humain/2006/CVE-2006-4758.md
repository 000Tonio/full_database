# CVE-2006-4758

- Published: 2006-09-13T23:07:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:39:00

phpBB 2.0.21 does not properly handle pathnames ending in %00, which allows remote authenticated administrative users to upload arbitrary files, as demonstrated by a query to admin/admin_board.php with an avatar_path parameter ending in .php%00. Successful exploitation requires that the attacker has Administrative rights.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
