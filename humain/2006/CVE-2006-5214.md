# CVE-2006-5214

- Published: 2006-10-10T04:06:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:25:00

Race condition in the Xsession script, as used by X Display Manager (xdm) in NetBSD before 20060212, X.Org before 20060225, and Solaris 8 through 10 before 20061006, causes a user's Xsession errors file to have weak permissions before a chmod is performed, which allows local users to read Xsession errors files of other users.

### CVSS Score: **1.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
