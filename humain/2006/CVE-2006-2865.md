# CVE-2006-2865

** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in template.php in phpBB 2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the page parameter.  NOTE: followup posts have disputed this issue, stating that template.php does not appear in phpBB and does not use a $page variable.  It is possible that this is a site-specific vulnerability, or an issue in a mod.
