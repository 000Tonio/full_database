Headstart Solutions DeskPRO does not require authentication for certain files and directories associated with administrative activities, which allows remote attackers to (1) reinstall the application via a direct request for install/index.php; (2) delete the database via a do=delete_database QUERY_STRING to a renamed copy of install/index.php; or access the administration system, after guessing a filename, via a direct request for a file in (3) admin/ or (4) tech/. Only certain files are affected, so the impact is partial for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
