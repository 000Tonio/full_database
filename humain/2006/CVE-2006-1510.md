Buffer overflow in calloc.c in the Microsoft Windows XP SP2 ntdll.dll system library, when used by the ILDASM disassembler in the Microsoft .NET 1.0 and 1.1 SDK, might allow user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted .dll file with a large static method. Succesful exploitation can only occur when ntdll.dll system library is used by the ILDASM disassembler in the Microsoft .NET 1.0 and 1.1 SDK packages.
