- Published: 2006-05-30T10:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T16:41:00

** UNVERIFIABLE **  NOTE: this issue does not contain any verifiable or actionable details.  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Marco M. F. De Santis Php-residence 0.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via "any of its input."  NOTE: the original disclosure is based on vague researcher claims without vendor acknowledgement; therefore this identifier cannot be linked with any future identifier that identifies more specific vectors.  Perhaps this should not be included in CVE.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
