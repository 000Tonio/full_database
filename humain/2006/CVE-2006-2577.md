- Published: 2006-05-24T23:02:00

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Docebo 3.0.3 and earlier, when register_globals is enabled, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in (1) where_cms, (2) where_lms, (3) where_upgrade, (4) BBC_LIB_PATH, and (5) BBC_LANGUAGE_PATH parameters in various unspecified scripts. NOTE: the provenance of some of this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
