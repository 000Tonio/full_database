# CVE-2006-7227

- Published: 2007-11-14T21:46:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:17:00

Integer overflow in Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before 6.7 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a regular expression containing a large number of named subpatterns (name_count) or long subpattern names (max_name_size), which triggers a buffer overflow. NOTE: this issue was originally subsumed by CVE-2006-7224, but that CVE has been REJECTED and split.
