- Published: 2006-02-25T11:02:00

Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in NOCC Webmail 1.0 allow remote attackers to include arbitrary files via .. (dot dot) sequences and a trailing NULL (%00) byte in (1) the _SESSION['nocc_theme'] parameter in (a) html/footer.php; and (2) the lang and (3) theme parameters and the (4) Accept-Language HTTP header field, when force_default_lang is disabled, in (b) index.php, as demonstrated by injecting PHP code into a profile and accessing it using the lang parameter in index.php.

### CVSS Score: **5**
