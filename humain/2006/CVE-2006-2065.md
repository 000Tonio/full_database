SQL injection vulnerability in save.php in PHPSurveyor 0.995 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the surveyid cookie.  NOTE: this issue could be leveraged to execute arbitrary PHP code, as demonstrated by inserting directory traversal sequences into the database, which are then processed by the thissurvey['language'] variable.
