Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in register.php in Tritanium Bulletin Board (TBB) 1.2.3 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) newuser_name, (2) newuser_email, and (3) newuser_hp parameters in the faction=register mode in index.php. Succesful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
