# CVE-2006-6982

- Published: 2007-02-08T18:28:00

3proxy 0.5 to 0.5.2 does not offer NTLM authentication before basic authentication, which might cause browsers with incomplete RFC2616/RFC2617 support to use basic cleartext authentication even if NTLM is available, which makes it easier for attackers to steal credentials. The link is to the vendor's changelog.  The vendor's download site is:
http://3proxy.ru/download/

For the latest build.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
