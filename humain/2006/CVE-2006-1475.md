Windows Firewall in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 does not produce application alerts when an application is executed using the NTFS Alternate Data Streams (ADS) filename:stream syntax, which might allow local users to launch a Trojan horse attack in which the victim does not obtain the alert that Windows Firewall would have produced for a non-ADS file.
