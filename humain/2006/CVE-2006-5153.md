The (1) fwdrv.sys and (2) khips.sys drivers in Sunbelt Kerio Personal Firewall 4.3.268 and earlier do not validate arguments passed through to SSDT functions, including NtCreateFile, NtDeleteFile, NtLoadDriver, NtMapViewOfSection, NtOpenFile, and NtSetInformationFile, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly other impacts via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
