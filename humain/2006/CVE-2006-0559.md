Format string vulnerability in the SMTP server for McAfee WebShield 4.5 MR2 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format strings in the domain name portion of a destination address, which are not properly handled when a bounce message is constructed. The vendor has released a patch (P0803), along with version 4.5 MR2 to address this issue.
