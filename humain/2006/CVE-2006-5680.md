# CVE-2006-5680

- Published: 2006-11-09T00:07:00

- Modified: 2017-07-20T01:33:00

The libarchive library in FreeBSD 6-STABLE after 2006-09-05 and before 2006-11-08 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a malformed archive that causes libarchive to skip a region past the actual end of the archive, which triggers an infinite loop that attempts to read more data.

### CVSS Score: **5**
