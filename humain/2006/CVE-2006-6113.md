- Published: 2006-11-28T23:28:00

Monkey Boards 0.3.5 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via direct requests to (1) include/admin_auth.inc.php and (2) include/engine/class.compiler.php, which reveals the full path in an error message.  NOTE: this issue is only an exposure if the administrator has changed the default script path.

### CVSS Score: **5**
