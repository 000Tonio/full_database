** DISPUTED **  Tor before 0.1.1.20 kills the circuit when it receives an unrecognized relay command, which causes network circuits to be disbanded.  NOTE: while this item is listed under the "Security fixes" section of the developer changelog, the developer clarified on 20060707 that this is only a self-DoS.  Therefore this issue should not be included in CVE.
