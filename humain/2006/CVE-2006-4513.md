Multiple integer overflows in the WV library in wvWare (formerly mswordview) before 1.2.3, as used by AbiWord, KWord, and possibly other products, allow user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted Microsoft Word (DOC) file that produces (1) large LFO clfolvl values in the wvGetLFO_records function or (2) a large LFO nolfo value in the wvGetFLO_PLF function.
