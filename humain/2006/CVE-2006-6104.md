- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:46:00

The System.Web class in the XSP for ASP.NET server 1.1 through 2.0 in Mono does not properly verify local pathnames, which allows remote attackers to (1) read source code by appending a space (%20) to a URI, and (2) read credentials via a request for Web.Config%20.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
