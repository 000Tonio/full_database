# CVE-2006-5710

- Published: 2006-11-04T01:07:00

- Modified: 2017-07-20T01:33:00

The Airport driver for certain Orinoco based Airport cards in Darwin kernel 8.8.0 in Apple Mac OS X 10.4.8, and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an 802.11 probe response frame without any valid information element (IE) fields after the header, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow. Failed exploit attempts will likely result in denial-of-service conditions.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
