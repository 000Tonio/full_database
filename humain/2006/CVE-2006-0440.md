Text Rider 2.4 allows attackers to bypass authentication and upload files without providing a valid password by obtaining the MD5 hash of the password (possibly via another vulnerability that reads it from a data file), then including the hash in a cookie.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
