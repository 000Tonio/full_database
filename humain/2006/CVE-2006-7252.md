Integer overflow in the calloc function in libc/stdlib/malloc.c in jemalloc in libc for FreeBSD 6.4 and NetBSD makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to perform memory-related attacks such as buffer overflows via a large size value, which triggers a memory allocation of one byte.

### CVSS Score: **5**
