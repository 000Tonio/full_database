# CVE-2006-5500

- Published: 2006-10-25T10:07:00

- Modified: 2011-03-08T02:43:00

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the checkUser function in inc/DBInterface.php in XchangeBoard 1.70 and earlier, when magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) userNick or (2) password parameters.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained from third party information. Successful exploitation requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.
