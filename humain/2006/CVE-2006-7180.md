- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:29:00

ieee80211_output.c in MadWifi before 0.9.3 sends unencrypted packets before WPA authentication succeeds, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (related to network structure), and possibly cause a denial of service (disrupted authentication) and conduct spoofing attacks.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
