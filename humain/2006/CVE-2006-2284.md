Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Claroline 1.7.5 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the (1) clarolineRepositorySys parameter in ldap.inc.php and the (2) claro_CasLibPath parameter in casProcess.inc.php. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
