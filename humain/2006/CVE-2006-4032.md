Unspecified vulnerability in Cisco IOS CallManager Express (CME) allows remote attackers to gain sensitive information (user names) from the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) user directory via certain SIP messages, aka bug CSCse92417. Cisco's recommended best practice of implementing the VoIP infrastructure and data devices on separate VLANs would prevent malicious users from launching such attacks against the VoIP network.
