# CVE-2006-0096

- Published: 2006-01-06T11:03:00

- Modified: 2018-10-03T21:34:00

wan/sdla.c in Linux kernel 2.6.x before 2.6.11 and 2.4.x before 2.4.29 does not require the CAP_SYS_RAWIO privilege for an SDLA firmware upgrade, with unknown impact and local attack vectors.  NOTE: further investigation suggests that this issue requires root privileges to exploit, since it is protected by CAP_NET_ADMIN; thus it might not be a vulnerability, although capabilities provide finer distinctions between privilege levels.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |
