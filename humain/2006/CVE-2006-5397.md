# CVE-2006-5397

- Published: 2006-11-03T00:07:00

- Modified: 2017-07-20T01:33:00

The Xinput module (modules/im/ximcp/imLcIm.c) in X.Org libX11 1.0.2 and 1.0.3 opens a file for reading twice using the same file descriptor, which causes a file descriptor leak that allows local users to read files specified by the XCOMPOSEFILE environment variable via the duplicate file descriptor.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
