# CVE-2006-4586

- Published: 2006-09-06T22:04:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T21:38:00

The admin panel in Tr Forum 2.0 accepts a username and password hash for authentication, which allows remote authenticated users to perform unauthorized actions, as demonstrated by modifying user settings via the id parameter to /membres/modif_profil.php, and changing a password via /membres/change_mdp.php.  NOTE: this can be leveraged with other Tr Forum vulnerabilities to allow unauthenticated attackers to gain privileges.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
