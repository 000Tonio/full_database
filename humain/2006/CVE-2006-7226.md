- Published: 2007-12-03T20:46:00

- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:31:00

Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before 6.7 does not properly calculate the compiled memory allocation for regular expressions that involve a quantified "subpattern containing a named recursion or subroutine reference," which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (error or crash).

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
