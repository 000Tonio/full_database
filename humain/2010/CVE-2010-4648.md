# CVE-2010-4648

- Published: 2012-06-21T23:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T03:20:00

The orinoco_ioctl_set_auth function in drivers/net/wireless/orinoco/wext.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.37 does not properly implement a TKIP protection mechanism, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access to a Wi-Fi network by reading Wi-Fi frames.

### CVSS Score: **3.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
