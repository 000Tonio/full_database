Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) 2.3.x before 2.3.6 and 2.4.x before 2.4.8 does not properly handle the matching of Perl regular expressions against HTML e-mail messages, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a large message, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2080.
