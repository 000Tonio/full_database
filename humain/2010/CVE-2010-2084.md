Microsoft ASP.NET 2.0 does not prevent setting the InnerHtml property on a control that inherits from HtmlContainerControl, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related to an attribute.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
