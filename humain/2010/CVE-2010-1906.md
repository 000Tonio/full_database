- Published: 2010-05-12T11:46:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T19:57:00

tgsrv.exe in the Repair Service in Consona Dynamic Agent, Repair Manager, Subscriber Activation, and Subscriber Agent relies on a predictable timestamp field to validate input to the \\.\pipe\__RepairService_pipe__company named pipe, which allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code by obtaining the current time from (1) tcpip.sys or (2) an SMB2 service.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
