- Published: 2010-09-20T22:00:00

- Modified: 2017-09-19T01:31:00

IBM DB2 9.7 before FP3 does not properly enforce privilege requirements for execution of entries in the dynamic SQL cache, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the cache to execute an UPDATE statement contained in a compiled compound SQL statement.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
