Kingston DataTraveler BlackBox (DTBB), DataTraveler Secure Privacy Edition (DTSP), and DataTraveler Elite Privacy Edition (DTEP) USB flash drives validate passwords with a program running on the host computer rather than the device hardware, which allows physically proximate attackers to access the cleartext drive contents via a modified program.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
