libspice, as used in QEMU-KVM in the Hypervisor (aka rhev-hypervisor) in Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization (RHEV) 2.2 and qspice 0.3.0, does not properly restrict the addresses upon which memory-management actions are performed, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) or possibly gain privileges via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **6.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
