- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:27:00

The X.25 implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36.2 does not properly parse facilities, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption and panic) or possibly have unspecified other impact via malformed (1) X25_FAC_CALLING_AE or (2) X25_FAC_CALLED_AE data, related to net/x25/x25_facilities.c and net/x25/x25_in.c, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-4164.
