gdk/gdkwindow.c in GTK+ before 2.18.5, as used in gnome-screensaver before 2.28.1, performs implicit paints on windows of type GDK_WINDOW_FOREIGN, which triggers an X error in certain circumstances and consequently allows physically proximate attackers to bypass screen locking and access an unattended workstation by pressing the Enter key many times.
