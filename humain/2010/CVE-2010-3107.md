A certain ActiveX control in ienipp.ocx in the browser plugin in Novell iPrint Client before 5.42 does not properly restrict the set of files to be deleted, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (recursive file deletion) via unspecified vectors related to a "logic flaw" in the CleanUploadFiles method in the nipplib.dll module.
