** DISPUTED **  Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in MyBB (aka MyBulletinBoard) before 1.6.1 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the keywords parameter in a (1) do_search action to search.php or (2) do_stuff action to private.php.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, saying "Although this doesn't lead to an SQL injection, it does provide a general MyBB SQL error."
