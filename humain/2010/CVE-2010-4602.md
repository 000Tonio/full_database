The Web client in IBM Rational ClearQuest 7.1.1.x before 7.1.1.4 and 7.1.2.x before 7.1.2.1 allows remote authenticated users to bypass "restricted user" limitations, and read arbitrary records, via a modified record number in the URL for a RECORD action, as demonstrated by a modified bookmark.

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
