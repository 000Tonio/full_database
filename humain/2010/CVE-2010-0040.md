Integer overflow in ColorSync in Apple Safari before 4.0.5 on Windows, and iTunes before 9.1, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash) via an image with a crafted color profile that triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

ColorSync
CVE-ID:  CVE-2010-0040
Available for:  Windows 7, Vista, XP
Impact:  Viewing a maliciously crafted image with an embedded color
profile may lead to an unexpected application termination or
arbitrary code execution
Description:  An integer overflow, that could result in a heap buffer
overflow, exists in the handling of images with an embedded color
profile. Opening a maliciously crafted image with an embedded color
profile may lead to an unexpected application termination or
arbitrary code execution. The issue is addressed by performing
additional validation of color profiles. This issue does not affect
Mac OS X systems. Credit to Sebastien Renaud of VUPEN Vulnerability
