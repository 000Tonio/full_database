# CVE-2010-1146

- Published: 2010-04-12T18:30:00

- Modified: 2020-08-28T16:06:00

The Linux kernel 2.6.33.2 and earlier, when a ReiserFS filesystem exists, does not restrict read or write access to the .reiserfs_priv directory, which allows local users to gain privileges by modifying (1) extended attributes or (2) ACLs, as demonstrated by deleting a file under .reiserfs_priv/xattrs/.

### CVSS Score: **6.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
