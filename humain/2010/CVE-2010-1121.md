# CVE-2010-1121

- Published: 2010-03-25T21:00:00

- Modified: 2017-09-19T01:30:00

Mozilla Firefox 3.6.x before 3.6.3 does not properly manage the scopes of DOM nodes that are moved from one document to another, which allows remote attackers to conduct use-after-free attacks and execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors involving improper interaction with garbage collection, as demonstrated by Nils during a Pwn2Own competition at CanSecWest 2010.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
