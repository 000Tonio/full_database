browser/login/login_prompt.cc in Google Chrome before 4.0.249.89 populates an authentication dialog with credentials that were stored by Password Manager for a different web site, which allows user-assisted remote HTTP servers to obtain sensitive information via a URL that requires authentication, as demonstrated by a URL in the SRC attribute of an IMG element.
