- Published: 2010-08-05T18:17:00

- Modified: 2010-09-09T05:43:00

The vte_sequence_handler_window_manipulation function in vteseq.c in libvte (aka libvte9) in VTE 0.25.1 and earlier, as used in gnome-terminal, does not properly handle escape sequences, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands or obtain potentially sensitive information via a (1) window title or (2) icon title sequence.  NOTE: this issue exists because of a CVE-2003-0070 regression. Per: http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html

'CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection')'
