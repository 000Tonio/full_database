# CVE-2010-1187

- Published: 2010-03-31T18:00:00

- Modified: 2020-08-13T14:10:00

The Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) functionality in Linux kernel 2.6.16-rc1 through 2.6.33, and possibly other versions, allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel OOPS) by sending datagrams through AF_TIPC before entering network mode, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
