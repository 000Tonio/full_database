- Published: 2010-05-21T20:30:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:32:00

The auto-complete functionality in the Chaos Tool Suite (aka CTools) module 6.x before 6.x-1.4 for Drupal does not follow access restrictions, which allows remote authenticated users, with "access content" privileges, to read the title of an unpublished node via a q=ctools/autocomplete/node/ value accompanied by the first character of the node's title.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
