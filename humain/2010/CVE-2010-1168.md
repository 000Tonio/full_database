- Modified: 2017-09-19T01:30:00

The Safe (aka Safe.pm) module before 2.25 for Perl allows context-dependent attackers to bypass intended (1) Safe::reval and (2) Safe::rdo access restrictions, and inject and execute arbitrary code, via vectors involving implicitly called methods and implicitly blessed objects, as demonstrated by the (a) DESTROY and (b) AUTOLOAD methods, related to "automagic methods."

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
