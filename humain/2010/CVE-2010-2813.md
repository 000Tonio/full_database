# CVE-2010-2813

- Published: 2010-08-19T18:00:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:32:00

functions/imap_general.php in SquirrelMail before 1.4.21 does not properly handle 8-bit characters in passwords, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disk consumption) by making many IMAP login attempts with different usernames, leading to the creation of many preferences files.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
