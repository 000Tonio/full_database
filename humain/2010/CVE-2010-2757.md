The sudo feature in Bugzilla 2.22rc1 through 3.2.7, 3.3.1 through 3.4.7, 3.5.1 through 3.6.1, and 3.7 through 3.7.2 does not properly send impersonation notifications, which makes it easier for remote authenticated users to impersonate other users without discovery.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
