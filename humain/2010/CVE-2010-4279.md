# CVE-2010-4279

- Published: 2010-12-02T17:15:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T20:07:00

The default configuration of Pandora FMS 3.1 and earlier specifies an empty string for the loginhash_pwd field, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by sending a request to index.php with "admin" in the loginhash_user parameter, in conjunction with the md5 hash of "admin" in the loginhash_data parameter.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
