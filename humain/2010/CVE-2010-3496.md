# CVE-2010-3496

- Published: 2012-08-22T10:42:00

- Modified: 2012-08-22T10:42:00

McAfee VirusScan Enterprise 8.5i and 8.7i does not properly interact with the processing of hcp:// URLs by the Microsoft Help and Support Center, which makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via malware that is correctly detected by this product, but with a detection approach that occurs too late to stop the code execution.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
