# CVE-2010-2495

- Published: 2010-09-08T20:00:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T03:15:00

The pppol2tp_xmit function in drivers/net/pppol2tp.c in the L2TP implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.34 does not properly validate certain values associated with an interface, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors related to a routing change.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |
