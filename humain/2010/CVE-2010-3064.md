Stack-based buffer overflow in the php_mysqlnd_auth_write function in the Mysqlnd extension in PHP 5.3 through 5.3.2 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long (1) username or (2) database name argument to the (a) mysql_connect or (b) mysqli_connect function.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
