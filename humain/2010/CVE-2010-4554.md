- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:33:00

functions/page_header.php in SquirrelMail 1.4.21 and earlier does not prevent page rendering inside a frame in a third-party HTML document, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct clickjacking attacks via a crafted web site.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
