Aavmker4.sys in avast! 4.8 through 4.8.1368.0 and 5.0 before 5.0.418.0 running on Windows 2000 and XP does not properly validate input to IOCTL 0xb2d60030, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code to gain privileges via IOCTL requests using crafted kernel addresses that trigger memory corruption.
