The nsDocShell::OnRedirectStateChange function in docshell/base/nsDocShell.cpp in Mozilla Firefox 3.5.x before 3.5.11 and 3.6.x before 3.6.7, and SeaMonkey before 2.0.6, allows remote attackers to spoof the SSL security status of a document via vectors involving multiple requests, a redirect, and the history.back and history.forward JavaScript functions.
