# CVE-2010-4729

- Published: 2011-02-08T22:00:00

- Modified: 2011-02-14T05:00:00

Zikula before 1.2.3 does not use the authid protection mechanism for (1) the lostpassword form and (2) mailpasswd processing, which makes it easier for remote attackers to generate a flood of password requests and possibly conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks via multiple form submissions.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
