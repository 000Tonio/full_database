# CVE-2010-4626

- Published: 2010-12-30T21:00:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:33:00

The my_rand function in functions.php in MyBB (aka MyBulletinBoard) before 1.4.12 does not properly use the PHP mt_rand function, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access to an arbitrary account by requesting a reset of the account's password, and then conducting a brute-force attack.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
