SilverStripe 2.3.x before 2.3.10 and 2.4.x before 2.4.4 allows remote attackers to bypass the cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection mechanism and hijack the authentication of administrators via vectors related to "form action requests" using a controller.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
