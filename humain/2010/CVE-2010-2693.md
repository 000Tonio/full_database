FreeBSD 7.1 through 8.1-PRERELEASE does not copy the read-only flag when creating a duplicate mbuf buffer reference, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system file corruption) and gain privileges via the sendfile system call.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
