# CVE-2010-3338

- Published: 2010-12-16T19:33:00

The Windows Task Scheduler in Microsoft Windows Vista SP1 and SP2, Windows Server 2008 Gold, SP2, and R2, and Windows 7 does not properly determine the security context of scheduled tasks, which allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted application, aka "Task Scheduler Vulnerability." NOTE: this might overlap CVE-2010-3888.
