The video_usercopy function in drivers/media/video/v4l2-ioctl.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39 relies on the count value of a v4l2_ext_controls data structure to determine a kmalloc size, which might allow local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large value.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |
