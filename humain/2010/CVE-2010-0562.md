# CVE-2010-0562

- Published: 2010-02-08T21:30:00

The sdump function in sdump.c in fetchmail 6.3.11, 6.3.12, and 6.3.13, when running in verbose mode on platforms for which char is signed, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via an SSL X.509 certificate containing non-printable characters with the high bit set, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow during escaping.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
