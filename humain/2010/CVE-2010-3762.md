- Published: 2010-10-05T22:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T20:05:00

ISC BIND before 9.7.2-P2, when DNSSEC validation is enabled, does not properly handle certain bad signatures if multiple trust anchors exist for a single zone, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a DNS query.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
