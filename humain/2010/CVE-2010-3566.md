Unspecified vulnerability in the 2D component in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 21, 5.0 Update and 25 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the October 2010 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable researcher that this is an integer overflow that leads to a buffer overflow via a crafted devs (device information) tag structure in a color profile.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
