# CVE-2010-4001

- Published: 2010-11-06T00:00:00

** DISPUTED ** GMXRC.bash in Gromacs 4.5.1 and earlier places a zero-length directory name in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH, which allows local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse shared library in the current working directory.  NOTE: CVE disputes this issue because the GMXLDLIB value is always added to the beginning of LD_LIBRARY_PATH at a later point in the script.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**
