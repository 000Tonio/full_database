# CVE-2010-2531

- Published: 2010-08-20T22:00:00

- Modified: 2023-01-19T16:39:00

The var_export function in PHP 5.2 before 5.2.14 and 5.3 before 5.3.3 flushes the output buffer to the user when certain fatal errors occur, even if display_errors is off, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by causing the application to exceed limits for memory, execution time, or recursion.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
