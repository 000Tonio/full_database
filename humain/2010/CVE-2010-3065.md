- Published: 2010-08-20T20:00:00

- Modified: 2010-12-10T06:44:00

The default session serializer in PHP 5.2 through 5.2.13 and 5.3 through 5.3.2 does not properly handle the PS_UNDEF_MARKER marker, which allows context-dependent attackers to modify arbitrary session variables via a crafted session variable name.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
