Mozilla Firefox 3.6.x before 3.6.7 and Thunderbird 3.1.x before 3.1.1 do not properly implement access to a content object through a SafeJSObjectWrapper (aka SJOW) wrapper, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code with chrome privileges by leveraging "access to an object from the chrome scope."

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
