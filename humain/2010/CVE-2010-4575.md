The ThemeInstalledInfoBarDelegate::Observe function in browser/extensions/theme_installed_infobar_delegate.cc in Google Chrome before 8.0.552.224 and Chrome OS before 8.0.552.343 does not properly handle incorrect tab interaction by an extension, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted extension.
