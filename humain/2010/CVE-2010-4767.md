Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) before 2.3.6 does not properly handle e-mail messages in which the From line contains UTF-8 characters associated with diacritical marks and an invalid charset, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (duplicate tickets and duplicate auto-responses) by sending a crafted message to a POP3 mailbox.

### CVSS Score: **5**
