# CVE-2010-2480

- Published: 2010-07-02T19:00:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:21:00

Mako before 0.3.4 relies on the cgi.escape function in the Python standard library for cross-site scripting (XSS) protection, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct XSS attacks via vectors involving single-quote characters and a JavaScript onLoad event handler for a BODY element.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
