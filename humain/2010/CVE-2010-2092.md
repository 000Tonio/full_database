SQL injection vulnerability in graph.php in Cacti 0.8.7e and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via a crafted rra_id parameter in a GET request in conjunction with a valid rra_id value in a POST request or a cookie, which causes the POST or cookie value to bypass the validation routine, but inserts the $_GET value into the resulting query.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
