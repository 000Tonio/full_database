The installation documentation for Red Hat Enterprise Messaging, Realtime and Grid (MRG) 1.3 recommends that Condor should be configured so that the MRG Management Console (cumin) can submit jobs for users, which creates a trusted channel with insufficient access control that allows local users with the ability to publish to a broker to run jobs as arbitrary users via Condor QMF plug-ins.
