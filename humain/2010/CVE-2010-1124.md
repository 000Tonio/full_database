bos.rte.libc 5.3.9.4 on IBM AIX 5.3 does not properly support reading a certain address field after a successful getaddrinfo function call, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via unspecified vectors, as demonstrated by IBM DB2 crashes on "systems with databases cataloged with alternate servers using IP addresses."

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
