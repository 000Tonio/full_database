# CVE-2010-2580

- Published: 2010-09-15T18:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T19:59:00

The SMTP service (MESMTPC.exe) in MailEnable 3.x and 4.25 does not properly perform a length check, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long (1) email address in the MAIL FROM command, or (2) domain name in the RCPT TO command, which triggers an "unhandled invalid parameter error."

### CVSS Score: **5**
