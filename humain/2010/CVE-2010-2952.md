# CVE-2010-2952

- Published: 2010-09-13T21:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T20:00:00

Apache Traffic Server before 2.0.1, and 2.1.x before 2.1.2-unstable, does not properly choose DNS source ports and transaction IDs, and does not properly use DNS query fields to validate responses, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to poison the internal DNS cache via a crafted response.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
