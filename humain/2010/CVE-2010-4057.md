solid.exe in IBM solidDB 6.5.0.3 and earlier does not properly perform a recursive call to a certain function upon receiving packet data containing many integer fields with two different values, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid memory access and daemon crash) via a TCP session on port 1315.
