# CVE-2010-3697

- Published: 2010-10-07T21:00:00

- Modified: 2010-10-08T04:00:00

The wait_for_child_to_die function in main/event.c in FreeRADIUS 2.1.x before 2.1.10, in certain circumstances involving long-term database outages, does not properly handle long queue times for requests, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) by sending many requests.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
