- Published: 2010-08-19T18:00:00

- Modified: 2010-10-30T05:41:00

Red Hat libvirt, possibly 0.6.1 through 0.8.2, looks up disk backing stores without referring to the user-defined main disk format, which might allow guest OS users to read arbitrary files on the host OS, and possibly have unspecified other impact, via unknown vectors.

### CVSS Score: **4.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
