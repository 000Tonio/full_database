# CVE-2010-3453

- Published: 2011-01-28T22:00:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:25:00

The WW8ListManager::WW8ListManager function in oowriter in OpenOffice.org (OOo) 2.x and 3.x before 3.3 does not properly handle an unspecified number of list levels in user-defined list styles in WW8 data in a Microsoft Word document, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted .DOC file that triggers an out-of-bounds write.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**
