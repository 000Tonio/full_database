# CVE-2010-5335

- Published: 2019-10-11T11:15:00

IceWarp Webclient before 10.2.1 has a directory traversal vulnerability. This can result in loss of confidential data of IceWarp Mailserver and the operating system. Input passed via a certain parameter (script to basic/minimizer/index.php) is not properly sanitised and can therefore be exploited to browse the partition where IceWarp is installed (or the whole system) and read arbitrary files.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
