The XMLDocument::load function in Mozilla Firefox before 3.5.9 and 3.6.x before 3.6.2, Thunderbird before 3.0.4, and SeaMonkey before 2.0.4 does not perform the expected nsIContentPolicy checks during loading of content by XML documents, which allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via crafted content.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
