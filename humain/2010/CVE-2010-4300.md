Heap-based buffer overflow in the dissect_ldss_transfer function (epan/dissectors/packet-ldss.c) in the LDSS dissector in Wireshark 1.2.0 through 1.2.12 and 1.4.0 through 1.4.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via an LDSS packet with a long digest line that triggers memory corruption.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
