- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:32:00

Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in index.php in Linker IMG 1.0 and earlier allow remote attackers to read and execute arbitrary local files via a URL in the (1) cook_lan cookie parameter ($lan_dir variable) or possibly (2) Sdb_type parameter.  NOTE: this was originally reported as remote file inclusion, but this may be inaccurate.
