The Cisco Content Services Switch (CSS) 11500 with software 08.20.1.01 conveys authentication data through ClientCert-* headers but does not delete client-supplied ClientCert-* headers, which might allow remote attackers to bypass authentication via crafted header data, as demonstrated by a ClientCert-Subject-CN header, aka Bug ID CSCsz04690.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
