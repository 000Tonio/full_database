The site-locking implementation in the SdcWebSecureBase interface in tgctlcm.dll in Consona Live Assistance, Dynamic Agent, and Subscriber Assistance relies on a list of server domain names to restrict execution of ActiveX controls, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary code via a DNS hijacking attack.
