The jumpUrl (aka access tracking) implementation in tslib/class.tslib_fe.php in TYPO3 4.2.x before 4.2.15, 4.3.x before 4.3.7, and 4.4.x before 4.4.4 does not properly compare certain hash values during access-control decisions, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
