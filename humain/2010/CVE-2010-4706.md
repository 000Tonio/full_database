# CVE-2010-4706

- Published: 2011-01-24T19:00:00

- Modified: 2019-01-03T15:01:00

The pam_sm_close_session function in pam_xauth.c in the pam_xauth module in Linux-PAM (aka pam) 1.1.2 and earlier does not properly handle a failure to determine a certain target uid, which might allow local users to delete unintended files by executing a program that relies on the pam_xauth PAM check.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
