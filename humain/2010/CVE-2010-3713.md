rss.php in UseBB before 1.0.11 does not properly handle forum configurations in which a user has the view permission but not the read permission, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by reading a forum feed in combination with a topic feed.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
