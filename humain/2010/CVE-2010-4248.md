Race condition in the __exit_signal function in kernel/exit.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.37-rc2 allows local users to cause a denial of service via vectors related to multithreaded exec, the use of a thread group leader in kernel/posix-cpu-timers.c, and the selection of a new thread group leader in the de_thread function in fs/exec.c.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**
