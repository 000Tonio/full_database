Integer overflow in httpAdapter.c in httpAdapter in SBLIM SFCB 1.3.4 through 1.3.7, when the configuration sets httpMaxContentLength to a zero value, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a large integer in the Content-Length HTTP header, aka bug #3001915. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
