- Published: 2010-11-17T16:00:00

- Modified: 2010-11-18T05:00:00

Red Hat Certificate System (RHCS) 7.3 and 8 and Dogtag Certificate System do not require authentication for requests to decrypt SCEP one-time PINs, which allows remote attackers to obtain PINs by sniffing the network for SCEP requests and then sending decryption requests to the Certificate Authority component.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
