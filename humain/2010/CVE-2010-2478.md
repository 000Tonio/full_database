Integer overflow in the ethtool_get_rxnfc function in net/core/ethtool.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.33.7 on 32-bit platforms allows local users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via an ETHTOOL_GRXCLSRLALL ethtool command with a large info.rule_cnt value that triggers a buffer overflow, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-3084.
