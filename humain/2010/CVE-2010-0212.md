OpenLDAP 2.4.22 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a modrdn call with a zero-length RDN destination string, which is not properly handled by the smr_normalize function and triggers a NULL pointer dereference in the IA5StringNormalize function in schema_init.c, as demonstrated using the Codenomicon LDAPv3 test suite.

### CVSS Score: **5**
