Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (aka JBoss EAP or JBEAP) 4.2 before 4.2.0.CP09 and 4.3 before 4.3.0.CP08 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information about "deployed web contexts" via a request to the status servlet, as demonstrated by a full=true query string. NOTE: this issue exists because of a CVE-2008-3273 regression.
