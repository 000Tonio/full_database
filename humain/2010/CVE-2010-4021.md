# CVE-2010-4021

- Published: 2010-12-02T16:22:00

- Modified: 2020-01-21T15:45:00

The Key Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.7 does not properly restrict the use of TGT credentials for armoring TGS requests, which might allow remote authenticated users to impersonate a client by rewriting an inner request, aka a "KrbFastReq forgery issue."

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
