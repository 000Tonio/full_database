The read_from_cmd_socket function in cmdmon.c in chronyd in Chrony before 1.23.1, and 1.24-pre1, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and bandwidth consumption) by sending a spoofed cmdmon packet that triggers a continuous exchange of NOHOSTACCESS messages between two daemons, a related issue to CVE-2009-3563.
