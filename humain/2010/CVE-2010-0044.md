PubSub in Apple Safari before 4.0.5 does not properly implement use of the Accept Cookies preference to block cookies, which makes it easier for remote web servers to track users by setting a cookie in a (1) RSS or (2) Atom feed. Per: http://lists.apple.com/archives/security-announce/2010/Mar/msg00000.html

Impact:  Visiting or updating a feed may result in a cookie being

Description:  An implementation issue exists in the handling of
