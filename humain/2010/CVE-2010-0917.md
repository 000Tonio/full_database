Stack-based buffer overflow in VBScript in Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP2 and SP3, and Server 2003 SP2, when Internet Explorer is used, might allow user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long string in the fourth argument (aka helpfile argument) to the MsgBox function, leading to code execution when the F1 key is pressed, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-0483.
