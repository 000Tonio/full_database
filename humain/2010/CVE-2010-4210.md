# CVE-2010-4210

- Published: 2010-11-22T12:54:00

- Modified: 2017-10-05T01:29:00

The pfs_getextattr function in FreeBSD 7.x before 7.3-RELEASE and 8.x before 8.0-RC1 unlocks a mutex that was not previously locked, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel panic), overwrite arbitrary memory locations, and possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors related to opening a file on a file system that uses pseudofs.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
