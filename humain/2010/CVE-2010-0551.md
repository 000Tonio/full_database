# CVE-2010-0551

- Published: 2010-02-04T20:15:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T19:53:00

HTTP authentication implementation in Geo++ GNCASTER 1.4.0.7 and earlier allows remote attackers to read authentication headers of other users via a large request with an incorrect authentication attempt, which includes sensitive memory in the response.  NOTE: this is referred to as a "memory leak" by some sources, but is better characterized as "memory disclosure."

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
