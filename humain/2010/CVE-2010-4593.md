The Connection Manager in IBM Lotus Mobile Connect before 6.1.4 does not properly maintain a certain reference count, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (IP address exhaustion) by making invalid attempts to establish sessions with the same VPN ID from multiple devices.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
