IBM Tivoli Directory Server (TDS) 6.0.0.x before 6.0.0.8-TIV-ITDS-IF0007 does not properly handle invalid buffer references in LDAP BER requests, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via vectors involving a buffer that has a memory address near the maximum possible address.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
