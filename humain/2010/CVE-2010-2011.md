Microsoft Dynamics GP uses a substitution cipher to encrypt the system password field and unspecified other fields, which makes it easier for remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information by decrypting a field's contents.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
