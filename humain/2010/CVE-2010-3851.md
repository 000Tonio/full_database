- Published: 2010-11-04T18:00:00

- Modified: 2011-08-27T03:44:00

libguestfs before 1.5.23, as used in virt-v2v, virt-inspector 1.5.3 and earlier, and possibly other products, when a raw-format disk image is used, allows local guest OS administrators to read files from the host via a crafted (1) qcow2, (2) VMDK, or (3) VDI header, related to lack of support for a disk format specifier.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
