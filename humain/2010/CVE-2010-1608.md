Stack-based buffer overflow in IBM Lotus Notes 8.5 and 8.5fp1, and possibly other versions, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unknown attack vectors, as demonstrated by the vd_ln module in VulnDisco 9.0.  NOTE: as of 20100222, this disclosure has no actionable information. However, because the VulnDisco author is a reliable researcher, the issue is being assigned a CVE identifier for tracking purposes.
