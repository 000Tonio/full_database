# CVE-2010-1206

- Published: 2010-06-25T19:30:00

- Modified: 2017-09-19T01:30:00

The startDocumentLoad function in browser/base/content/browser.js in Mozilla Firefox 3.5.x before 3.5.11 and 3.6.x before 3.6.7, and SeaMonkey before 2.0.6, does not properly implement the Same Origin Policy in certain circumstances related to the about:blank document and a document that is currently loading, which allows (1) remote web servers to conduct spoofing attacks via vectors involving a 204 (aka No Content) status code, and allows (2) remote attackers to conduct spoofing attacks via vectors involving a window.stop call.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
