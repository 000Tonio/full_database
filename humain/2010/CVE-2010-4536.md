Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in KSES, as used in WordPress before 3.0.4, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors related to (1) the & (ampersand) character, (2) the case of an attribute name, (3) a padded entity, and (4) an entity that is not in normalized form.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
