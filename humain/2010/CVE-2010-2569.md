pubconv.dll (aka the Publisher Converter DLL) in Microsoft Publisher 2002 SP3, 2003 SP3, and 2007 SP2 does not properly handle an unspecified size field in certain older file formats, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) via a crafted Publisher file, aka "Size Value Heap Corruption in pubconv.dll Vulnerability."
