# CVE-2010-1643

- Published: 2010-06-03T14:30:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:19:00

mm/shmem.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.28-rc3, when strict overcommit is enabled, does not properly handle the export of shmemfs objects by knfsd, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and knfsd crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via unknown vectors.

### CVSS Score: **6.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
