# CVE-2010-1451

- Published: 2010-05-07T18:30:00

- Modified: 2020-08-14T15:46:00

The TSB I-TLB load implementation in arch/sparc/kernel/tsb.S in the Linux kernel before 2.6.33 on the SPARC platform does not properly obtain the value of a certain _PAGE_EXEC_4U bit and consequently does not properly implement a non-executable stack, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to exploit stack-based buffer overflows via a crafted application.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
