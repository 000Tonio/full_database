Sun Java System Web Server (aka SJWS) 7.0 Update 7 allows remote attackers to overwrite memory locations in the heap, and discover the contents of memory locations, via a malformed HTTP TRACE request that includes a long URI and many empty headers, related to an "overflow." NOTE: this might overlap CVE-2010-0272 and CVE-2010-0273.
