# CVE-2010-1129

- Published: 2010-03-26T20:30:00

- Modified: 2010-08-31T05:42:00

The safe_mode implementation in PHP before 5.2.13 does not properly handle directory pathnames that lack a trailing / (slash) character, which allows context-dependent attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via vectors related to use of the tempnam function.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
