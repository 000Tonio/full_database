The IKE implementation in Cisco IOS 12.2 through 12.4 on Cisco 7200 and 7301 routers with VAM2+ allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device reload) via a malformed IKE packet, aka Bug ID CSCtb13491. Per:http://www.cisco.com/en/US/products/products_security_advisory09186a0080b20ee5.shtml

'IPsec is an IP security feature that provides robust authentication and encryption of IP packets. IKE is a key management protocol standard that is used with the IPsec standard.

IKE is a hybrid protocol that implements the Oakley and SKEME key exchanges inside the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP) framework. (ISAKMP, Oakley, and SKEME are security protocols that are implemented by IKE.). More information on IKE is available at the following link:

http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/sec_secure_connectivity/configuration/guide/sec_key_exch_ipsec.html

A vulnerability exists in the Cisco IOS Software implementation of IKE where a malformed packet may cause a device running Cisco IOS Software to reload. Only Cisco 7200 Series and Cisco 7301 routers running Cisco IOS software with a VPN Acceleration Module 2+ (VAM2+) installed are affected.

This vulnerability is documented in Cisco Bug ID CSCtb13491 ( registered customers only) and has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2010-0578.'
