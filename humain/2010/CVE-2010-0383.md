Tor before 0.2.1.22, and 0.2.2.x before 0.2.2.7-alpha, uses deprecated identity keys for certain directory authorities, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to compromise the anonymity of traffic sources and destinations.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
