# CVE-2010-2755

- Published: 2010-07-30T13:26:00

- Modified: 2017-09-19T01:31:00

layout/generic/nsObjectFrame.cpp in Mozilla Firefox 3.6.7 does not properly free memory in the parameter array of a plugin instance, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted HTML document, related to the DATA and SRC attributes of an OBJECT element. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2010-1214.
