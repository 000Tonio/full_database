# CVE-2010-0622

- Published: 2010-02-15T18:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T19:53:00

The wake_futex_pi function in kernel/futex.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.33-rc7 does not properly handle certain unlock operations for a Priority Inheritance (PI) futex, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS) and possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors involving modification of the futex value from user space.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
