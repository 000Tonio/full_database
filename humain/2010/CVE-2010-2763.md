The XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper class in the SafeJSObjectWrapper (aka SJOW) implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 3.5.12, Thunderbird before 3.0.7, and SeaMonkey before 2.0.7 does not properly restrict scripted functions, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a crafted function.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
