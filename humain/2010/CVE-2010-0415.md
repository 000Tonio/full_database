# CVE-2010-0415

- Published: 2010-02-17T18:30:00

The do_pages_move function in mm/migrate.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.33-rc7 does not validate node values, which allows local users to read arbitrary kernel memory locations, cause a denial of service (OOPS), and possibly have unspecified other impact by specifying a node that is not part of the kernel's node set.
