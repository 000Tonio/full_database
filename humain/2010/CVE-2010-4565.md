The bcm_connect function in net/can/bcm.c (aka the Broadcast Manager) in the Controller Area Network (CAN) implementation in the Linux kernel 2.6.36 and earlier creates a publicly accessible file with a filename containing a kernel memory address, which allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive information about kernel memory use by listing this filename.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
