- Published: 2010-06-08T18:30:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:32:00

rpmbuild in RPM 4.8.0 and earlier does not properly parse the syntax of spec files, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to remove home directories via vectors involving a ;~ (semicolon tilde) sequence in a Name tag.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
