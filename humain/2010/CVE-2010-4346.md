# CVE-2010-4346

- Published: 2010-12-22T21:00:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:28:00

The install_special_mapping function in mm/mmap.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.37-rc6 does not make an expected security_file_mmap function call, which allows local users to bypass intended mmap_min_addr restrictions and possibly conduct NULL pointer dereference attacks via a crafted assembly-language application.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
