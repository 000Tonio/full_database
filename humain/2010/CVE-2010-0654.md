Mozilla Firefox 3.5.x before 3.5.11 and 3.6.x before 3.6.7, Thunderbird 3.0.x before 3.0.6 and 3.1.x before 3.1.1, and SeaMonkey before 2.0.6 permit cross-origin loading of CSS stylesheets even when the stylesheet download has an incorrect MIME type and the stylesheet document is malformed, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a crafted document.
