- Published: 2010-08-05T13:22:00

- Modified: 2010-08-05T13:22:00

The loginDefaultEncrypt algorithm in loginLib in Wind River VxWorks before 6.9 does not properly support a large set of distinct possible passwords, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access via a (1) telnet, (2) rlogin, or (3) FTP session.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |
