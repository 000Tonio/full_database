# CVE-2010-2251

- Published: 2010-07-06T17:17:00

The get1 command, as used by lftpget, in LFTP before 4.0.6 does not properly validate a server-provided filename before determining the destination filename of a download, which allows remote servers to create or overwrite arbitrary files via a Content-Disposition header that suggests a crafted filename, and possibly execute arbitrary code as a consequence of writing to a dotfile in a home directory.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
