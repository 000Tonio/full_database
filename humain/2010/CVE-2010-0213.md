# CVE-2010-0213

BIND 9.7.1 and 9.7.1-P1, when a recursive validating server has a trust anchor that is configured statically or via DNSSEC Lookaside Validation (DLV), allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a query for an RRSIG record whose answer is not in the cache, which causes BIND to repeatedly send RRSIG queries to the authoritative servers.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**
