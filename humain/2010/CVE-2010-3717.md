# CVE-2010-3717

- Published: 2010-10-25T20:01:00

- Modified: 2010-10-27T04:00:00

The t3lib_div::validEmail function in TYPO3 4.2.x before 4.2.15, 4.3.x before 4.3.7, and 4.4.x before 4.4.4 does not properly restrict input to filter_var FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL operations in PHP, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and application crash) via a long e-mail address string, a related issue to CVE-2010-3710.
