# CVE-2010-2074

- Published: 2010-06-16T20:30:00

- Modified: 2010-09-09T05:42:00

istream.c in w3m 0.5.2 and possibly other versions, when ssl_verify_server is enabled, does not properly handle a '\0' character in a domain name in the (1) subject's Common Name or (2) Subject Alternative Name field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a legitimate Certification Authority, a related issue to CVE-2009-2408.
