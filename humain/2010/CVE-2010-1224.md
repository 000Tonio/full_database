# CVE-2010-1224

- Published: 2010-04-01T21:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T19:56:00

main/acl.c in Asterisk Open Source 1.6.0.x before 1.6.0.25, 1.6.1.x before 1.6.1.17, and 1.6.2.x before 1.6.2.5 does not properly enforce remote host access controls when CIDR notation "/0" is used in permit= and deny= configuration rules, which causes an improper arithmetic shift and might allow remote attackers to bypass ACL rules and access services from unauthorized hosts.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
