Unspecified vulnerability in the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) in Oracle Java SE and Java for Business 6 Update 23 and earlier, and 5.0 Update 27 and earlier allows remote untrusted Java Web Start applications and untrusted Java applets to affect confidentiality via unknown vectors related to 2D.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the February 2011 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a downstream vendor that this issue is related to the exposure of system properties via vectors related to Font.createFont and exception text.
