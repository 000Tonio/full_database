The NetworkSyncCommandQueue function in network/network_command.cpp in OpenTTD before 1.0.3 does not properly clear a pointer in a linked list, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and CPU consumption) via a crafted request, related to the client command queue.

### CVSS Score: **5**
