# CVE-2010-4416

- Published: 2011-01-19T16:00:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:33:00

Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle GoldenGate Veridata component in Oracle Fusion Middleware 3.0.0.4 allows remote attackers to affect availability via unknown vectors related to Server.  NOTE: the previous information was obtained from the January 2011 CPU.  Oracle has not commented on claims from a reliable third party researcher that this is a buffer overflow via a crafted XML soap request and a value that does not contain the expected 0x20 terminator character.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
