The Accounts Preferences implementation in Apple Mac OS X 10.6 before 10.6.3, when a network account server is used, does not support Login Window access control that is based solely on group membership, which allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by entering login credentials. Per: http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4077

'This issue only affects systems configured to use a network account server, and does not affect systems prior to Mac OS X v10.6.'
