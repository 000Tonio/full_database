# CVE-2010-4805

- Published: 2011-05-26T16:55:00

- Modified: 2020-08-04T17:52:00

The socket implementation in net/core/sock.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.35 does not properly manage a backlog of received packets, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by sending a large amount of network traffic, related to the sk_add_backlog function and the sk_rmem_alloc socket field.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2010-4251.
