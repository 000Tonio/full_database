ISC DHCP server 4.2 before 4.2.0-P2, when configured to use failover partnerships, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (communications-interrupted state and DHCP client service loss) by connecting to a port that is only intended for a failover peer, as demonstrated by a Nagios check_tcp process check to TCP port 520.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |
