Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the Chaos Tool Suite (aka CTools) module 6.x before 6.x-1.4 for Drupal allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) enable a page via a q=admin/build/pages/nojs/enable/ value or (2) disable a page via a q=admin/build/pages/nojs/disable/ value.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
