Multiple integer overflows in real.c in the Real demuxer plugin in VideoLAN VLC Media Player before 1.1.6 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a zero i_subpackets value in a Real Media file, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow.
