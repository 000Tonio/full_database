Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in DiamondList 0.1.6, and possibly earlier, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) category[description] parameter to user/main/update_category, which is not properly handled by _app/views/categories/index.html.erb; and the (2) setting[site_title] parameter to user/main/update_settings, which is not properly handled by _app/views/settings/_list_settings.rhtml.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
