- Published: 2010-06-15T14:30:00

- Modified: 2010-06-16T04:00:00

The bookmarklet pop-up in the Bookmarks component in IBM Lotus Connections 2.5.x before 2.5.0.2 does not properly follow the "force SSL" setting, which might make it easier for remote attackers to obtain the cleartext of network communication by sniffing the network, or spoof arbitrary servers via a man-in-the-middle attack.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
