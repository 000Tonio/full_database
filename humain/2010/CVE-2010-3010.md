Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability on the HP 3Com OfficeConnect Gigabit VPN Firewall 3CREVF100-73 with firmware before 1.0.13 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: a separate XSS issue for HP System Management Homepage (SMH) was originally assigned CVE-2010-3010 due to a CNA error, but CVE-2010-3012 is the appropriate identifier for the SMH issue.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
