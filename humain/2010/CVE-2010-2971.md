# CVE-2010-2971

- Published: 2010-08-05T13:22:00

- Modified: 2018-01-05T02:29:00

loaders/load_it.c in libmikmod, possibly 3.1.12, does not properly account for the larger size of name##env relative to name##tick and name##node, which allows remote attackers to trigger a buffer over-read and possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted Impulse Tracker file, a related issue to CVE-2010-2546.  NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2009-3995.
