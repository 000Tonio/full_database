The ivtvfb_ioctl function in drivers/media/video/ivtv/ivtvfb.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36-rc8 does not properly initialize a certain structure member, which allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel stack memory via an FBIOGET_VBLANK ioctl call.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**
