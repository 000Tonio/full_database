Multiple integer overflows in libgdiplus 2.6.7, as used in Mono, allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a crafted TIFF file, related to the gdip_load_tiff_image function in tiffcodec.c; (2) a crafted JPEG file, related to the gdip_load_jpeg_image_internal function in jpegcodec.c; or (3) a crafted BMP file, related to the gdip_read_bmp_image function in bmpcodec.c, leading to heap-based buffer overflows.
