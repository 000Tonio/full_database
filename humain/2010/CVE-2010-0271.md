hald in Sun OpenSolaris snv_51 through snv_130 does not have the proc_audit privilege during unspecified attempts to write to the auditing log, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to avoid detection of changes to the set of connected hardware devices supporting the Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) specification.
