ISC BIND 9.0.x through 9.3.x, 9.4 before 9.4.3-P5, 9.5 before 9.5.2-P2, 9.6 before 9.6.1-P3, and 9.7.0 beta handles out-of-bailiwick data accompanying a secure response without re-fetching from the original source, which allows remote attackers to have an unspecified impact via a crafted response, aka Bug 20819.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of a regression during the fix for CVE-2009-4022.
