- Published: 2010-03-30T23:30:00

Directory traversal vulnerability in the JE Form Creator (com_jeformcr) component for Joomla!, when magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via directory traversal sequences in the view parameter to index.php. NOTE: the original researcher states that the affected product is JE Tooltip, not Form Creator; however, the exploit URL suggests that Form Creator is affected.
