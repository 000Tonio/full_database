# CVE-2010-2008

- Published: 2010-07-13T20:30:00

MySQL before 5.1.48 allows remote authenticated users with alter database privileges to cause a denial of service (server crash and database loss) via an ALTER DATABASE command with a #mysql50# string followed by a . (dot), .. (dot dot), ../ (dot dot slash) or similar sequence, and an UPGRADE DATA DIRECTORY NAME command, which causes MySQL to move certain directories to the server data directory.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
