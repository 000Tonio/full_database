The MMIO instruction decoder in the Xen hypervisor in the Linux kernel 2.6.18 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (32-bit guest OS crash) via vectors that trigger an unspecified instruction emulation. Per: http://secunia.com/advisories/39649

'Successful exploitation requires a 32bit system and access to an MMIO region.'
