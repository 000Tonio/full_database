# CVE-2010-0731

- Published: 2010-03-26T18:30:00

- Modified: 2017-09-19T01:30:00

The gnutls_x509_crt_get_serial function in the GnuTLS library before 1.2.1, when running on big-endian, 64-bit platforms, calls the asn1_read_value with a pointer to the wrong data type and the wrong length value, which allows remote attackers to bypass the certificate revocation list (CRL) check and cause a stack-based buffer overflow via a crafted X.509 certificate, related to extraction of a serial number. Per: http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.encryption.gpg.gnutls.devel/4230

"Please note that the problem was solved for GnuTLS 1.2.1, released on
2005-04-04.  Also, 32-bit platforms are not affected.  I have added
information about this on

http://www.gnu.org/software/gnutls/security.html

so that it contains the complete list of known security flaws.  I'm
using the keyword GNUTLS-SA-2010-1 for this."
