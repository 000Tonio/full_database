Mozilla Firefox 3.6 before 3.6.2 does not offer plugins the expected window.location protection mechanism, which might allow remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors that are specific to each affected plugin.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
