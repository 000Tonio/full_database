# CVE-2010-4334

- Published: 2011-01-14T01:00:00

- Modified: 2011-10-14T02:48:00

The IO::Socket::SSL module 1.35 for Perl, when verify_mode is not VERIFY_NONE, fails open to VERIFY_NONE instead of throwing an error when a ca_file/ca_path cannot be verified, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended certificate restrictions.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
