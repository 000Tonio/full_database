- Modified: 2018-10-12T21:56:00

Microsoft Office Visio 2002 SP2, 2003 SP3, and 2007 SP1 and SP2 does not properly calculate unspecified indexes associated with Visio files, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted file, aka "Visio Index Calculation Memory Corruption Vulnerability." Per: http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS10-028.mspx

'Users of Microsoft Office Visio 2002 and later versions of Visio will be prompted with Open, Save, or Cancel before opening a document. This is a mitigating factor because the vulnerability requires more than a single user action to complete the exploit.'
