# CVE-2010-0976

- Published: 2010-03-16T19:30:00

Acidcat CMS 3.5.x does not prevent access to install.asp after installation finishes, which might allow remote attackers to restart the installation process and have unspecified other impact via requests to install.asp and other install_*.asp scripts.  NOTE: the final installation screen states "Important: you must now delete all files beginning with 'install' from the root directory."
