The Connection Manager in IBM Lotus Mobile Connect before 6.1.4, when HTTP Access Services (HTTP-AS) is enabled, does not properly process TCP connection requests, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and HTTP-AS hang) by making many connection requests that trigger "queue size delta errors," related to a "timing hole" issue.
