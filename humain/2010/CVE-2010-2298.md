browser/renderer_host/database_dispatcher_host.cc in Google Chrome before 5.0.375.70 on Linux does not properly handle ViewHostMsg_DatabaseOpenFile messages in chroot-based sandboxing, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended sandbox restrictions via vectors involving fchdir and chdir calls.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
