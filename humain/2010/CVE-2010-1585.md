# CVE-2010-1585

- Published: 2010-04-28T22:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T19:57:00

The nsIScriptableUnescapeHTML.parseFragment method in the ParanoidFragmentSink protection mechanism in Mozilla Firefox before 3.5.17 and 3.6.x before 3.6.14, Thunderbird before 3.1.8, and SeaMonkey before 2.0.12 does not properly sanitize HTML in a chrome document, which makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges via a javascript: URI in input to an extension, as demonstrated by a javascript:alert sequence in (1) the HREF attribute of an A element or (2) the ACTION attribute of a FORM element.
