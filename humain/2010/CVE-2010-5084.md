The cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection mechanism in e107 before 0.7.23 uses a predictable random token based on the creation date of the administrator account, which allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that add new users via e107_admin/users.php.

### CVSS Score: **6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
