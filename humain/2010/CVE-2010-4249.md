# CVE-2010-4249

- Published: 2010-11-29T16:00:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:28:00

The wait_for_unix_gc function in net/unix/garbage.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.37-rc3-next-20101125 does not properly select times for garbage collection of inflight sockets, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system hang) via crafted use of the socketpair and sendmsg system calls for SOCK_SEQPACKET sockets.
