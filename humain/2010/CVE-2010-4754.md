The glob implementation in libc in FreeBSD 7.3 and 8.1, NetBSD 5.0.2, and OpenBSD 4.7, and Libsystem in Apple Mac OS X before 10.6.8, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via crafted glob expressions that do not match any pathnames, as demonstrated by glob expressions in STAT commands to an FTP daemon, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2632.
