The Word 97 text converter in the WordPad Text Converters in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3 and Server 2003 SP2 does not properly parse malformed structures in Word 97 documents, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted document containing an unspecified value that is used in a loop counter, aka "WordPad Word 97 Text Converter Memory Corruption Vulnerability."
