# CVE-2010-0296

- Published: 2010-06-01T20:30:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:21:00

The encode_name macro in misc/mntent_r.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.11.1 and earlier, as used by ncpmount and mount.cifs, does not properly handle newline characters in mountpoint names, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (mtab corruption), or possibly modify mount options and gain privileges, via a crafted mount request.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
