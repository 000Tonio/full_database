Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP1 and SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2, and Windows 7 allow local users to gain privileges by leveraging access to a process with NetworkService credentials, as demonstrated by TAPI Server, SQL Server, and IIS processes, and related to the Windows Service Isolation feature.  NOTE: the vendor states that privilege escalation from NetworkService to LocalSystem does not cross a "security boundary."

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
