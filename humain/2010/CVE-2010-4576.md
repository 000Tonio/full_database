browser/worker_host/message_port_dispatcher.cc in Google Chrome before 8.0.552.224 and Chrome OS before 8.0.552.343 does not properly handle certain postMessage calls, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via crafted JavaScript code that creates a web worker.
