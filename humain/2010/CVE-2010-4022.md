# CVE-2010-4022

- Published: 2011-02-10T18:00:00

- Modified: 2020-01-21T15:46:00

The do_standalone function in the MIT krb5 KDC database propagation daemon (kpropd) in Kerberos 1.7, 1.8, and 1.9, when running in standalone mode, does not properly handle when a worker child process "exits abnormally," which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (listening process termination, no new connections, and lack of updates in slave KVC) via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
