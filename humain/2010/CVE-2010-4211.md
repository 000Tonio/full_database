# CVE-2010-4211

- Published: 2010-11-09T01:00:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:33:00

The PayPal app before 3.0.1 for iOS does not verify that the server hostname matches the domain name of the subject of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof a PayPal web server via an arbitrary certificate.

### CVSS Score: **2.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
