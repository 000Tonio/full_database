# CVE-2010-0727

- Published: 2010-03-16T19:30:00

- Modified: 2020-08-07T15:13:00

The gfs2_lock function in the Linux kernel before 2.6.34-rc1-next-20100312, and the gfs_lock function in the Linux kernel on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 and 6, does not properly remove POSIX locks on files that are setgid without group-execute permission, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (BUG and system crash) by locking a file on a (1) GFS or (2) GFS2 filesystem, and then changing this file's permissions.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
