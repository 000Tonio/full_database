A certain Fedora patch for gif2png.c in gif2png 2.5.1 and 2.5.2, as distributed in gif2png-2.5.1-1200.fc12 on Fedora 12 and gif2png_2.5.2-1 on Debian GNU/Linux, truncates a GIF pathname specified on the command line, which might allow remote attackers to create PNG files in unintended directories via a crafted command-line argument, as demonstrated by a CGI program that launches gif2png, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-5018.
