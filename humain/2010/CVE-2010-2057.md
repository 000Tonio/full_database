# CVE-2010-2057

- Published: 2010-10-20T18:00:00

- Modified: 2010-11-19T05:00:00

shared/util/StateUtils.java in Apache MyFaces 1.1.x before 1.1.8, 1.2.x before 1.2.9, and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 uses an encrypted View State without a Message Authentication Code (MAC), which makes it easier for remote attackers to perform successful modifications of the View State via a padding oracle attack.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
