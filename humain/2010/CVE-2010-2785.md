The IRC Protocol component in KVIrc 3.x and 4.x before r4693 does not properly handle \ (backslash) characters, which allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary CTCP commands via vectors involving \r and \40 sequences, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2451 and CVE-2010-2452.

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
