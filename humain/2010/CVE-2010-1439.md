# CVE-2010-1439

yum-rhn-plugin in Red Hat Network Client Tools (aka rhn-client-tools) on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 and Fedora uses world-readable permissions for the /var/spool/up2date/loginAuth.pkl file, which allows local users to access the Red Hat Network profile, and possibly prevent future security updates, by leveraging authentication data from this file.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
