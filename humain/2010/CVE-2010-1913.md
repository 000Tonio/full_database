# CVE-2010-1913

- Published: 2010-05-12T11:46:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T19:58:00

The default configuration of pluginlicense.ini for the SdcWebSecureBase interface in tgctlcm.dll in Consona Live Assistance, Dynamic Agent, and Subscriber Assistance, when downloaded from a server operated by Telefonica or possibly other companies, contains an incorrect DNS whitelist that includes the DNS hostnames of home computers of many persons, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended restrictions on ActiveX execution by hosting an ActiveX control on an applicable home web server.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**
