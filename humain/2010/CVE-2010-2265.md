- Published: 2010-06-15T14:04:00

- Modified: 2019-02-26T14:04:00

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the GetServerName function in sysinfo/commonFunc.js in Microsoft Windows Help and Support Center for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the svr parameter to sysinfo/sysinfomain.htm.  NOTE: this can be leveraged with CVE-2010-1885 to execute arbitrary commands without user interaction. Per: http://blogs.technet.com/b/msrc/archive/2010/06/10/windows-help-vulnerability-disclosure.aspx

"customers running Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008, and Windows Server 2008 R2, are not vulnerable to this issue, or at risk of attack."
