# CVE-2010-5290

- Published: 2013-09-20T16:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:29:00

The authentication process in Adobe ColdFusion before 10 does not require knowledge of the cleartext password if the password hash is known, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain administrative privileges by leveraging read access to the configuration file, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2861. The CVSS score reflects previously published information indicating successful exploitation allows SYSTEM access on certain operating systems.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
