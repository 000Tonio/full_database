Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in SquirrelMail 1.4.21 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving (1) drop-down selection lists, (2) the > (greater than) character in the SquirrelSpell spellchecking plugin, and (3) errors associated with the Index Order (aka options_order) page.

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
