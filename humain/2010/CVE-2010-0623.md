# CVE-2010-0623

- Published: 2010-02-15T18:30:00

- Modified: 2020-08-14T15:45:00

The futex_lock_pi function in kernel/futex.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.33-rc7 does not properly manage a certain reference count, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS) via vectors involving an unmount of an ext3 filesystem.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
