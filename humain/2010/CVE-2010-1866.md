# CVE-2010-1866

The dechunk filter in PHP 5.3 through 5.3.2, when decoding an HTTP chunked encoding stream, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly trigger memory corruption via a negative chunk size, which bypasses a signed comparison, related to an integer overflow in the chunk size decoder.
