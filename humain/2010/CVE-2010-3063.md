# CVE-2010-3063

- Published: 2010-08-20T20:00:00

- Modified: 2010-12-07T06:50:00

The php_mysqlnd_read_error_from_line function in the Mysqlnd extension in PHP 5.3 through 5.3.2 does not properly calculate a buffer length, which allows context-dependent attackers to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow via crafted inputs that cause a negative length value to be used.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
