** DISPUTED ** In the Linux kernel before 2.6.34, a range check issue in drivers/gpu/drm/radeon/atombios.c could cause an off by one (buffer overflow) problem. NOTE: At least one Linux maintainer believes that this CVE is incorrectly assigned and should be rejected because the value is hard coded and are not user-controllable where it is used.
