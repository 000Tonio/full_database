Android OS before 2.2 does not display the correct SSL certificate in certain cases, which might allow remote attackers to spoof trusted web sites via a web page containing references to external sources in which (1) the certificate of the last loaded resource is checked, instead of for the main page, or (2) later certificates are not checked when the HTTPS connection is reused.
