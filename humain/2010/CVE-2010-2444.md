parse/Csv2_parse.c in MaraDNS 1.3.03, and other versions before 1.4.03, does not properly handle hostnames that do not end in a "." (dot) character, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via a crafted csv2 zone file. Per: http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html

'NULL Pointer Dereference'
