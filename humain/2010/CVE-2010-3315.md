# CVE-2010-3315

- Published: 2010-10-04T21:00:00

- Modified: 2017-09-19T01:31:00

authz.c in the mod_dav_svn module for the Apache HTTP Server, as distributed in Apache Subversion 1.5.x before 1.5.8 and 1.6.x before 1.6.13, when SVNPathAuthz short_circuit is enabled, does not properly handle a named repository as a rule scope, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via svn commands.

### CVSS Score: **6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
