- Published: 2010-03-31T18:00:00

- Modified: 2013-09-13T06:30:00

thumb.php in MediaWiki before 1.15.2, when used with access-restriction mechanisms such as img_auth.php, does not check user permissions before providing scaled images, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and read private images via unspecified manipulations.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
