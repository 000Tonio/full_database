The CSSLoaderImpl::DoSheetComplete function in layout/style/nsCSSLoader.cpp in Mozilla Firefox 3.0.x before 3.0.18, 3.5.x before 3.5.8, and 3.6.x before 3.6.2; Thunderbird before 3.0.2; and SeaMonkey before 2.0.3 changes the case of certain strings in a stylesheet before adding this stylesheet to the XUL cache, which might allow remote attackers to modify the browser's font and other CSS attributes, and potentially disrupt rendering of a web page, by forcing the browser to perform this erroneous stylesheet caching.
