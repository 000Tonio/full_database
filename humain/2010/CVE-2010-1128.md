# CVE-2010-1128

- Published: 2010-03-26T20:30:00

- Modified: 2010-12-10T06:39:00

The Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) in PHP before 5.2.13 does not provide the expected entropy, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to guess values that were intended to be unpredictable, as demonstrated by session cookies generated by using the uniqid function.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |
