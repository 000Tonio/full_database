# CVE-2010-0295

- Published: 2010-02-03T19:30:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:31:00

lighttpd before 1.4.26, and 1.5.x, allocates a buffer for each read operation that occurs for a request, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by breaking a request into small pieces that are sent at a slow rate.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
