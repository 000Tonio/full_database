# CVE-2010-3477

- Published: 2010-09-21T20:00:00

- Modified: 2020-08-14T14:03:00

The tcf_act_police_dump function in net/sched/act_police.c in the actions implementation in the network queueing functionality in the Linux kernel before 2.6.36-rc4 does not properly initialize certain structure members, which allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory via vectors involving a dump operation.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2010-2942.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
