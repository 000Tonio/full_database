- Modified: 2010-09-30T04:00:00

The OpenID module in Drupal 6.x before 6.18, and the OpenID module 5.x before 5.x-1.4 for Drupal, violates the OpenID 2.0 protocol by not ensuring that fields are signed, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by leveraging an assertion from an OpenID provider.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
