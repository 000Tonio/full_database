# CVE-2010-3618

- Published: 2010-11-22T13:00:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:33:00

PGP Desktop 10.0.x before 10.0.3 SP2 and 10.1.0 before 10.1.0 SP1 does not properly implement the "Decrypt/Verify File via Right-Click" functionality for multi-packet OpenPGP messages that represent multi-message input, which allows remote attackers to spoof signed data by concatenating an additional message to the end of a legitimately signed message, related to a "piggy-back" or "unsigned data injection" issue.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
