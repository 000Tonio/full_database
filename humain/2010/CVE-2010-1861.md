The sysvshm extension for PHP 5.2 through 5.2.13 and 5.3 through 5.3.2 allows context-dependent attackers to write to arbitrary memory addresses by using an object's __sleep function to interrupt an internal call to the shm_put_var function, which triggers access of a freed resource.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**
