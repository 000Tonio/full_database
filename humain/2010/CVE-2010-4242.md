# CVE-2010-4242

- Published: 2011-01-11T03:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T20:07:00

The hci_uart_tty_open function in the HCI UART driver (drivers/bluetooth/hci_ldisc.c) in the Linux kernel 2.6.36, and possibly other versions, does not verify whether the tty has a write operation, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via vectors related to the Bluetooth driver. Per: http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html

'CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference'

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
