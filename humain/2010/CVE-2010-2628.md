# CVE-2010-2628

- Published: 2010-08-20T18:00:00

- Modified: 2010-08-24T05:46:00

The IKE daemon in strongSwan 4.3.x before 4.3.7 and 4.4.x before 4.4.1 does not properly check the return values of snprintf calls, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted (1) certificate or (2) identity data that triggers buffer overflows.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
