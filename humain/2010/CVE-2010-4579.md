- Published: 2010-12-22T03:00:00

- Modified: 2011-01-22T06:45:00

Opera before 11.00 does not properly constrain dialogs to appear on top of rendered documents, which makes it easier for remote attackers to trick users into interacting with a crafted web site that spoofs the (1) security information dialog or (2) download dialog.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
