The dirapi.dll module in Adobe Shockwave Player before 11.5.9.620 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via a Director movie with an IFWV chunk with a size field of 0, which is used in the calculation of a file offset and causes invalid data to be used as a loop counter, triggering a heap-based buffer overflow, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2587 and CVE-2010-2588.
