The user interface in Microsoft Cluster Service (MSCS) in Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 does not properly set administrative-share permissions for new cluster disks that are shared as part of a failover cluster, which allows remote attackers to read or modify data on these disks via requests to the associated share, aka "Permissions on New Cluster Disks Vulnerability."
