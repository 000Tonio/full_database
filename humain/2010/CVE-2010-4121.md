- Published: 2010-10-28T21:00:00

- Modified: 2010-10-29T04:00:00

** DISPUTED ** The TCP-to-ODBC gateway in IBM Tivoli Provisioning Manager for OS Deployment 7.1.1.3 does not require authentication for SQL statements, which allows remote attackers to modify, create, or read database records via a session on TCP port 2020.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating that the "default Microsoft Access database is not password protected because it is intended to be used for evaluation purposes only."

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
