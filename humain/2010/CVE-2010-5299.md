# CVE-2010-5299

- Published: 2014-05-23T00:55:00

- Modified: 2014-06-30T18:07:00

Stack-based buffer overflow in MicroP 0.1.1.1600 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted .mppl file.  NOTE: it has been reported that the overflow is in the lpFileName parameter of the CreateFileA function, but the overflow is probably caused by a separate, unnamed function.
