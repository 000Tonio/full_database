Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the apache2-slms package in SUSE Lifecycle Management Server (SLMS) 1.0 on SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) 11 allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of unspecified victims via vectors related to improper parameter quoting.  NOTE: some sources report that this is a vulnerability in a product named "Apache SLMS," but that is incorrect.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
