The audit facility in the Security component in IBM DB2 UDB 9.5 before FP6a uses instance-level audit settings to capture connection (aka CONNECT and AUTHENTICATION) events in certain circumstances in which database-level audit settings were intended, which might make it easier for remote attackers to connect without discovery.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
