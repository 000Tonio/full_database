# CVE-2010-3696

- Published: 2010-10-07T21:00:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:25:00

The fr_dhcp_decode function in lib/dhcp.c in FreeRADIUS 2.1.9, in certain non-default builds, does not properly handle the DHCP Relay Agent Information option, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and daemon outage) via a packet that has more than one sub-option. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
