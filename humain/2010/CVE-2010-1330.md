# CVE-2010-1330

- Published: 2012-11-23T19:55:00

- Modified: 2021-01-12T14:46:00

The regular expression engine in JRuby before 1.4.1, when $KCODE is set to 'u', does not properly handle characters immediately after a UTF-8 character, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a crafted string.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
