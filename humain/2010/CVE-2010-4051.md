# CVE-2010-4051

- Published: 2011-01-13T19:00:00

- Modified: 2021-06-18T15:15:00

The regcomp implementation in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) through 2.11.3, and 2.12.x through 2.12.2, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a regular expression containing adjacent bounded repetitions that bypass the intended RE_DUP_MAX limitation, as demonstrated by a {10,}{10,}{10,}{10,}{10,} sequence in the proftpd.gnu.c exploit for ProFTPD, related to a "RE_DUP_MAX overflow."

### CVSS Score: **5**
