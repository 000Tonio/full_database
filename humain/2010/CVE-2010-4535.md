# CVE-2010-4535

- Published: 2011-01-10T20:00:00

- Modified: 2011-01-20T06:46:00

The password reset functionality in django.contrib.auth in Django before 1.1.3, 1.2.x before 1.2.4, and 1.3.x before 1.3 beta 1 does not validate the length of a string representing a base36 timestamp, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via a URL that specifies a large base36 integer.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
