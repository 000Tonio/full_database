- Published: 2010-02-12T19:30:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:15:00

The pit_ioport_read function in the Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) emulation in i8254.c in KVM 83 does not properly use the pit_state data structure, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash or hang) by attempting to read the /dev/port file.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| --- | --- | --- |
