- Published: 2010-11-06T00:00:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:26:00

The default configuration of Luci 0.22.4 and earlier in Red Hat Conga uses "[INSERT SECRET HERE]" as its secret key for cookies, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass repoze.who authentication via a forged ticket cookie.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
