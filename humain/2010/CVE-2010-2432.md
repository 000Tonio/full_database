# CVE-2010-2432

- Published: 2010-06-22T20:30:00

- Modified: 2013-05-15T03:10:00

The cupsDoAuthentication function in auth.c in the client in CUPS before 1.4.4, when HAVE_GSSAPI is omitted, does not properly handle a demand for authorization, which allows remote CUPS servers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED responses.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
