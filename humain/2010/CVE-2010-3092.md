# CVE-2010-3092

- Published: 2010-09-21T20:00:00

- Modified: 2010-09-22T04:00:00

The upload module in Drupal 5.x before 5.23 and 6.x before 6.18 does not properly support case-insensitive filename handling in a database configuration, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass the intended restrictions on downloading a file by uploading a different file with a similar name.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
