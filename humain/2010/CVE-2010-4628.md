# CVE-2010-4628

- Published: 2010-12-30T21:00:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:33:00

member.php in MyBB (aka MyBulletinBoard) before 1.4.12 makes a certain superfluous call to the SQL COUNT function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) by making requests to member.php that trigger scans of the entire users table.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
