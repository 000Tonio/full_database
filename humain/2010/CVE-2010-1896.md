The Windows kernel-mode drivers in win32k.sys in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP1 and SP2, and Windows Server 2008 Gold and SP2 do not properly validate user-mode input passed to kernel mode, which allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted application, aka "Win32k User Input Validation Vulnerability."
