The _WriteProlog function in texttops.c in texttops in the Text Filter subsystem in CUPS before 1.4.4 does not check the return values of certain calloc calls, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference or heap memory corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted file.
