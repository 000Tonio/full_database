# CVE-2010-0397

- Published: 2010-03-16T19:30:00

- Modified: 2010-12-10T06:37:00

The xmlrpc extension in PHP 5.3.1 does not properly handle a missing methodName element in the first argument to the xmlrpc_decode_request function, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) and possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted argument. Per: http://cwe.mitre.org/data/slices/2000.html

Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions CWE-754

### CVSS Score: **5**
