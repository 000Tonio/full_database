# CVE-2010-4527

- Published: 2011-01-13T19:00:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:28:00

The load_mixer_volumes function in sound/oss/soundcard.c in the OSS sound subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.37 incorrectly expects that a certain name field ends with a '\0' character, which allows local users to conduct buffer overflow attacks and gain privileges, or possibly obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, via a SOUND_MIXER_SETLEVELS ioctl call.

### CVSS Score: **6.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
