# CVE-2010-1728

- Published: 2010-05-06T14:53:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:26:00

Opera before 10.53 on Windows and Mac OS X does not properly handle a series of document modifications that occur asynchronously, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash) via JavaScript that writes <marquee> sequences in an infinite loop, leading to attempted use of uninitialized memory.  NOTE: this might overlap CVE-2006-6955.
