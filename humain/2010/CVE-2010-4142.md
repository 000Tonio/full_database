# CVE-2010-4142

- Published: 2010-11-02T02:26:00

- Modified: 2010-11-04T04:00:00

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in DATAC RealWin 2.0 Build 6.1.8.10 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long (1) SCPC_INITIALIZE, (2) SCPC_INITIALIZE_RF, or (3) SCPC_TXTEVENT packet. NOTE: it was later reported that 1.06 is also affected by one of these requests. http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2010/2714
