# CVE-2010-4255

- Published: 2011-01-25T01:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T20:07:00

The fixup_page_fault function in arch/x86/traps.c in Xen 4.0.1 and earlier on 64-bit platforms, when paravirtualization is enabled, does not verify that kernel mode is used to call the handle_gdt_ldt_mapping_fault function, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS BUG_ON) via a crafted memory access.

### CVSS Score: **6.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
