- Modified: 2012-03-19T04:00:00

The proc_oom_score function in fs/proc/base.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.34-rc4 uses inappropriate data structures during selection of a candidate for the OOM killer, which might allow local users to cause a denial of service via unspecified patterns of task creation.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
