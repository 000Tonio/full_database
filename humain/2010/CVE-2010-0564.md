Buffer overflow in Trend Micro URL Filtering Engine (TMUFE) in OfficeScan 8.0 before SP1 Patch 5 - Build 3510, possibly tmufeng.dll before 3.0.0.1029, allows attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or OfficeScan hang) via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: it is likely that this issue also affects tmufeng.dll before 2.0.0.1049 for OfficeScan 10.0.
