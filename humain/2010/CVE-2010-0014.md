# CVE-2010-0014

- Published: 2010-01-14T18:30:00

System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) before 1.0.1, when the krb5 auth_provider is configured but the KDC is unreachable, allows physically proximate attackers to authenticate, via an arbitrary password, to the screen-locking program on a workstation that has any user's Kerberos ticket-granting ticket (TGT); and might allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via vectors involving an arbitrary password in conjunction with a valid TGT.

### CVSS Score: **3.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
