# CVE-2010-2951

- Published: 2010-10-12T21:00:00

- Modified: 2010-10-13T04:00:00

dns_internal.cc in Squid 3.1.6, when IPv6 DNS resolution is not enabled, accesses an invalid socket during an IPv4 TCP DNS query, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via vectors that trigger an IPv4 DNS response with the TC bit set.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
