# CVE-2010-2295

- Published: 2010-06-15T18:00:00

- Modified: 2020-08-05T18:18:00

page/EventHandler.cpp in WebCore in WebKit in Google Chrome before 5.0.375.70 does not properly handle a change of the focused frame during the dispatching of keydown, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to redirect keystrokes via a crafted HTML document, aka rdar problem 7018610.  NOTE: this might overlap CVE-2010-1422.
