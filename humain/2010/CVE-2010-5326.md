- Published: 2016-05-13T10:59:00

- Modified: 2021-04-20T18:41:00

The Invoker Servlet on SAP NetWeaver Application Server Java platforms, possibly before 7.3, does not require authentication, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an HTTP or HTTPS request, as exploited in the wild in 2013 through 2016, aka a "Detour" attack.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
