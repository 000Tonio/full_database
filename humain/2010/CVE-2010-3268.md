The GetStringAMSHandler function in prgxhndl.dll in hndlrsvc.exe in the Intel Alert Handler service (aka Symantec Intel Handler service) in Intel Alert Management System (AMS), as used in Symantec Antivirus Corporate Edition 10.1.4.4010 on Windows 2000 SP4 and Symantec Endpoint Protection before 11.x, does not properly validate the CommandLine field of an AMS request, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted request.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
