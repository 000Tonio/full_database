The browser in Research In Motion (RIM) BlackBerry Device Software 5.0.0.593 Platform 5.1.0.147 on the BlackBerry 9700 does not properly restrict cross-domain execution of JavaScript, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via vectors related to a window.open call and an IFRAME element.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
