Mozilla Firefox before 3.5.9 and 3.6.x before 3.6.2, and SeaMonkey before 2.0.4, executes a mail application in situations where an IMG element has a SRC attribute that is a redirect to a mailto: URL, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (excessive application launches) via an HTML document with many images.
