- Modified: 2013-04-19T02:58:00

client/mount.cifs.c in mount.cifs in smbfs in Samba 3.4.5 and earlier does not verify that the (1) device name and (2) mountpoint strings are composed of valid characters, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (mtab corruption) via a crafted string.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |
