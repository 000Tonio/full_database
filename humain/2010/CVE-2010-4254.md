Mono, when Moonlight before 2.3.0.1 or 2.99.x before 2.99.0.10 is used, does not properly validate arguments to generic methods, which allows remote attackers to bypass generic constraints, and possibly execute arbitrary code, via a crafted method call.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| --- | --- | --- |
