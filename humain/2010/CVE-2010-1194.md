The match_component function in smtp-tls.c in libESMTP 1.0.3.r1, and possibly other versions including 1.0.4, treats two strings as equal if one is a substring of the other, which allows remote attackers to spoof trusted certificates via a crafted subjectAltName.

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
