JBoss Seam 2 (jboss-seam2), as used in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 4.3.0 for Red Hat Linux, does not properly sanitize inputs for JBoss Expression Language (EL) expressions, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted URL.  NOTE: this is only a vulnerability when the Java Security Manager is not properly configured.
