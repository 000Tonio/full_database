The Web Services Security component in IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) 7.0 before 7.0.0.13 does not properly implement the Java API for XML Web Services (aka JAX-WS), which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (data corruption) via a crafted JAX-WS request that leads to incorrectly encoded data.
