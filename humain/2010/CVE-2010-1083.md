# CVE-2010-1083

- Published: 2010-04-06T22:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T19:55:00

The processcompl_compat function in drivers/usb/core/devio.c in Linux kernel 2.6.x through 2.6.32, and possibly other versions, does not clear the transfer buffer before returning to userspace when a USB command fails, which might make it easier for physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive information (kernel memory).

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
