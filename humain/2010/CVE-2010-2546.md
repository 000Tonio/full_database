- Published: 2010-08-05T13:22:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T03:17:00

Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in loaders/load_it.c in libmikmod, possibly 3.1.12, might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) crafted samples or (2) crafted instrument definitions in an Impulse Tracker file, related to panpts, pitpts, and IT_ProcessEnvelope. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2009-3995.
