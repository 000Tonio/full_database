The TIFFReadDirectory function in LibTIFF 3.9.0 does not properly validate the data types of codec-specific tags that have an out-of-order position in a TIFF file, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted file, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2481.
