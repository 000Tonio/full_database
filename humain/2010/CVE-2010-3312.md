Epiphany 2.28 and 2.29, when WebKit and LibSoup are used, unconditionally displays a closed-lock icon for any URL beginning with the https: substring, without any warning to the user, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary https web sites via a crafted X.509 server certificate.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
