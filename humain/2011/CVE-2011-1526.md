ftpd.c in the GSS-API FTP daemon in MIT Kerberos Version 5 Applications (aka krb5-appl) 1.0.1 and earlier does not check the krb5_setegid return value, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended group access restrictions, and create, overwrite, delete, or read files, via standard FTP commands, related to missing autoconf tests in a configure script.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
