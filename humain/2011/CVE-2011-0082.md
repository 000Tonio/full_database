# CVE-2011-0082

- Published: 2011-06-06T19:55:00

The X.509 certificate validation functionality in Mozilla Firefox 4.0.x through 4.0.1 does not properly implement single-session security exceptions, which might make it easier for user-assisted remote attackers to spoof an SSL server via an untrusted certificate that triggers potentially unwanted local caching of documents from that server.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
