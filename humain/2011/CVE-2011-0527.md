- Published: 2011-08-15T19:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:33:00

VMware vFabric tc Server (aka SpringSource tc Server) 2.0.x before 2.0.6.RELEASE and 2.1.x before 2.1.2.RELEASE accepts obfuscated passwords during JMX authentication, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain access by leveraging an ability to read stored passwords.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
