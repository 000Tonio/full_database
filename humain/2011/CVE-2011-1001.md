# CVE-2011-1001

- Published: 2011-07-08T17:55:00

- Modified: 2011-09-07T03:15:00

dexdump in Android SDK before 2.3 does not properly perform structural verification, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (dexdump crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a malformed APK or dex file that calls a method using more arguments than the number of register that have been declared for that method.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
