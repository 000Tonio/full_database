Parallels Plesk Small Business Panel 10.2.0 generates web pages containing external links in response to GET requests with query strings for client@1/domain@1/hosting/file-manager/ and certain other files, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading (1) web-server access logs or (2) web-server Referer logs, related to a "cross-domain Referer leakage" issue.

### CVSS Score: **5**
