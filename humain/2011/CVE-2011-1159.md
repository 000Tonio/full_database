# CVE-2011-1159

- Published: 2011-10-05T02:56:00

- Modified: 2012-05-14T04:00:00

acpid.c in acpid before 2.0.9 does not properly handle a situation in which a process has connected to acpid.socket but is not reading any data, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (daemon hang) via a crafted application that performs a connect system call but no read system calls.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
