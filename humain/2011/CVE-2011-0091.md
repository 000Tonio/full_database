Kerberos in Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 does not prevent a session from changing from strong encryption to DES encryption, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof network traffic and obtain sensitive information via a DES downgrade, aka "Kerberos Spoofing Vulnerability."
