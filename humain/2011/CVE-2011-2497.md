# CVE-2011-2497

- Published: 2011-08-29T18:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T01:19:00

Integer underflow in the l2cap_config_req function in net/bluetooth/l2cap_core.c in the Linux kernel before 3.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a small command-size value within the command header of a Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) configuration request, leading to a buffer overflow.
