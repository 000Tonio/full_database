- Published: 2011-01-20T19:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-09T19:29:00

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in VaM Shop 1.6, 1.6.1, and probably earlier versions allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) change user status via admin/customers.php or (2) change user permissions via admin/accounting.php.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
