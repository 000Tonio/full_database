# CVE-2011-1499

- Published: 2011-04-29T22:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:34:00

acl.c in Tinyproxy before 1.8.3, when an Allow configuration setting specifies a CIDR block, permits TCP connections from all IP addresses, which makes it easier for remote attackers to hide the origin of web traffic by leveraging the open HTTP proxy server.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
