# CVE-2011-4131

- Published: 2012-05-17T11:00:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:32:00

The NFSv4 implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.2 does not properly handle bitmap sizes in GETACL replies, which allows remote NFS servers to cause a denial of service (OOPS) by sending an excessive number of bitmap words.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
