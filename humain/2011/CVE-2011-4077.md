Buffer overflow in the xfs_readlink function in fs/xfs/xfs_vnodeops.c in XFS in the Linux kernel 2.6, when CONFIG_XFS_DEBUG is disabled, allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via an XFS image containing a symbolic link with a long pathname.
