# CVE-2011-1928

- Published: 2011-05-24T23:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:30:00

The fnmatch implementation in apr_fnmatch.c in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library 1.4.3 and 1.4.4, and the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.18, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a URI that does not match unspecified types of wildcard patterns, as demonstrated by attacks against mod_autoindex in httpd when a /*/WEB-INF/ configuration pattern is used. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2011-0419.
