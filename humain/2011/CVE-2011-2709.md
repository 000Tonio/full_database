- Published: 2012-06-21T15:55:00

- Modified: 2013-03-02T04:33:00

libgssapi and libgssglue before 0.4 do not properly check privileges, which allows local users to load untrusted configuration files and execute arbitrary code via the GSSAPI_MECH_CONF environment variable, as demonstrated using mount.nfs.

### CVSS Score: **6.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
