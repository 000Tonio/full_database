# CVE-2011-0064

- Published: 2011-03-07T21:00:00

- Modified: 2021-07-14T15:41:00

The hb_buffer_ensure function in hb-buffer.c in HarfBuzz, as used in Pango 1.28.3, Firefox, and other products, does not verify that memory reallocations succeed, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted OpenType font data that triggers use of an incorrect index.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
