The drag-and-drop implementation in Google Chrome before 13.0.782.107 on Linux does not properly enforce permissions for files, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
