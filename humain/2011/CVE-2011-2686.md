# CVE-2011-2686

- Published: 2011-08-05T21:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T01:20:00

Ruby before 1.8.7-p352 does not reset the random seed upon forking, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to predict the values of random numbers by leveraging knowledge of the number sequence obtained in a different child process, a related issue to CVE-2003-0900. NOTE: this issue exists because of a regression during Ruby 1.8.6 development.
