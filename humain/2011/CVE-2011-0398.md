# CVE-2011-0398

- Published: 2011-01-10T20:00:00

- Modified: 2019-11-21T13:30:00

The Piwik_Common::getIP function in Piwik before 1.1 does not properly determine the client IP address, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended geolocation and logging functionality via (1) use of a private (aka RFC 1918) address behind a proxy server or (2) spoofing of the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
