Mozilla Firefox before 3.6.25 and Thunderbird before 3.1.17 on Mac OS X do not consider .jar files to be executable files, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a crafted file.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2011-2372 on Mac OS X.
