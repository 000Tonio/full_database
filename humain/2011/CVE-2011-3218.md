The "Save for Web" selection in QuickTime Player in Apple Mac OS X through 10.6.8 exports HTML documents that contain an http link to a script file, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by spoofing the http server during local viewing of an exported document.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**
