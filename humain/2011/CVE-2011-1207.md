The ActiveBar1 ActiveX control in the Data Dynamics ActiveBar ActiveX controls, as distributed in ActBar.ocx 1.0.6.5 in IBM Rational System Architect 11.4.0.2, 11.4.0.1, and earlier, does not properly restrict the SetLayoutData method, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted Data argument, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-3883.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
