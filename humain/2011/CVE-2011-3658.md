# CVE-2011-3658

- Published: 2011-12-21T04:02:00

- Modified: 2017-12-29T02:29:00

The SVG implementation in Mozilla Firefox 8.0, Thunderbird 8.0, and SeaMonkey 2.5 does not properly interact with DOMAttrModified event handlers, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds memory access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors involving removal of SVG elements.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
