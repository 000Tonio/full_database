The SmarterTools SmarterStats 6.0 web server generates web pages containing external links in response to GET requests with query strings for (1) Client/frmViewReports.aspx or (2) UserControls/Popups/frmHelp.aspx, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading (a) web-server access logs or (b) web-server Referer logs, related to a "cross-domain Referer leakage" issue.
