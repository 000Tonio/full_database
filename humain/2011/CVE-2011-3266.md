The proto_tree_add_item function in Wireshark 1.6.0 through 1.6.1 and 1.4.0 through 1.4.8, when the IKEv1 protocol dissector is used, allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via vectors involving a malformed IKE packet and many items in a tree.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
