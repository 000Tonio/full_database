The Mobility Pack before 1.2 in Novell Data Synchronizer 1.x through 1.1.2 build 428 does not include the HTTPOnly flag in a Set-Cookie header, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
