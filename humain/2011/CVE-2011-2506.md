# CVE-2011-2506

- Published: 2011-07-14T23:55:00

- Modified: 2018-10-09T19:32:00

setup/lib/ConfigGenerator.class.php in phpMyAdmin 3.x before 3.3.10.2 and 3.4.x before 3.4.3.1 does not properly restrict the presence of comment closing delimiters, which allows remote attackers to conduct static code injection attacks by leveraging the ability to modify the SESSION superglobal array.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
