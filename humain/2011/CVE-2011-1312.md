The Administrative Console component in IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) 6.1.0.x before 6.1.0.31 and 7.x before 7.0.0.15 does not prevent modifications of the primary admin id, which allows remote authenticated administrators to bypass intended access restrictions by mapping a (1) user or (2) group to an administrator role.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
