- Published: 2011-04-08T15:17:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T01:18:00

Multiple untrusted search path vulnerabilities in elf/dl-object.c in certain modified versions of the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6), including glibc-2.5-49.el5_5.6 and glibc-2.12-1.7.el6_0.3 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, allow local users to gain privileges via a crafted dynamic shared object (DSO) in a subdirectory of the current working directory during execution of a (1) setuid or (2) setgid program that has $ORIGIN in (a) RPATH or (b) RUNPATH within the program itself or a referenced library. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2010-3847.
