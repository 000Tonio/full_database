# CVE-2011-2710

- Published: 2011-07-27T20:55:00

- Modified: 2018-08-13T21:47:00

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Joomla! before 1.7.0 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the URI to includes/application.php, reachable through index.php; and, when Internet Explorer or Konqueror is used, (2) allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the searchword parameter in a search action to index.php in the com_search component.  NOTE: vector 2 exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-2509.5.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
