# CVE-2011-0343

- Published: 2011-01-28T16:00:00

Balabit syslog-ng 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2 OSE and PE, when running on FreeBSD or HP-UX, does not properly perform cast operations, which causes syslog-ng to use a default value of -1 to create log files with insecure permissions (07777), which allows local users to read and write to these log files.

### CVSS Score: **6.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
