- Published: 2012-01-04T03:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:34:00

IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager (TFIM) and Tivoli Federated Identity Manager Business Gateway (TFIMBG) 6.1.1, 6.2.0, and 6.2.1 do not properly handle signature validations based on SAML 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended authentication or authorization requirements via a non-conforming SAML signature.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
