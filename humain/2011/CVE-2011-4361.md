# CVE-2011-4361

- Published: 2012-01-08T11:55:00

MediaWiki before 1.17.1 does not check for read permission before handling action=ajax requests, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by (1) leveraging the SpecialUpload::ajaxGetExistsWarning function, or by (2) leveraging an extension, as demonstrated by the CategoryTree, ExtTab, and InlineEditor extensions.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
