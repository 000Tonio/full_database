- Published: 2013-03-01T12:37:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:32:00

fs/ext4/extents.c in the Linux kernel before 3.0 does not mark a modified extent as dirty in certain cases of extent splitting, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) via vectors involving ext4 umount and mount operations.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
