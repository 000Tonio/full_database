The (1) cudaHostAlloc and (2) cuMemHostAlloc functions in the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit 3.2 developer drivers for Linux 260.19.26, and possibly other versions, do not initialize pinned memory, which allows local users to read potentially sensitive memory, such as file fragments during read or write operations.
