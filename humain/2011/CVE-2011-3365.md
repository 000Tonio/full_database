The KDE SSL Wrapper (KSSL) API in KDE SC 4.6.0 through 4.7.1, and possibly earlier versions, does not use a certain font when rendering certificate fields in a security dialog, which allows remote attackers to spoof the common name (CN) of a certificate via rich text.

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
