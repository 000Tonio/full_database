** DISPUTED ** Adobe ColdFusion 9.0.1 CHF1 and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via an id=- query to a .cfm file, which reveals the installation path in an error message.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue because the Site-wide Error Handler and Debug Output Settings sections of the ColdFusion Lockdown guide explain the requirement for settings that prevent this information disclosure.

### CVSS Score: **5**
