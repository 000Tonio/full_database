Siemens Automation License Manager (ALM) 4.0 through 5.1+SP1+Upd1 does not properly copy fields obtained from clients, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (exception and daemon crash) via long fields, as demonstrated by fields to the (1) open_session->workstation->NAME or (2) grant->VERSION function.

### CVSS Score: **5**
