mm/huge_memory.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.38-rc5 does not prevent creation of a transparent huge page (THP) during the existence of a temporary stack for an exec system call, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted application.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
