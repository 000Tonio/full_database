Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the PMA_unInlineEditRow function in js/sql.js in phpMyAdmin 3.4.x before 3.4.5 allow remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a (1) database name, (2) table name, or (3) column name that is not properly handled after an inline-editing operation.
