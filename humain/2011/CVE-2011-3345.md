ulp/sdp/sdp_proc.c in the ib_sdp module (aka ib_sdp.ko) in the ofa_kernel package in the InfiniBand driver implementation in OpenFabrics Enterprise Distribution (OFED) before 1.5.3 does not properly handle certain non-array variables, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack memory corruption and system crash) by reading the /proc/net/sdpstats file.
