- Published: 2011-12-08T11:55:00

- Modified: 2020-04-01T13:09:00

dhcpd in ISC DHCP 4.x before 4.2.3-P1 and 4.1-ESV before 4.1-ESV-R4 does not properly handle regular expressions in dhcpd.conf, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a crafted request packet.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
