The iPhoneHandle package 0.9.x before 0.9.7 and 1.0.x before 1.0.3 in Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) does not properly restrict use of the iPhoneHandle interface, which allows remote authenticated users to gain privileges, and consequently read or modify OTRS core objects, via unspecified vectors.

| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
