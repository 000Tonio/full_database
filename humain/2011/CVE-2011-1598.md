The bcm_release function in net/can/bcm.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39-rc6 does not properly validate a socket data structure, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted release operation.

| --- | --- | --- |
