# CVE-2011-4681

- Published: 2011-12-07T19:55:00

Opera before 11.60 does not properly consider the number of . (dot) characters that conventionally exist in domain names of different top-level domains, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy by leveraging access to a different domain name in the same top-level domain, as demonstrated by the .no or .uk domain.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
