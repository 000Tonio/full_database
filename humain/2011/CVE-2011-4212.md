The sandbox environment in the Google App Engine Python SDK before 1.5.4 does not properly prevent os.popen calls, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions and execute arbitrary commands via a dev_appserver.RestrictedPathFunction._original_os reference within the code parameter to _ah/admin/interactive/execute, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-1364.
