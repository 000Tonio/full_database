Heap-based buffer overflow in tcptrack before 1.4.2 might allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long command line argument. NOTE: this is only a vulnerability in limited scenarios in which tcptrack is "configured as a handler for other applications." This issue might not qualify for inclusion in CVE.
