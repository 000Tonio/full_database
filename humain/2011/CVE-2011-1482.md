Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in mainfile.php in Francisco Burzi PHP-Nuke 8.0 and earlier allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) add user accounts or (2) grant the administrative privilege to a user account, related to a Referer check that uses a substring comparison.
