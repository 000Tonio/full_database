The ocfs2_prepare_page_for_write function in fs/ocfs2/aops.c in the Oracle Cluster File System 2 (OCFS2) subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39-rc1 does not properly handle holes that cross page boundaries, which allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from uninitialized disk locations by reading a file.
