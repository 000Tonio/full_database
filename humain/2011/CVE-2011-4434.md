Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 and R2 SP1 and Windows 7 Gold and SP1 do not properly enforce AppLocker rules, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions via a (1) macro or (2) scripting feature in an application, as demonstrated by Microsoft Office applications and the SANDBOX_INERT and LOAD_IGNORE_CODE_AUTHZ_LEVEL flags.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
