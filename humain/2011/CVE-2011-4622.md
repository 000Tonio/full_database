# CVE-2011-4622

- Published: 2012-01-27T15:55:00

- Modified: 2017-12-29T02:29:00

The create_pit_timer function in arch/x86/kvm/i8254.c in KVM 83, and possibly other versions, does not properly handle when Programmable Interval Timer (PIT) interrupt requests (IRQs) when a virtual interrupt controller (irqchip) is not available, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) by starting a timer.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
