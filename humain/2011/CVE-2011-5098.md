chef-server-api/app/controllers/clients.rb in Chef Server in Chef before 0.9.20, and 0.10.x before 0.10.6, does not require administrative privileges for creating admin clients, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging read permission for the validation key and executing a knife client create command with the --admin option.
