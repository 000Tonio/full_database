The (1) AgentInterface and (2) CustomerInterface components in Open Ticket Request System (OTRS) before 3.0.6 place cleartext credentials into the session data in the database, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading the _UserLogin and _UserPW fields.
