IBM DB2 9.5 before FP7 and 9.7 before FP4 on Linux, UNIX, and Windows does not properly enforce privilege requirements for table access, which allows remote authenticated users to modify SYSSTAT.TABLES statistics columns via an UPDATE statement.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
