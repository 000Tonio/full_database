# CVE-2011-4086

- Published: 2012-07-03T16:40:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T01:21:00

The journal_unmap_buffer function in fs/jbd2/transaction.c in the Linux kernel before 3.3.1 does not properly handle the _Delay and _Unwritten buffer head states, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) by leveraging the presence of an ext4 filesystem that was mounted with a journal.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
