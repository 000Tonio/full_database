content/renderer/device_sensors/device_motion_event_pump.cc in Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76 does not properly restrict access to high-rate accelerometer data, which makes it easier for remote attackers to capture keystrokes via a crafted web site that listens for ondevicemotion events, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-1231.
