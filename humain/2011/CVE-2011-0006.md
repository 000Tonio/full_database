The ima_lsm_rule_init function in security/integrity/ima/ima_policy.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.37, when the Linux Security Modules (LSM) framework is disabled, allows local users to bypass Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA) rules in opportunistic circumstances by leveraging an administrator's addition of an IMA rule for LSM.
