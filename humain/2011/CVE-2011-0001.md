Double free vulnerability in the iscsi_rx_handler function (usr/iscsi/iscsid.c) in the tgt daemon (tgtd) in Linux SCSI target framework (tgt) before 1.0.14, aka scsi-target-utils, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via unknown vectors related to a buffer overflow during iscsi login. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
