# CVE-2011-2701

- Published: 2011-08-04T02:45:00

- Modified: 2018-10-09T19:32:00

The ocsp_check function in rlm_eap_tls.c in FreeRADIUS 2.1.11, when OCSP is enabled, does not properly parse replies from OCSP responders, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by using the EAP-TLS protocol with a revoked X.509 client certificate.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
