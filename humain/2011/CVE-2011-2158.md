# CVE-2011-2158

- Published: 2011-05-20T22:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:29:00

The SmarterTools SmarterStats 6.0 web server sends incorrect Content-Type headers for certain resources, which might allow remote attackers to have an unspecified impact by leveraging an interpretation conflict involving (1) Admin/frmSite.aspx, (2) Admin/frmSites.aspx, (3) Admin/frmViewReports.aspx, (4) App_Themes/AboutThisFolder.txt, (5) Client/frmViewReports.aspx, (6) Temp/AboutThisFolder.txt, (7) default.aspx, (8) login.aspx, or (9) certain .jpg URIs under Temp/.  NOTE: it is possible that only clients, not the SmarterStats product, could be affected by this issue.
