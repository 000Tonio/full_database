# CVE-2011-0987

- Published: 2011-02-14T22:00:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:33:00

The PMA_Bookmark_get function in libraries/bookmark.lib.php in phpMyAdmin 2.11.x before 2.11.11.3, and 3.3.x before 3.3.9.2, does not properly restrict bookmark queries, which makes it easier for remote authenticated users to trigger another user's execution of a SQL query by creating a bookmark.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
