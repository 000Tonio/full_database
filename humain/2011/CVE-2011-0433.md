Heap-based buffer overflow in the linetoken function in afmparse.c in t1lib, as used in teTeX 3.0.x, GNOME evince, and possibly other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a DVI file containing a crafted Adobe Font Metrics (AFM) file, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-2642.
