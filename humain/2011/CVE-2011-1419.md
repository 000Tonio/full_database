Apache Tomcat 7.x before 7.0.11, when web.xml has no security constraints, does not follow ServletSecurity annotations, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via HTTP requests to a web application.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-1088.
