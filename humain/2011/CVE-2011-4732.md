# CVE-2011-4732

- Published: 2011-12-16T11:55:00

- Modified: 2019-04-22T17:48:00

The Server Administration Panel in Parallels Plesk Panel 10.2.0_build1011110331.18 omits the Content-Type header's charset parameter for certain resources, which might allow remote attackers to have an unspecified impact by leveraging an interpretation conflict involving account/power-mode-logout and certain other files.  NOTE: it is possible that only clients, not the Plesk product, could be affected by this issue.
