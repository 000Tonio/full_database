The Curl_input_negotiate function in http_negotiate.c in libcurl 7.10.6 through 7.21.6, as used in curl and other products, always performs credential delegation during GSSAPI authentication, which allows remote servers to impersonate clients via GSSAPI requests.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
