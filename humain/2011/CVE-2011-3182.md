PHP before 5.3.7 does not properly check the return values of the malloc, calloc, and realloc library functions, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) or trigger a buffer overflow by leveraging the ability to provide an arbitrary value for a function argument, related to (1) ext/curl/interface.c, (2) ext/date/lib/parse_date.c, (3) ext/date/lib/parse_iso_intervals.c, (4) ext/date/lib/parse_tz.c, (5) ext/date/lib/timelib.c, (6) ext/pdo_odbc/pdo_odbc.c, (7) ext/reflection/php_reflection.c, (8) ext/soap/php_sdl.c, (9) ext/xmlrpc/libxmlrpc/base64.c, (10) TSRM/tsrm_win32.c, and (11) the strtotime function. Per: http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html 
'CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference'
