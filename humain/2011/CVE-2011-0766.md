The random number generator in the Crypto application before 2.0.2.2, and SSH before 2.0.5, as used in the Erlang/OTP ssh library before R14B03, uses predictable seeds based on the current time, which makes it easier for remote attackers to guess DSA host and SSH session keys.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
