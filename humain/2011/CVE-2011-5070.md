Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Support Incident Tracker (aka SiT!) 3.65 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the file name to incident_attachments.php; (2) unspecified vectors in link_add.php, possibly involving origref, linkref, linktype parameters, which are not properly handled in the clean_int function in lib/base.inc.php, or the redirect parameter, which is not properly handled in the html_redirect function in lib/html.inc.php; and (3) unspecified vectors in translate.php.
