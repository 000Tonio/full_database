Google V8 computes hash values for form parameters without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many crafted parameters, as demonstrated by attacks against Node.js.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
