The server components in Objectivity/DB 10.0 do not require authentication for administrative commands, which allows remote attackers to modify data, obtain sensitive information, or cause a denial of service by sending requests over TCP to (1) the Lock Server or (2) the Advanced Multithreaded Server, as demonstrated by commands that are ordinarily sent by the (a) ookillls and (b) oostopams applications.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
