Tor before 0.2.1.29 and 0.2.2.x before 0.2.2.21-alpha does not properly manage key data in memory, which might allow local users to obtain sensitive information by leveraging the ability to read memory that was previously used by a different process.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
