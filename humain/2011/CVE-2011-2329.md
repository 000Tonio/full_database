# CVE-2011-2329

- Published: 2011-06-02T20:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:29:00

The rampart_timestamp_token_validate function in util/rampart_timestamp_token.c in Apache Rampart/C 1.3.0 does not properly calculate the expiration of timestamp tokens, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging an expired token, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-0730.
