# CVE-2011-4868

- Published: 2012-01-15T03:55:00

- Modified: 2016-12-03T02:59:00

The logging functionality in dhcpd in ISC DHCP before 4.2.3-P2, when using Dynamic DNS (DDNS) and issuing IPv6 addresses, does not properly handle the DHCPv6 lease structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via crafted packets related to a lease-status update.

### CVSS Score: **6.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
