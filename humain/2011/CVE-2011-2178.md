# CVE-2011-2178

- Published: 2011-08-10T20:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:30:00

The virSecurityManagerGetPrivateData function in security/security_manager.c in libvirt 0.8.8 through 0.9.1 uses the wrong argument for a sizeof call, which causes incorrect processing of "security manager private data" that "reopens disk probing" and might allow guest OS users to read arbitrary files on the host OS. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of a CVE-2010-2238 regression.

### CVSS Score: **4.4**
