# CVE-2011-3982

- Published: 2011-10-05T02:56:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:30:00

The Fibre Channel driver for QLogic adapters in IBM AIX 6.1 and 7.1 does not properly handle DMA resource limitations, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system hang) via vectors that generate a large amount of DMA I/O, related to a deadlock in timer processing across CPUs.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
