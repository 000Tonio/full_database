# CVE-2011-1765

- Published: 2011-05-23T22:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:17:00

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in MediaWiki before 1.16.5, when Internet Explorer 6 or earlier is used, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via an uploaded file accessed with a dangerous extension such as .shtml at the end of the query string, in conjunction with a modified URI path that has a %2E sequence in place of the . (dot) character. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-1578 and CVE-2011-1587.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
