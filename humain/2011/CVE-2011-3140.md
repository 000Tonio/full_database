# CVE-2011-3140

- Published: 2011-08-15T21:55:00

- Modified: 2018-10-09T19:33:00

IBM Web Application Firewall, as used on the G400 IPS-G400-IB-1 and GX4004 IPS-GX4004-IB-2 appliances with update 31.030, does not properly handle query strings with multiple instances of the same parameter, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended intrusion prevention by dividing a dangerous parameter value into substrings, as demonstrated by a SQL statement that is split across multiple iid parameters and then sent to a .aspx file on an IIS web server.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
