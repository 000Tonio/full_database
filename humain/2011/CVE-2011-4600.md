The networkReloadIptablesRules function in network/bridge_driver.c in libvirt before 0.9.9 does not properly handle firewall rules on bridge networks when libvirtd is restarted, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a (1) DNS or (2) DHCP query.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
