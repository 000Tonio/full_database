# CVE-2011-3609

- Published: 2019-11-26T03:15:00

A CSRF issue was found in JBoss Application Server 7 before 7.1.0. JBoss did not properly restrict access to the management console information (for example via the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" HTTP access control flag). This can lead to unauthorized information leak if a user with admin privileges visits a specially-crafted web page provided by a remote attacker.
