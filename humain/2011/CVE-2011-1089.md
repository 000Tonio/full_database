# CVE-2011-1089

- Published: 2011-04-10T02:55:00

- Modified: 2016-12-07T18:15:00

The addmntent function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) 2.13 and earlier does not report an error status for failed attempts to write to the /etc/mtab file, which makes it easier for local users to trigger corruption of this file, as demonstrated by writes from a process with a small RLIMIT_FSIZE value, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-0296.
