- Published: 2011-11-08T11:55:00

- Modified: 2012-07-03T04:04:00

The ap_pregsub function in server/util.c in the Apache HTTP Server 2.0.x through 2.0.64 and 2.2.x through 2.2.21, when the mod_setenvif module is enabled, does not restrict the size of values of environment variables, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or NULL pointer dereference) via a .htaccess file with a crafted SetEnvIf directive, in conjunction with a crafted HTTP request header, related to (1) the "len +=" statement and (2) the apr_pcalloc function call, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-3607.
