# CVE-2011-2159

- Published: 2011-05-20T22:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:29:00

The SmarterTools SmarterStats 6.0 web server omits the Content-Type header for certain resources, which might allow remote attackers to have an unspecified impact by leveraging an interpretation conflict involving (1) Admin/Defaults/frmDefaultSiteSettings.aspx, (2) Admin/Defaults/frmServerDefaults.aspx, (3) Admin/frmReportSettings.aspx, (4) Admin/frmSite.aspx, (5) App_Themes/Default/ButtonBarIcons.xml, (6) App_Themes/Default/Skin.xml, (7) Client/frmImportSettings.aspx, (8) Client/frmSeoSettings.aspx, (9) Services/Web.config, (10) aspnet_client/system_web/4_0_30319/, (11) clientaccesspolicy.xml, (12) cloudscan.exe, (13) crossdomain.xml, or (14) sitemap.xml.  NOTE: it is possible that only clients, not the SmarterStats product, could be affected by this issue.
