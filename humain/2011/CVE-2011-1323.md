Yamaha RTX, RT, SRT, RTV, RTW, and RTA series routers with firmware 6.x through 10.x, and NEC IP38X series routers with firmware 6.x through 10.x, do not properly handle IP header options, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device reboot) via a crafted option that triggers access to an invalid memory location.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
