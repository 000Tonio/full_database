Core Server HMI Service (Coreservice.exe) in Scadatec Limited Procyon SCADA 1.06, and other versions before 1.14, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long password to the Telnet (TCP/23) port, which triggers an out-of-bounds read or write, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.
