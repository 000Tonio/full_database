# CVE-2011-4080

- Published: 2012-05-24T23:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:32:00

The sysrq_sysctl_handler function in kernel/sysctl.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39 does not require the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability to modify the dmesg_restrict value, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions and read the kernel ring buffer by leveraging root privileges, as demonstrated by a root user in a Linux Containers (aka LXC) environment.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
