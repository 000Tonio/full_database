Best Practical Solutions RT 4.x before 4.0.6 does not properly implement the DisallowExecuteCode option, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions and execute arbitrary code by leveraging access to a privileged account, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-4458 and CVE-2011-5092.
