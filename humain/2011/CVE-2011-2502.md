runtime/staprun/staprun_funcs.c in the systemtap runtime tool (staprun) in SystemTap before 1.6 does not properly validate modules when a module path is specified by a user for user-space probing, which allows local users in the stapusr group to gain privileges via a crafted module in the search path in the -u argument.
