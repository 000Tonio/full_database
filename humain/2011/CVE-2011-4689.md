Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 through 9 does not prevent capture of data about the times of Same Origin Policy violations during IFRAME loading attempts, which makes it easier for remote attackers to determine whether a document exists in the browser cache via crafted JavaScript code.

| --- | --- | --- |
