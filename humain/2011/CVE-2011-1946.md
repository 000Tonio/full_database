gnomesu-pam-backend in libgnomesu 1.0.0 prints an error message but proceeds with the non-error code path upon failure of the setgid or setuid function, which allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging access to two unprivileged user accounts, and running many processes under one of these accounts.
