# CVE-2011-1398

- Published: 2012-08-30T22:55:00

- Modified: 2013-10-11T03:34:00

The sapi_header_op function in main/SAPI.c in PHP before 5.3.11 and 5.4.x before 5.4.0RC2 does not check for %0D sequences (aka carriage return characters), which allows remote attackers to bypass an HTTP response-splitting protection mechanism via a crafted URL, related to improper interaction between the PHP header function and certain browsers, as demonstrated by Internet Explorer and Google Chrome.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
