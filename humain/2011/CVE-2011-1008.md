Scrips_Overlay.pm in Best Practical Solutions RT before 3.8.9 does not properly restrict access to a TicketObj in a Scrip after a CurrentUser change, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information via unspecified vectors, as demonstrated by custom-field value information, related to SQL logging.

| --- | --- | --- |
