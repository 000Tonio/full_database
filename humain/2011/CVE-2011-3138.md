The LTPA STS module support implementation in IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager (TFIM) 6.2.0 before 6.2.0.9 and Tivoli Federated Identity Manager Business Gateway (TFIMBG) 6.2.0 before 6.2.0.9 relies on a static instance of a Java Development Kit (JDK) class, which might allow attackers to bypass LTPA token signature verification by leveraging lack of thread safety.
