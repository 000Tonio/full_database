The AuthCache purge implementation in the Security component in IBM WebSphere Application Server (WAS) 6.1.0.x before 6.1.0.37 and 7.x before 7.0.0.15 does not purge a user from the PlatformCredential cache, which might allow remote authenticated users to gain privileges by leveraging a group membership specified in an old RACF Object (aka RACO).

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |
