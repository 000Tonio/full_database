The OpenType Compact Font Format (CFF) driver in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP1 and SP2, Windows Server 2008 Gold, SP2, and R2, and Windows 7 does not properly validate parameter values in OpenType fonts, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted font, aka "OpenType Font Encoded Character Vulnerability."
