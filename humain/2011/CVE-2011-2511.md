- Published: 2011-08-10T20:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:31:00

Integer overflow in libvirt before 0.9.3 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (libvirtd crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted VirDomainGetVcpus RPC call that triggers memory corruption.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
