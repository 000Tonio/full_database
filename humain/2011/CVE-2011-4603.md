# CVE-2011-4603

- Published: 2011-12-17T03:54:00

- Modified: 2017-09-19T01:34:00

The silc_channel_message function in ops.c in the SILC protocol plugin in libpurple in Pidgin before 2.10.1 does not perform the expected UTF-8 validation on message data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted message, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-3594.

### CVSS Score: **5**
