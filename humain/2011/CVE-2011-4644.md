# CVE-2011-4644

- Published: 2012-01-03T11:55:00

- Modified: 2012-01-26T05:00:00

Splunk 4.2.5 and earlier, when a Free license is selected, enables potentially undesirable functionality within an environment that intentionally does not support authentication, which allows remote attackers to (1) read arbitrary files via a management-console session that leverages the ability to create crafted data sources, or (2) execute management commands via an HTTP request.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
