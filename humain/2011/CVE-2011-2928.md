# CVE-2011-2928

- Published: 2011-08-29T17:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:32:00

The befs_follow_link function in fs/befs/linuxvfs.c in the Linux kernel before 3.1-rc3 does not validate the length attribute of long symlinks, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (incorrect pointer dereference and OOPS) by accessing a long symlink on a malformed Be filesystem.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
