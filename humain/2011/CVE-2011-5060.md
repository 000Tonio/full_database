# CVE-2011-5060

- Published: 2012-01-13T19:55:00

The par_mktmpdir function in the PAR module before 1.003 for Perl creates temporary files in a directory with a predictable name without verifying ownership and permissions of this directory, which allows local users to overwrite files when another user extracts a PAR packed program, a different vulnerability in a different package than CVE-2011-4114.
