- Published: 2011-12-23T03:59:00

- Modified: 2011-12-23T05:00:00

Tor before 0.2.2.34, when configured as a bridge, uses direct DirPort access instead of a Tor TLS connection for a directory fetch, which makes it easier for remote attackers to enumerate bridges by observing DirPort connections.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
