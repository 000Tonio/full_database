- Published: 2011-02-02T01:00:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:33:00

MyProxy 5.0 through 5.2, as used in Globus Toolkit 5.0.0 through 5.0.2, does not properly verify the (1) hostname or (2) identity in the X.509 certificate for the myproxy-server, which allows remote attackers to spoof the server and conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks via a crafted certificate when executing (a) myproxy-logon or (b) myproxy-get-delegation.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
