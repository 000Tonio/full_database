# CVE-2011-1747

- Published: 2011-05-09T19:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T01:19:00

The agp subsystem in the Linux kernel 2.6.38.5 and earlier does not properly restrict memory allocation by the (1) AGPIOC_RESERVE and (2) AGPIOC_ALLOCATE ioctls, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) by making many calls to these ioctls.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
