Mozilla Firefox before 9.0, Thunderbird before 9.0, and SeaMonkey before 2.6 on Mac OS X do not properly handle certain DOM frame deletions by plugins, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect pointer dereference and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted web site. Per: http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html

'CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference'
