# CVE-2011-4106

- Published: 2013-10-26T16:55:00

- Modified: 2013-10-28T15:15:00

TimThumb (timthumb.php) before 2.0 does not validate the entire source with the domain white list, which allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary code via a URL containing a white-listed domain in the src parameter, then accessing it via a direct request to the file in the cache directory, as exploited in the wild in August 2011.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
