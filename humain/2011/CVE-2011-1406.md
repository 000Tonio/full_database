# CVE-2011-1406

- Published: 2011-05-13T22:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:34:00

Mahara before 1.3.6 does not properly handle an https URL in the wwwroot configuration setting, which makes it easier for user-assisted remote attackers to obtain credentials by sniffing the network at a time when an http URL is used for a login.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
