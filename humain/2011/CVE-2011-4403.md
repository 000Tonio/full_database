Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in Zen Cart 1.3.9h allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) delete a product via a delete_product_confirm action to product.php or (2) disable a product via a setflag action to categories.php. Per the <a href="http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2012/Feb/171">advisory</a>:  "By submitting this form from any location an attacker can cause the
administrator to delete / disable products from his store."  Only integrity and availability are affected.
