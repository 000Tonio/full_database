- Modified: 2012-06-28T12:57:00

The make_clickable function in wp-includes/formatting.php in WordPress before 3.1.1 does not properly check URLs before passing them to the PCRE library, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a comment with a crafted URL that triggers many recursive calls.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
