The gif_read_lzw function in filter/image-gif.c in CUPS 1.4.8 and earlier does not properly handle the first code word in an LZW stream, which allows remote attackers to trigger a heap-based buffer overflow, and possibly execute arbitrary code, via a crafted stream, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-2896.
