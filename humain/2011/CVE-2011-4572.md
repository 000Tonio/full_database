Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in inc/tesmodrewite.php in CF Image Hosting Script 1.3.82, 1.4.1, and probably other versions before 1.4.2 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the q parameter.  NOTE: this was originally reported as a file disclosure vulnerability, but this is likely inaccurate.
