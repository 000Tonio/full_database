# CVE-2011-1824

- Published: 2011-05-10T18:55:00

- Modified: 2018-10-09T19:32:00

The VEGAOpBitmap::AddLine function in Opera before 10.61 does not properly initialize memory during processing of the SIZE attribute of a SELECT element, which allows remote attackers to trigger an invalid memory write operation, and consequently cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code, via a large integer attribute value.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
