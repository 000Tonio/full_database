# CVE-2011-0695

- Published: 2011-03-15T17:55:00

Race condition in the cm_work_handler function in the InfiniBand driver (drivers/infiniband/core/cma.c) in Linux kernel 2.6.x allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (panic) by sending an InfiniBand request while other request handlers are still running, which triggers an invalid pointer dereference.
