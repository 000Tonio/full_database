Parallels Plesk Small Business Panel 10.2.0 generates a password form field without disabling the autocomplete feature, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass authentication by leveraging an unattended workstation, as demonstrated by forms in smb/auth and certain other files.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
