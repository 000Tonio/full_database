- Published: 2012-11-23T20:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:20:00

The servlets invoked by httpha-invoker in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform before 5.1.2, SOA Platform before 5.2.0, BRMS Platform before 5.3.0, and Portal Platform before 4.3 CP07 perform access control only for the GET and POST methods, which allow remote attackers to bypass authentication by sending a request with a different method. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of a CVE-2010-0738 regression.
