The setup scripts in 389 Directory Server 1.2.x (aka Red Hat Directory Server 8.2.x), when multiple unprivileged instances are configured, use 0777 permissions for the /var/run/dirsrv directory, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (daemon outage or arbitrary process termination) by replacing PID files contained in this directory.
