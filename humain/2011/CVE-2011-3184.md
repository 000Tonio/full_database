# CVE-2011-3184

- Published: 2011-08-29T17:55:00

- Modified: 2017-09-19T01:33:00

The msn_httpconn_parse_data function in httpconn.c in the MSN protocol plugin in libpurple in Pidgin before 2.10.0 does not properly handle HTTP 100 responses, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect memory access and application crash) via vectors involving a crafted server message.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
