The OpenSSL extension of Ruby (Git trunk) versions after 2011-09-01 up to 2011-11-03 always generated an exponent value of '1' to be used for private RSA key generation. A remote attacker could use this flaw to bypass or corrupt integrity of services, depending on strong private RSA keys generation mechanism.
