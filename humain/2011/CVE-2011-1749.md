# CVE-2011-1749

- Published: 2014-02-26T15:55:00

The nfs_addmntent function in support/nfs/nfs_mntent.c in the mount.nsf tool in nfs-utils before 1.2.4 attempts to append to the /etc/mtab file without first checking whether resource limits would interfere, which allows local users to corrupt this file via a process with a small RLIMIT_FSIZE value, a related issue to CVE-2011-1089.
