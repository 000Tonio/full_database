- Published: 2011-06-30T15:55:00

- Modified: 2011-07-12T04:00:00

The GPU support functionality in Mac OS X does not properly restrict rendering time, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (desktop hang) via vectors involving WebGL and (1) shader programs or (2) complex 3D geometry, as demonstrated by using Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome to visit the lots-of-polys-example.html test page in the Khronos WebGL SDK.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
