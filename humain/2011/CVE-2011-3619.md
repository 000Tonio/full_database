The apparmor_setprocattr function in security/apparmor/lsm.c in the Linux kernel before 3.0 does not properly handle invalid parameters, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) or possibly have unspecified other impact by writing to a /proc/#####/attr/current file.
