Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in xt:Commerce 3.0.4 SP2.1 and possibly earlier allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of Admins for requests that (1) set a New user to Admin via the cID parameter to a statusconfirm action in admin/customers.php and (2) grant permissions to users via the cID parameter to a save action in admin/accounting.php.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
