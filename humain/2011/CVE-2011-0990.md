# CVE-2011-0990

- Published: 2011-04-13T21:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:33:00

Race condition in the FastCopy optimization in the Array.Copy method in metadata/icall.c in Mono, when Moonlight 2.x before 2.4.1 or 3.x before 3.99.3 is used, allows remote attackers to trigger a buffer overflow and modify internal data structures, and cause a denial of service (plugin crash) or corrupt the internal state of the security manager, via a crafted media file in which a thread makes a change after a type check but before a copy action.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
