The Client/Server Run-time Subsystem (CSRSS) in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3 and Server 2003 SP2 does not properly kill processes after a logout, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information or gain privileges via a crafted application that continues to execute throughout the logout of one user and the login session of the next user, aka "CSRSS Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability," a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-0023.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**
