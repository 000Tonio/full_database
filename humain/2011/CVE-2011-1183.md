Apache Tomcat 7.0.11, when web.xml has no login configuration, does not follow security constraints, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via HTTP requests to a meta-data complete web application. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2011-1088 and CVE-2011-1419.
