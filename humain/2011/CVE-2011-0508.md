Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in system/modules/comments/Comments.php in Contao CMS 2.9.2, and possibly other versions before 2.9.3, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the HTTP X_FORWARDED_FOR header, which is stored by system/libraries/Environment.php but not properly handled by a comments action to main.php.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
