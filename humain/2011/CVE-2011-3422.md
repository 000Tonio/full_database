# CVE-2011-3422

- Published: 2011-09-12T12:40:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:30:00

The Keychain implementation in Apple Mac OS X 10.6.8 and earlier does not properly handle an untrusted attribute of a Certification Authority certificate, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof arbitrary SSL servers via an Extended Validation certificate, as demonstrated by https access with Safari.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
