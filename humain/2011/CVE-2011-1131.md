# CVE-2011-1131

- Published: 2011-06-21T02:52:00

- Modified: 2011-06-28T04:00:00

The PlushSearch2 function in Search.php in Simple Machines Forum (SMF) before 1.1.13, and 2.x before 2.0 RC5, uses certain cached data in a situation where a temporary table has been created, even though this cached data is intended only for situations where a temporary table has not been created, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a search.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
