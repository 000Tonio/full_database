# CVE-2011-1739

- Published: 2011-05-03T20:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:34:00

The makemask function in mountd.c in mountd in FreeBSD 7.4 through 8.2 does not properly handle a -network field specifying a CIDR block with a prefix length that is not an integer multiple of 8, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances via an NFS mount request.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
