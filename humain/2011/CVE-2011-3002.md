# CVE-2011-3002

- Published: 2011-09-29T00:55:00

- Modified: 2018-11-29T16:02:00

Almost Native Graphics Layer Engine (ANGLE), as used in Mozilla Firefox before 7.0 and SeaMonkey before 2.4, does not validate the return value of a GrowAtomTable function call, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors that trigger a memory-allocation error and a resulting buffer overflow.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
