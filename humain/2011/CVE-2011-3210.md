# CVE-2011-3210

- Published: 2011-09-22T10:55:00

- Modified: 2014-03-26T04:22:00

The ephemeral ECDH ciphersuite functionality in OpenSSL 0.9.8 through 0.9.8r and 1.0.x before 1.0.0e does not ensure thread safety during processing of handshake messages from clients, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via out-of-order messages that violate the TLS protocol.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
