# CVE-2011-1829

- Published: 2011-07-27T02:55:00

- Modified: 2021-03-25T19:27:00

APT before 0.8.15.2 does not properly validate inline GPG signatures, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to install modified packages via vectors involving lack of an initial clearsigned message.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
