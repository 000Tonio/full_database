# CVE-2011-1012

- Published: 2011-03-01T23:00:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T01:18:00

The ldm_parse_vmdb function in fs/partitions/ldm.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.38-rc6-git6 does not validate the VBLK size value in the VMDB structure in an LDM partition table, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and OOPS) via a crafted partition table.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
