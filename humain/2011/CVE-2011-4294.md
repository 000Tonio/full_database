# CVE-2011-4294

- Published: 2012-07-16T10:28:00

- Modified: 2020-12-01T14:43:00

The error-message functionality in Moodle 1.9.x before 1.9.13, 2.0.x before 2.0.4, and 2.1.x before 2.1.1 does not ensure that a continuation link refers to an http or https URL for the local Moodle instance, which might allow attackers to trick users into visiting arbitrary web sites via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
