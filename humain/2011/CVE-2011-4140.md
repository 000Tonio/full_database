# CVE-2011-4140

- Published: 2011-10-19T10:55:00

- Modified: 2018-01-18T02:29:00

The CSRF protection mechanism in Django through 1.2.7 and 1.3.x through 1.3.1 does not properly handle web-server configurations supporting arbitrary HTTP Host headers, which allows remote attackers to trigger unauthenticated forged requests via vectors involving a DNS CNAME record and a web page containing JavaScript code.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
