# CVE-2011-1751

- Published: 2012-06-21T15:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:30:00

The pciej_write function in hw/acpi_piix4.c in the PIIX4 Power Management emulation in qemu-kvm does not check if a device is hotpluggable before unplugging the PCI-ISA bridge, which allows privileged guest users to cause a denial of service (guest crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by sending a crafted value to the 0xae08 (PCI_EJ_BASE) I/O port, which leads to a use-after-free related to "active qemu timers."
