# CVE-2011-2512

- Published: 2012-06-21T15:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T01:19:00

The virtio_queue_notify in qemu-kvm 0.14.0 and earlier does not properly validate the virtqueue number, which allows guest users to cause a denial of service (guest crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a negative number in the Queue Notify field of the Virtio Header, which bypasses a signed comparison.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |
