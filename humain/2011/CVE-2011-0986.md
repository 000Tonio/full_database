phpMyAdmin 2.11.x before 2.11.11.2, and 3.3.x before 3.3.9.1, does not properly handle the absence of the (1) README, (2) ChangeLog, and (3) LICENSE files, which allows remote attackers to obtain the installation path via a direct request for a nonexistent file.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
