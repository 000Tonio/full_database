# CVE-2011-1584

- Published: 2011-06-08T10:36:00

- Modified: 2012-04-27T04:00:00

The updateFile function in inc/core/class.dc.media.php in the Media Manager in Dotclear before 2.2.3 does not properly restrict pathnames, which allows remote authenticated users to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code via the media_path or media_file parameter.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
