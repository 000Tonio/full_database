Apache Tomcat 7.0.0 through 7.0.6 and 6.0.0 through 6.0.30 does not enforce the maxHttpHeaderSize limit for requests involving the NIO HTTP connector, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (OutOfMemoryError) via a crafted request.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
