# CVE-2011-4114

- Published: 2012-01-13T18:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:20:00

The par_mktmpdir function in the PAR::Packer module before 1.012 for Perl creates temporary files in a directory with a predictable name without verifying ownership and permissions of this directory, which allows local users to overwrite files when another user extracts a PAR packed program. NOTE: a similar vulnerability was reported for PAR, but this has been assigned a different CVE identifier.
