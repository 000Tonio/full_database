# CVE-2011-1093

- Published: 2011-07-18T22:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T01:18:00

The dccp_rcv_state_process function in net/dccp/input.c in the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.38 does not properly handle packets for a CLOSED endpoint, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) by sending a DCCP-Close packet followed by a DCCP-Reset packet.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
