Tor before 0.2.1.29 and 0.2.2.x before 0.2.2.21-alpha does not properly check the amount of compression in zlib-compressed data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a large compression factor.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
