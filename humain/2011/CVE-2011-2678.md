The Cisco VPN Client 5.0.7.0240 and 5.0.7.0290 on 64-bit Windows platforms uses weak permissions (NT AUTHORITY\INTERACTIVE:F) for cvpnd.exe, which allows local users to gain privileges by replacing this executable file with an arbitrary program, aka Bug ID CSCtn50645. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of a CVE-2007-4415 regression.
