The cat6000-dot1x component in Cisco IOS 12.2 before 12.2(33)SXI7 does not properly handle an external loop between a pair of dot1x enabled ports, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic storm) via unspecified vectors that trigger many unicast EAPoL Protocol Data Units (PDUs), aka Bug ID CSCtq36336.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
