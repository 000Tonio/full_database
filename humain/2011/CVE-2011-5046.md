# CVE-2011-5046

- Published: 2011-12-30T19:55:00

- Modified: 2018-10-12T22:01:00

The Graphics Device Interface (GDI) in win32k.sys in the kernel-mode drivers in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2, R2, and R2 SP1, and Windows 7 Gold and SP1 does not properly validate user-mode input, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption) via crafted data, as demonstrated by a large height attribute of an IFRAME element rendered by Safari, aka "GDI Access Violation Vulnerability."
