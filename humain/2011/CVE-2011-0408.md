pngrtran.c in libpng 1.5.x before 1.5.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted palette-based PNG image that triggers a buffer overflow, related to the png_do_expand_palette function, the png_do_rgb_to_gray function, and an integer underflow.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
