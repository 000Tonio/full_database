Django 1.1.x before 1.1.4 and 1.2.x before 1.2.5 does not properly validate HTTP requests that contain an X-Requested-With header, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks via forged AJAX requests that leverage a "combination of browser plugins and redirects," a related issue to CVE-2011-0447.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
