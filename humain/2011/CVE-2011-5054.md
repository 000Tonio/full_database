# CVE-2011-5054

- Published: 2012-01-06T21:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:30:00

kcheckpass passes a user-supplied argument to the pam_start function, often within a setuid environment, which allows local users to invoke any configured PAM stack, and possibly trigger unintended side effects, via an arbitrary valid PAM service name, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-4122.  NOTE: the vendor indicates that the possibility of resultant privilege escalation may be "a bit far-fetched."
