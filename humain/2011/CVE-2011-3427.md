- Published: 2011-10-14T10:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:30:00

The Data Security component in Apple iOS before 5 and Apple TV before 4.4 does not properly restrict use of the MD5 hash algorithm within X.509 certificates, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers or obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
