# CVE-2011-1746

- Published: 2011-05-09T19:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T01:19:00

Multiple integer overflows in the (1) agp_allocate_memory and (2) agp_create_user_memory functions in drivers/char/agp/generic.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.38.5 allow local users to trigger buffer overflows, and consequently cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact, via vectors related to calls that specify a large number of memory pages.

### CVSS Score: **6.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
