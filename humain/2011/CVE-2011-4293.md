The theme implementation in Moodle 2.0.x before 2.0.4 and 2.1.x before 2.1.1 triggers duplicate caching of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript content, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and write to an operating-system temporary directory via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
