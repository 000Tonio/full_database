- Published: 2011-06-16T20:55:00

The MHTML protocol handler in Microsoft Windows XP SP2 and SP3, Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP1 and SP2, Windows Server 2008 Gold, SP2, R2, and R2 SP1, and Windows 7 Gold and SP1 does not properly handle a MIME format in a request for embedded content in an HTML document, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a crafted EMBED element in a web page that is visited in Internet Explorer, aka "MHTML Mime-Formatted Request Vulnerability."
