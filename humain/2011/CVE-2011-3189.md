# CVE-2011-3189

- Published: 2011-08-25T14:22:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:30:00

The crypt function in PHP 5.3.7, when the MD5 hash type is used, returns the value of the salt argument instead of the hashed string, which might allow remote attackers to bypass authentication via an arbitrary password, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-2483.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
