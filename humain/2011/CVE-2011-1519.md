# CVE-2011-1519

- Published: 2011-03-25T19:55:00

- Modified: 2018-10-09T19:31:00

The remote console in the Server Controller in IBM Lotus Domino 7.x and 8.x verifies credentials against a file located at a UNC share pathname specified by the client, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication, and consequently execute arbitrary code, by placing this pathname in the COOKIEFILE field.  NOTE: this might overlap CVE-2011-0920.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
