Puppet 2.6.0 through 2.6.3 does not properly restrict access to node resources, which allows remote authenticated Puppet nodes to read or modify the resources of other nodes via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
