The setup_cifs_sb function in fs/cifs/connect.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39 does not properly handle DFS referrals, which allows remote CIFS servers to cause a denial of service (system crash) by placing a referral at the root of a share.

### CVSS Score: **6.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
