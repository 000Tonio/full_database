# CVE-2011-4590

- Published: 2012-07-20T10:40:00

- Modified: 2020-12-01T14:41:00

The web services implementation in Moodle 2.0.x before 2.0.6 and 2.1.x before 2.1.3 does not properly consider the maintenance-mode state and account attributes during login attempts, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by connecting to a webservice server.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
