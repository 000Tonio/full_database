- Published: 2012-02-12T22:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:30:00

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in symphony/content/content.publish.php in Symphony CMS 2.2.3 and possibly other versions before 2.2.4 allow remote authenticated users with Author permissions to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the filter parameter to (1) symphony/publish/comments or (2) symphony/publish/images.  NOTE: this issue can be leveraged to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via error messages.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
