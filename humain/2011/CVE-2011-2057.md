# CVE-2011-2057

- Published: 2011-10-22T02:59:00

- Modified: 2020-08-05T15:18:00

The cat6000-dot1x component in Cisco IOS 12.2 before 12.2(33)SXI7 does not properly handle (1) a loop between a dot1x enabled port and an open-authentication dot1x enabled port and (2) a loop between a dot1x enabled port and a non-dot1x port, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic storm) via unspecified vectors that trigger many Spanning Tree Protocol (STP) Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) frames, aka Bug ID CSCtq36327.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
