# CVE-2011-4030

- Published: 2011-10-10T10:55:00

- Modified: 2011-10-30T03:39:00

The CMFEditions component 2.x in Plone 4.0.x through 4.0.9, 4.1, and 4.2 through 4.2a2 does not prevent the KwAsAttributes classes from being publishable, which allows remote attackers to access sub-objects via unspecified vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-3587.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**
