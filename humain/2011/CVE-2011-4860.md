The ComputePassword function in the Schneider Electric Quantum Ethernet Module on the NOE 771 device (aka the Quantum 140NOE771* module) generates the password for the fwupgrade account by performing a calculation on the MAC address, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access via a (1) ARP request message or (2) Neighbor Solicitation message.
