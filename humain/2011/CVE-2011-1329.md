WalRack 1.x before 1.1.9 and 2.x before 2.0.7 does not properly restrict file uploads, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via vectors involving a double extension, as demonstrated by a .php.zzz file.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
