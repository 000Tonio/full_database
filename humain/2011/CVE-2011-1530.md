- Published: 2011-12-08T20:55:00

The process_tgs_req function in do_tgs_req.c in the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.9 through 1.9.2 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via a crafted TGS request that triggers an error other than the KRB5_KDB_NOENTRY error.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
