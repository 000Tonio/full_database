Buffer overflow in the ulSetError function in util/ulError.cxx in PLIB 1.8.5, as used in TORCS 1.3.1 and other products, allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving a long error message, as demonstrated by a crafted acc file for TORCS. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
