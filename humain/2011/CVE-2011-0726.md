# CVE-2011-0726

- Published: 2011-07-18T22:55:00

- Modified: 2015-10-06T02:49:00

The do_task_stat function in fs/proc/array.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39-rc1 does not perform an expected uid check, which makes it easier for local users to defeat the ASLR protection mechanism by reading the start_code and end_code fields in the /proc/#####/stat file for a process executing a PIE binary.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
