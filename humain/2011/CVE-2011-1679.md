# CVE-2011-1679

- Published: 2011-04-10T02:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:34:00

ncpfs 2.2.6 and earlier attempts to use (1) ncpmount to append to the /etc/mtab file and (2) ncpumount to append to the /etc/mtab.tmp file without first checking whether resource limits would interfere, which allows local users to trigger corruption of the /etc/mtab file via a process with a small RLIMIT_FSIZE value, a related issue to CVE-2011-1089.
