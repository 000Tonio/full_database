- Published: 2014-02-10T18:15:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:32:00

The libobby server in inc/server.hpp in libnet6 (aka net6) before 1.3.14 does not perform authentication before checking the user name, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information such as server-usage patterns by a particular user and color preferences.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
