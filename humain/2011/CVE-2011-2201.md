# CVE-2011-2201

- Published: 2011-09-14T16:05:00

- Modified: 2011-09-14T16:05:00

The Data::FormValidator module 4.66 and earlier for Perl, when untaint_all_constraints is enabled, does not properly preserve the taint attribute of data, which might allow remote attackers to bypass the taint protection mechanism via form input.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
