WebKit, as used in Apple Safari 5.1.1 and earlier and Google Chrome 15 and earlier, does not prevent capture of data about the time required for image loading, which makes it easier for remote attackers to determine whether an image exists in the browser cache via crafted JavaScript code, as demonstrated by visipisi.
