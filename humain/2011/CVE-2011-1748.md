The raw_release function in net/can/raw.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39-rc6 does not properly validate a socket data structure, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted release operation.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |
