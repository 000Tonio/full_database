# CVE-2011-3599

- Published: 2011-10-10T10:55:00

- Modified: 2011-10-21T02:56:00

The Crypt::DSA (aka Crypt-DSA) module 1.17 and earlier for Perl, when /dev/random is absent, uses the Data::Random module, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof a signature, or determine the signing key of a signed message, via a brute-force attack.
