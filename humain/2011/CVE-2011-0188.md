# CVE-2011-0188

- Published: 2011-03-23T02:00:00

- Modified: 2011-08-24T03:15:00

The VpMemAlloc function in bigdecimal.c in the BigDecimal class in Ruby 1.9.2-p136 and earlier, as used on Apple Mac OS X before 10.6.7 and other platforms, does not properly allocate memory, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash) via vectors involving creation of a large BigDecimal value within a 64-bit process, related to an "integer truncation issue." Per: http://lists.apple.com/archives/security-announce/2011/Mar/msg00006.html

 'This issue only affects 64-bit Ruby processes'.
