- Published: 2012-06-13T10:24:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T01:19:00

The ip_expire function in net/ipv4/ip_fragment.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.39 does not properly construct ICMP_TIME_EXCEEDED packets after a timeout, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid pointer dereference) via crafted fragmented packets.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
