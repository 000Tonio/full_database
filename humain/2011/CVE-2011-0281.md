The unparse implementation in the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.6.x through 1.9, when an LDAP backend is used, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (file descriptor exhaustion and daemon hang) via a principal name that triggers use of a backslash escape sequence, as demonstrated by a \n sequence.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
