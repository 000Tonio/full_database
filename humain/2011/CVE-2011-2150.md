The SmarterTools SmarterStats 6.0 web server does not properly validate string data that is intended for storage in an XML document, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (parsing error and daemon pause) via vectors involving (1) certain cookies in a SiteInfoLookup action to Admin/frmSites.aspx, or certain (2) cookies or (3) parameters to (a) Client/frmViewOverviewReport.aspx, (b) Client/frmViewReports.aspx, or (c) Services/SiteAdmin.asmx, as demonstrated by a ]]>> string, related to an "XML injection" issue.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
