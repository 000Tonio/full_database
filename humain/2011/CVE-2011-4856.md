# CVE-2011-4856

- Published: 2011-12-16T11:55:00

The Control Panel in Parallels Plesk Panel 10.4.4_build20111103.18 sends incorrect Content-Type headers for certain resources, which might allow remote attackers to have an unspecified impact by leveraging an interpretation conflict involving admin/health/parameters and certain other files.  NOTE: it is possible that only clients, not the Plesk product, could be affected by this issue.
