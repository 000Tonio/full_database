** DISPUTED ** Adobe ColdFusion 9.0.1 CHF1 and earlier, when a web application is configured to use a DBMS, allows remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information about the database structure via an id=- query to a .cfm file.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue because the Site-wide Error Handler and Debug Output Settings sections of the ColdFusion Lockdown guide explain the requirement for settings that prevent this information disclosure.
