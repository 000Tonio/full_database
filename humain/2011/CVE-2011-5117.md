Sophos SafeGuard Enterprise Device Encryption 5.x through 5.50.8.13, Sophos SafeGuard Easy Device Encryption Client 5.50.x, and Sophos Disk Encryption 5.50.x have a delay before removal of (1) out-of-date credentials and (2) invalid credentials, which allows physically proximate attackers to defeat the full-disk encryption feature by leveraging knowledge of these credentials.
