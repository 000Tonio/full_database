The authoritative server in MaraDNS through 2.0.04 computes hash values for DNS data without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which might allow local users to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted records in zone files, a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-0024.
