# CVE-2011-4768

- Published: 2011-12-16T11:55:00

The Site Editor (aka SiteBuilder) feature in Parallels Plesk Small Business Panel 10.2.0 omits the Content-Type header's charset parameter for certain resources, which might allow remote attackers to have an unspecified impact by leveraging an interpretation conflict involving Wizard/Edit/Modules/Image and certain other files.  NOTE: it is possible that only clients, not the Plesk product, could be affected by this issue.
