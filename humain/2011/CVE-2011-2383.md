# CVE-2011-2383

- Published: 2011-06-03T17:55:00

- Modified: 2021-07-23T15:12:00

Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 and earlier does not properly restrict cross-zone drag-and-drop actions, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to read cookie files via vectors involving an IFRAME element with a SRC attribute containing an http: URL that redirects to a file: URL, as demonstrated by a Facebook game, related to a "cookiejacking" issue, aka "Drag and Drop Information Disclosure Vulnerability." NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix in the Internet Explorer 9 release.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
