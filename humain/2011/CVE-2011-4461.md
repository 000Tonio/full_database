- Modified: 2019-03-08T11:29:00

Jetty 8.1.0.RC2 and earlier computes hash values for form parameters without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many crafted parameters.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| --- | --- | --- |
