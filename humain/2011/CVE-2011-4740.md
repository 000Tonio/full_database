The Control Panel in Parallels Plesk Panel 10.2.0 build 20110407.20 generates web pages containing external links in response to GET requests with query strings for smb/app/search-data/catalogId/marketplace and certain other files, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading (1) web-server access logs or (2) web-server Referer logs, related to a "cross-domain Referer leakage" issue.
