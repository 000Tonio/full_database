# CVE-2011-0418

- Published: 2011-05-24T23:55:00

- Modified: 2011-09-22T03:28:00

The glob implementation in Pure-FTPd before 1.0.32, and in libc in NetBSD 5.1, does not properly expand expressions containing curly brackets, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted FTP STAT command.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
