# CVE-2011-2705

- Published: 2011-08-05T21:55:00

- Modified: 2012-01-19T03:58:00

The SecureRandom.random_bytes function in lib/securerandom.rb in Ruby before 1.8.7-p352 and 1.9.x before 1.9.2-p290 relies on PID values for initialization, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to predict the result string by leveraging knowledge of random strings obtained in an earlier process with the same PID.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
