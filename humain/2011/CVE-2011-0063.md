# CVE-2011-0063

- Published: 2011-03-15T17:55:00

- Modified: 2018-10-10T20:09:00

The _list_file_get function in lib/Majordomo.pm in Majordomo 2 20110203 and earlier allows remote attackers to conduct directory traversal attacks and read arbitrary files via a ./.../ sequence in the "extra" parameter to the help command, which causes the regular expression to produce .. (dot dot) sequences.  NOTE: this vulnerability is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2011-0049.

### CVSS Score: **5**
