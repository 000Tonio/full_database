# CVE-2011-3187

- Published: 2011-08-29T18:55:00

- Modified: 2019-08-08T15:41:00

The to_s method in actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/remote_ip.rb in Ruby on Rails 3.0.5 does not validate the X-Forwarded-For header in requests from IP addresses on a Class C network, which might allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary text into log files or bypass intended address parsing via a crafted header.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
