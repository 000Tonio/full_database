# CVE-2011-1044

- Published: 2011-02-18T20:00:00

- Modified: 2020-08-12T19:39:00

The ib_uverbs_poll_cq function in drivers/infiniband/core/uverbs_cmd.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.37 does not initialize a certain response buffer, which allows local users to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory via vectors that cause this buffer to be only partially filled, a different vulnerability than CVE-2010-4649.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
