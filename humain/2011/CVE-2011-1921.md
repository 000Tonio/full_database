# CVE-2011-1921

- Published: 2011-06-06T19:55:00

- Modified: 2017-09-19T01:32:00

The mod_dav_svn module for the Apache HTTP Server, as distributed in Apache Subversion 1.5.x and 1.6.x before 1.6.17, when the SVNPathAuthz short_circuit option is disabled, does not properly enforce permissions for files that had been publicly readable in the past, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a replay REPORT operation.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
