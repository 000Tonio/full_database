# CVE-2011-2507

- Published: 2011-07-14T23:55:00

- Modified: 2018-10-09T19:32:00

libraries/server_synchronize.lib.php in the Synchronize implementation in phpMyAdmin 3.x before 3.3.10.2 and 3.4.x before 3.4.3.1 does not properly quote regular expressions, which allows remote authenticated users to inject a PCRE e (aka PREG_REPLACE_EVAL) modifier, and consequently execute arbitrary PHP code, by leveraging the ability to modify the SESSION superglobal array.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
