# CVE-2011-0025

- Published: 2011-02-04T20:00:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:15:00

IcedTea 1.7 before 1.7.8, 1.8 before 1.8.5, and 1.9 before 1.9.5 does not properly verify signatures for JAR files that (1) are "partially signed" or (2) signed by multiple entities, which allows remote attackers to trick users into executing code that appears to come from a trusted source.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
