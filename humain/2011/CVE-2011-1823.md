# CVE-2011-1823

- Published: 2011-06-09T10:36:00

- Modified: 2017-08-17T01:34:00

The vold volume manager daemon on Android 3.0 and 2.x before 2.3.4 trusts messages that are received from a PF_NETLINK socket, which allows local users to execute arbitrary code and gain root privileges via a negative index that bypasses a maximum-only signed integer check in the DirectVolume::handlePartitionAdded method, which triggers memory corruption, as demonstrated by Gingerbreak.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
