# CVE-2011-4279

- Published: 2012-07-16T10:28:00

- Modified: 2020-12-01T14:41:00

Moodle 2.0.x before 2.0.2 does not use the forceloginforprofiles setting for course-profiles access control, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information via vectors involving use of a search engine, as demonstrated by the search functionality of Google, Yahoo!, Wrensoft Zoom, MSN, Yandex, and AltaVista.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
