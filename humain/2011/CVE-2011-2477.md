Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in config.c in config.cgi in Icinga before 1.4.1, when escape_html_tags is disabled, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a JavaScript expression, as demonstrated by the onload attribute of a BODY element located after a check-host-alive! sequence, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-2179.
