Multiple buffer overflows in Terascale Open-Source Resource and Queue Manager (aka TORQUE Resource Manager) 2.x before 2.4.14, 2.5.x before 2.5.6, and 3.x before 3.0.2 allow (1) remote authenticated users to gain privileges via a long Job_Name field in a qsub command to the server, and might allow (2) local users to gain privileges via vectors involving a long host variable in pbs_iff.

### CVSS Score: **8.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
