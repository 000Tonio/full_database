The kdb_ldap plugin in the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.9 through 1.9.1, when the LDAP back end is used, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via a kinit operation with incorrect string case for the realm, related to the is_principal_in_realm, krb5_set_error_message, krb5_ldap_get_principal, and process_as_req functions.
