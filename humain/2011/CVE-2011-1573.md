# CVE-2011-1573

- Published: 2012-02-02T04:09:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T01:19:00

net/sctp/sm_make_chunk.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.34, when addip_enable and auth_enable are used, does not consider the amount of zero padding during calculation of chunk lengths for (1) INIT and (2) INIT ACK chunks, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (OOPS) via crafted packet data.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
