Stack-based buffer overflow in magentservice.exe in the server in HP LoadRunner 11.00 before patch 4 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted size value in a packet.  NOTE: it was originally reported that the affected product is HP Diagnostics Server, but HP states that "the vulnerable product is actually HP LoadRunner."
