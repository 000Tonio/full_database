# CVE-2011-2689

- Published: 2011-07-28T22:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:31:00

The gfs2_fallocate function in fs/gfs2/file.c in the Linux kernel before 3.0-rc1 does not ensure that the size of a chunk allocation is a multiple of the block size, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (BUG and system crash) by arranging for all resource groups to have too little free space.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
