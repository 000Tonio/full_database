# CVE-2011-0008

- Published: 2011-01-20T19:00:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T03:22:00

A certain Fedora patch for parse.c in sudo before 1.7.4p5-1.fc14 on Fedora 14 does not properly interpret a system group (aka %group) in the sudoers file during authorization decisions for a user who belongs to that group, which allows local users to leverage an applicable sudoers file and gain root privileges via a sudo command. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of a CVE-2009-0034 regression.
