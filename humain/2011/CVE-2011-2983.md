Mozilla Firefox before 3.6.20, Thunderbird 2.x and 3.x before 3.1.12, SeaMonkey 1.x and 2.x, and possibly other products does not properly handle the RegExp.input property, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and read data from a different domain via a crafted web site, possibly related to a use-after-free.
