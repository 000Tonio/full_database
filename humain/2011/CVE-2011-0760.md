Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the configuration screen in wp-relatedposts.php in the WP Related Posts plugin 1.0 for WordPress allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that insert cross-site scripting (XSS) sequences via the (1) wp_relatedposts_title, (2) wp_relatedposts_num, or (3) wp_relatedposts_type parameter.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
