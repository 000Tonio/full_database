The browser engine in Mozilla Firefox before 8.0 and Thunderbird before 8.0 does not properly handle links from SVG mpath elements to non-SVG elements, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors.
