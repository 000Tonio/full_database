Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Symphony CMS 2.2.3 and possibly other versions before 2.2.4 allow remote authenticated users with Author privileges to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the profile parameter to extensions/profiledevkit/content/content.profile.php, as demonstrated via requests to (a) the default URI, (b) about/, or (c) drafts/; or (2) the filter parameter in symphony/lib/core/class.symphony.php, as demonstrated via requests to (d) symphony/publish/comments or (e) symphony/publish/images.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
