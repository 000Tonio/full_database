Multiple buffer overflows in OpenLDAP2 (OpenLDAP 2) 2.2.0 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) long -t or -r parameters to slurpd, (2) a malicious ldapfilter.conf file that is not properly handled by getfilter functions, (3) a malicious ldaptemplates.conf that causes an overflow in libldap, (4) a certain access control list that causes an overflow in slapd, or (5) a long generated filename for logging rejected replication requests.
