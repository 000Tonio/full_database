# CVE-2002-1367

- Published: 2002-12-26T05:00:00

Common Unix Printing System (CUPS) 1.1.14 through 1.1.17 allows remote attackers to add printers without authentication via a certain UDP packet, which can then be used to perform unauthorized activities such as stealing the local root certificate for the administration server via a "need authorization" page, as demonstrated by new-coke.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
