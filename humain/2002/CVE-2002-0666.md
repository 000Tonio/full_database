# CVE-2002-0666

- Published: 2002-11-04T05:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-10T19:12:00

IPSEC implementations including (1) FreeS/WAN and (2) KAME do not properly calculate the length of authentication data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (kernel panic) via spoofed, short Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) packets, which result in integer signedness errors.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
