The virtual memory management system in FreeBSD 4.5-RELEASE and earlier does not properly check the existence of a VM object during page invalidation, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) by calling msync on an unaccessed memory map created with MAP_ANON and MAP_NOSYNC flags.
