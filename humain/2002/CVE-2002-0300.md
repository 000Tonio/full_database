gnujsp 1.0.0 and 1.0.1 allows remote attackers to list directories, read source code of certain scripts, and bypass access restrictions by directly requesting the target file from the gnujsp servlet, which does not work around a limitation of JServ and does not process the requested file.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| --- | --- | --- |
