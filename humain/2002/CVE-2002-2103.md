- Published: 2002-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T20:32:00

Apache before 1.3.24, when writing to the log file, records a spoofed hostname from the reverse lookup of an IP address, even when a double-reverse lookup fails, which allows remote attackers to hide the original source of activities.

### CVSS Score: **5**
