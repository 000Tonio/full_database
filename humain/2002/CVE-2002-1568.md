# CVE-2002-1568

- Published: 2003-11-17T05:00:00

- Modified: 2016-10-18T02:27:00

OpenSSL 0.9.6e uses assertions when detecting buffer overflow attacks instead of less severe mechanisms, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via certain messages that cause OpenSSL to abort from a failed assertion, as demonstrated using SSLv2 CLIENT_MASTER_KEY messages, which are not properly handled in s2_srvr.c.
