Internet Explorer 5.01 through 6.0 does not properly check certain parameters of a PNG file when opening it, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) by triggering a heap-based buffer overflow using invalid length codes during decompression, aka "Malformed PNG Image File Failure."
