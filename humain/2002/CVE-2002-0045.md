slapd in OpenLDAP 2.0 through 2.0.19 allows local users, and anonymous users before 2.0.8, to conduct a "replace" action on access controls without any values, which causes OpenLDAP to delete non-mandatory attributes that would otherwise be protected by ACLs.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |
