Cross-site scripting vulnerability in phpBB 2.0.0 (phpBB2) allows remote attackers to execute Javascript as other phpBB users by including a http:// and a double-quote (") in the [IMG] tag, which bypasses phpBB's security check, terminates the src parameter of the resulting HTML IMG tag, and injects the script.
