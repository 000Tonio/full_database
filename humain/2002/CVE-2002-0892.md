- Published: 2002-10-04T04:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T20:29:00

The default configuration of NewAtlanta ServletExec ISAPI 4.1 allows remote attackers to determine the path of the web root via a direct request to com.newatlanta.servletexec.JSP10Servlet without a filename, which leaks the pathname in an error message.

### CVSS Score: **5**
