# CVE-2002-0082

- Published: 2002-03-15T05:00:00

- Modified: 2016-10-18T02:16:00

The dbm and shm session cache code in mod_ssl before 2.8.7-1.3.23, and Apache-SSL before 1.3.22+1.46, does not properly initialize memory using the i2d_SSL_SESSION function, which allows remote attackers to use a buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code via a large client certificate that is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA), which produces a large serialized session.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
