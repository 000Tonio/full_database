FreeBSD 4.5 and earlier, and possibly other BSD-based operating systems, allows local users to write to or read from restricted files by closing the file descriptors 0 (standard input), 1 (standard output), or 2 (standard error), which may then be reused by a called setuid process that intended to perform I/O on normal files.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
