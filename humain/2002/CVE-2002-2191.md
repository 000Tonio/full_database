Lotus Domino 5.0.9a and earlier, even when configured with the 'DominoNoBanner=1' option, allows remote attackers to obtain potential sensitive information such as the version via a request for a non-existent .nsf database, which leaks the version in the HTTP banner. This issue is present on Lotus Domino Server with the 'DominoNoBanner' set to a value of '1'.
