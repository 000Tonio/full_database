# CVE-2002-0759

- Published: 2002-08-12T04:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T20:28:00

bzip2 before 1.0.2 in FreeBSD 4.5 and earlier, OpenLinux 3.1 and 3.1.1, and possibly other operating systems, does not use the O_EXCL flag to create files during decompression and does not warn the user if an existing file would be overwritten, which could allow attackers to overwrite files via a bzip2 archive.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
