XChat 1.8.7 and earlier, including default configurations of 1.4.2 and 1.4.3, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary IRC commands as other clients via encoded characters in a PRIVMSG command that calls CTCP PING, which expands the characters in the client response when the percascii variable is set.
