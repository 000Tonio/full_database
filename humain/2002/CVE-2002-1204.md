Netscape Communicator 4.x allows attackers to use a link to steal a user's preferences, including potentially sensitive information such as URL history, e-mail address, and possibly the e-mail password, by redefining the user_pref() function and accessing the prefs.js file, which is stored in a directory with a predictable name.
