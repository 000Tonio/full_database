bigsam_guestbook.php for Big Sam (Built-In Guestbook Stand-Alone Module) 1.1.08 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) or obtain the absolute path of the web server via a displayBegin parameter with a very large number, which leaks the web path in an error message when PHP safe_mode is enabled, or consumes resources when safe_mode is not enabled.
