Microsoft Windows 2000 running the Terminal Server 90-day trial version, and possibly other versions, does not apply group policies to incoming users when the number of connections to the SYSVOL share exceeds the maximum, e.g. with a maximum number of licenses, which can allow remote authenticated users to bypass group policies.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
