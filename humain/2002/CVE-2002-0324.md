Greymatter 1.21c and earlier with the Bookmarklet feature enabled allows remote attackers to read a cleartext password and gain administrative privileges by guessing the name of a gmrightclick-*.reg file which contains the administrator name and password in cleartext, then retrieving the file from the web server before the Greymatter administrator performs a "Clear And Exit" action.
