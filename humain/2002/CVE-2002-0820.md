# CVE-2002-0820

- Published: 2002-08-12T04:00:00

- Modified: 2016-10-18T02:22:00

FreeBSD kernel 4.6 and earlier closes the file descriptors 0, 1, and 2 after they have already been assigned to /dev/null when the descriptors reference procfs or linprocfs, which could allow local users to reuse the file descriptors in a setuid or setgid program to modify critical data and gain privileges.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
