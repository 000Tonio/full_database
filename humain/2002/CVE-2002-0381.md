- Published: 2002-06-25T04:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T20:27:00

The TCP implementation in various BSD operating systems (tcp_input.c) does not properly block connections to broadcast addresses, which could allow remote attackers to bypass intended filters via packets with a unicast link layer address and an IP broadcast address.

### CVSS Score: **5**
