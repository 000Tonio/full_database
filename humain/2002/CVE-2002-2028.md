The screensaver on Windows NT 4.0, 2000, XP, and 2002 does not verify if a domain account has already been locked when a valid password is provided, which makes it easier for users with physical access to conduct brute force password guessing.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |
