Buffer overflows in Squid before 2.4.STABLE6 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code (1) via the MSNT auth helper (msnt_auth) when using denyusers or allowusers files, (2) via the gopher client, or (3) via the FTP server directory listing parser when HTML output is generated.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
