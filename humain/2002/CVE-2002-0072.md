- Published: 2002-04-22T04:00:00

The w3svc.dll ISAPI filter in Front Page Server Extensions and ASP.NET for Internet Information Server (IIS) 4.0, 5.0, and 5.1 does not properly handle the error condition when a long URL is provided, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) when the URL parser accesses a null pointer.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
