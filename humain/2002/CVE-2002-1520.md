- Published: 2003-04-02T05:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T20:30:00

The CLI interface for WatchGuard Firebox Vclass 3.2 and earlier, and RSSA Appliance 3.0.2, does not properly close the SSH connection when a -N option is provided during authentication, which allows remote attackers to access CLI with administrator privileges.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
