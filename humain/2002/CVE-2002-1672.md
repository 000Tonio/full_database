Webmin 0.92, when installed from an RPM, creates /var/webmin with insecure permissions (world readable), which could allow local users to read the root user's cookie-based authentication credentials and possibly hijack the root user's session using the credentials.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
