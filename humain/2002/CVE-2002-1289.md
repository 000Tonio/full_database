The Microsoft Java implementation, as used in Internet Explorer, allows remote attackers to read restricted process memory, cause a denial of service (crash), and possibly execute arbitrary code via the getNativeServices function, which creates an instance of the com.ms.awt.peer.INativeServices (INativeServices) class, whose methods do not verify the memory addresses that are passed as parameters.
