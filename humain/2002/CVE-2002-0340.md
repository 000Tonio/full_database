Windows Media Player (WMP) 8.00.00.4477, and possibly other versions, automatically detects and executes .wmf and other content, even when the file's extension or content type does not specify .wmf, which could make it easier for attackers to conduct unauthorized activities via Trojan horse files containing .wmf content.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
