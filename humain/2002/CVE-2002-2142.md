An undocumented extension for the Servlet mappings in the Servlet 2.3 specification, when upgrading to WebLogic Server and Express 7.0 Service Pack 1 from BEA WebLogic Server and Express 6.0 through 7.0.0.1, does not prepend a "/" character in certain URL patterns, which prevents the proper enforcement of role mappings and policies in applications that use the extension.
