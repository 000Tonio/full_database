Lotus Domino server 5.0.8 with NoBanner enabled allows remote attackers to (1) determine the physical path of the server via a request for a nonexistent file with a .pl (Perl) extension, which leaks the pathname in the error message, or (2) make any request that causes an HTTP 500 error, which leaks the server's version name in the HTTP error message.
