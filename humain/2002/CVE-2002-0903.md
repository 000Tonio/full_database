register.php for WoltLab Burning Board (wbboard) 1.1.1 uses a small number of random values for the "code" parameter that is provided to action.php to approve a new registration, along with predictable new user ID's, which allows remote attackers to hijack new user accounts via a brute force attack on the new user ID and the code value.
