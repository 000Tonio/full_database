The default configuration of Name Service Cache Daemon (nscd) in Caldera OpenLinux 3.1 and 3.1.1 uses cached PTR records instead of consulting the authoritative DNS server for the A record, which could make it easier for remote attackers to bypass applications that restrict access based on host names.
