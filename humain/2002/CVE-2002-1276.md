# CVE-2002-1276

- Published: 2002-11-29T05:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T20:30:00

An incomplete fix for a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in SquirrelMail 1.2.8 calls the strip_tags function on the PHP_SELF value but does not save the result back to that variable, leaving it open to cross-site scripting attacks.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
