The SYN cache (syncache) and SYN cookie (syncookie) mechanism in FreeBSD 4.5 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) (1) via a SYN packet that is accepted using syncookies that causes a null pointer to be referenced for the socket's TCP options, or (2) by killing and restarting a process that listens on the same socket, which does not properly clear the old inpcb pointer on restart.

### CVSS Score: **5**
