Nortel Alteon ACEdirector WebOS 9.0, with the Server Load Balancing (SLB) and Cookie-Based Persistence features enabled, allows remote attackers to determine the real IP address of a web server with a half-closed session, which causes ACEdirector to send packets from the server without changing the address to the virtual IP address.
