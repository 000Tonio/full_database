The administrative web interface (STEMWADM) for SurfControl SuperScout Email Filter allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion) via a GET request without the terminating /r/n/r/n (CRLF) sequence, which causes the interface to wait for the sequence and blocks other users from accessing it.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| --- | --- | --- |

| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
