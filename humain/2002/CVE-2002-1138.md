Microsoft SQL Server 7.0 and 2000, including Microsoft Data Engine (MSDE) 1.0 and Microsoft Desktop Engine (MSDE) 2000, writes output files for scheduled jobs under its own privileges instead of the entity that launched it, which allows attackers to overwrite system files, aka "Flaw in Output File Handling for Scheduled Jobs."
