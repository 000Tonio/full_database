The Microsoft Java virtual machine (VM) build 5.0.3805 and earlier, as used in Internet Explorer, allows remote attackers to extend the Standard Security Manager (SSM) class (com.ms.security.StandardSecurityManager) and bypass intended StandardSecurityManager restrictions by modifying the (1) deniedDefinitionPackages or (2) deniedAccessPackages settings, causing a denial of service by adding Java applets to the list of applets that are prevented from running.
