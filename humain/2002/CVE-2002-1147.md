# CVE-2002-1147

- Published: 2002-10-11T04:00:00

- Modified: 2016-10-18T02:24:00

The HTTP administration interface for HP Procurve 4000M Switch firmware before C.09.16, with stacking features and remote administration enabled, does not authenticate requests to reset the device, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a direct request to the device_reset CGI program. Successful exploitation requires that stacking features and remote administration are enabled.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
