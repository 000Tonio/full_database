- Published: 2002-05-31T04:00:00

pforum 1.14 and earlier does not explicitly enable PHP magic quotes, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and gain administrator privileges via an SQL injection attack when the PHP server is not configured to use magic quotes by default.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
