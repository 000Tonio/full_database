The wizard in KGPG 0.6 through 0.8.2 does not properly provide the passphrase to gpg when creating new keys, which causes secret keys to be created with an empty passphrase and allows local attackers to steal the keys if they can be read.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
