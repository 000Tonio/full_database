# CVE-2002-1658

- Published: 2002-12-31T05:00:00

Buffer overflow in htdigest in Apache 1.3.26 and 1.3.27 may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long user argument.  NOTE: since htdigest is normally only locally accessible and not setuid or setgid, there are few attack vectors which would lead to an escalation of privileges, unless htdigest is executed from a CGI program. Therefore this may not be a vulnerability.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
