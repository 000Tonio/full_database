# CVE-2002-0422

- Published: 2002-08-12T04:00:00

IIS 5 and 5.1 supporting WebDAV methods allows remote attackers to determine the internal IP address of the system (which may be obscured by NAT) via (1) a PROPFIND HTTP request with a blank Host header, which leaks the address in an HREF property in a 207 Multi-Status response, or (2) via the WRITE or MKCOL method, which leaks the IP in the Location server header.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
