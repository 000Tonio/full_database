# CVE-2002-0638

- Published: 2002-08-12T04:00:00

- Modified: 2016-10-18T02:20:00

setpwnam.c in the util-linux package, as included in Red Hat Linux 7.3 and earlier, and other operating systems, does not properly lock a temporary file when modifying /etc/passwd, which may allow local users to gain privileges via a complex race condition that uses an open file descriptor in utility programs such as chfn and chsh.

### CVSS Score: **6.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | LOCAL |
