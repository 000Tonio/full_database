# CVE-2002-0761

- Published: 2002-08-12T04:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T20:28:00

bzip2 before 1.0.2 in FreeBSD 4.5 and earlier, OpenLinux 3.1 and 3.1.1, and possibly systems, uses the permissions of symbolic links instead of the actual files when creating an archive, which could cause the files to be extracted with less restrictive permissions than intended.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
