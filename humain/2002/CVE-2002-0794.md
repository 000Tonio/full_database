# CVE-2002-0794

- Published: 2002-08-12T04:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T20:28:00

The accept_filter mechanism in FreeBSD 4 through 4.5 does not properly remove entries from the incomplete listen queue when adding a syncache, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (network service availability) via a large number of connection attempts, which fills the queue.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
