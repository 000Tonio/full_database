# CVE-2002-2316

- Published: 2002-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T20:32:00

Cisco Catalyst 4000 series switches running CatOS 5.5.5, 6.3.5, and 7.1.2 do not always learn MAC addresses from a single initial packet, which causes unicast traffic to be broadcast across the switch and allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive network information by sniffing.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
