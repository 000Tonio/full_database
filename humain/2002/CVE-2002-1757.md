PHProjekt 2.0 through 3.1 relies on the $PHP_SELF variable for authentication, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication for scripts via a request to a .php file with "sms" in the URL, which is included in the PATH_INFO portion of the $PHP_SELF variable, as demonstrated using "mail_send.php/sms".

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
