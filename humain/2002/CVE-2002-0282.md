DCP-Portal 3.7 through 4.5 allows remote attackers to obtain the physical path of the server via (1) a direct request to add_user.php, or via an invalid new_language parameter in (2) contents.php, (3) categories.php, or (4) files.php, which leaks the path in an error message.

### CVSS Score: **5**
