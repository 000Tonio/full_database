- Published: 2002-06-25T04:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-10T19:11:00

The ASN.1 parser in Ethereal 0.9.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a certain malformed packet, which causes Ethereal to allocate memory incorrectly, possibly due to zero-length fields.

### CVSS Score: **5**
