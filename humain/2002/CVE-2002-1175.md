# CVE-2002-1175

- Published: 2002-10-11T04:00:00

- Modified: 2016-10-18T02:24:00

The getmxrecord function in Fetchmail 6.0.0 and earlier does not properly check the boundary of a particular malformed DNS packet from a malicious DNS server, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) when Fetchmail attempts to read data beyond the expected boundary.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
