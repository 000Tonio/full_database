The web interface for Pingtel xpressa SIP-based voice-over-IP phone 1.2.5 through 1.2.7.4 allows administrators to cause a denial of service by modifying the SIP_AUTHENTICATE_SCHEME value to force authentication of incoming calls, which does not notify the user when an authentication failure occurs.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
