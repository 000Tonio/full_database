# CVE-2002-1490

- Published: 2003-04-02T05:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T20:30:00

NetBSD 1.4 through 1.6 beta allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel panic) via a series of calls to the TIOCSCTTY ioctl, which causes an integer overflow in a structure counter and sets the counter to zero, which frees memory that is still in use by other processes.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
