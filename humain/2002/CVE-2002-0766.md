# CVE-2002-0766

- Published: 2002-08-12T04:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-10T19:12:00

OpenBSD 2.9 through 3.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion) and gain root privileges by filling the kernel's file descriptor table and closing file descriptors 0, 1, or 2 before executing a privileged process, which is not properly handled when OpenBSD fails to open an alternate descriptor.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
