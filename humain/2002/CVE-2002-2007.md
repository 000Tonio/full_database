# CVE-2002-2007

The default installations of Apache Tomcat 3.2.3 and 3.2.4 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive system information such as directory listings and web root path, via erroneous HTTP requests for Java Server Pages (JSP) in the (1) test/jsp, (2) samples/jsp and (3) examples/jsp directories, or the (4) test/realPath.jsp servlet, which leaks pathnames in error messages.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
