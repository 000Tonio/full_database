# CVE-2002-1850

- Published: 2002-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2016-10-18T02:27:00

mod_cgi in Apache 2.0.39 and 2.0.40 allows local users and possibly remote attackers to cause a denial of service (hang and memory consumption) by causing a CGI script to send a large amount of data to stderr, which results in a read/write deadlock between httpd and the CGI script.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
