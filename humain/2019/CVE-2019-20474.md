An issue was discovered in Zoho ManageEngine Remote Access Plus 10.0.447. The service to test the mail-server configuration suffers from an authorization issue allowing a user with the Guest role (read-only access) to use and abuse it. One of the abuses allows performing network and port scan operations of the localhost or the hosts on the same network segment, aka SSRF.
