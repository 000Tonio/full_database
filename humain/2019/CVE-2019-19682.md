nopCommerce through 4.20 allows XSS in the SaveStoreMappings of the components \Presentation\Nop.Web\Areas\Admin\Controllers\NewsController.cs and \Presentation\Nop.Web\Areas\Admin\Controllers\BlogController.cs via Body or Full to Admin/News/NewsItemEdit/[id] Admin/Blog/BlogPostEdit/[id]. NOTE: the vendor reportedly considers this a "feature" because the affected components are an HTML content editor.
