An issue was discovered in atillk64.sys in AMD ATI Diagnostics Hardware Abstraction Sys/Overclocking Utility 5.11.9.0. The vulnerable driver exposes a wrmsr instruction and does not properly filter the Model Specific Register (MSR). Allowing arbitrary MSR writes can lead to Ring-0 code execution and escalation of privileges.
