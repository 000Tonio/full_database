An issue was discovered on Mitsubishi Electric ME-RTU devices through 2.02 and INEA ME-RTU devices through 3.0. Stored cleartext passwords could allow an unauthenticated attacker to obtain configured username and password combinations on the RTU due to the weak credentials management on the RTU. An unauthenticated user can obtain the exposed password credentials to gain access to the following services: DDNS service, Mobile Network Provider, and OpenVPN service.
