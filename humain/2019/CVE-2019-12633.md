A vulnerability in Cisco Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass access controls and conduct a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack on a targeted system. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input on the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending the user of the web application a crafted request. If the request is processed, the attacker could access the system and perform unauthorized actions.
