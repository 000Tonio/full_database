An exploitable privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the iw_console functionality of the Moxa AWK-3131A firmware version 1.13. A specially crafted menu selection string can cause an escape from the restricted console, resulting in system access as the root user. An attacker can send commands while authenticated as a low privilege user to trigger this vulnerability.
