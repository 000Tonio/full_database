# CVE-2019-14889

- Published: 2019-12-10T23:15:00

- Modified: 2023-02-01T20:16:00

A flaw was found with the libssh API function ssh_scp_new() in versions before 0.9.3 and before 0.8.8. When the libssh SCP client connects to a server, the scp command, which includes a user-provided path, is executed on the server-side. In case the library is used in a way where users can influence the third parameter of the function, it would become possible for an attacker to inject arbitrary commands, leading to a compromise of the remote target.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**
