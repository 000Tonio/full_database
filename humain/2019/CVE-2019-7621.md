Kibana versions before 6.8.6 and 7.5.1 contain a cross site scripting (XSS) flaw in the coordinate and region map visualizations. An attacker with the ability to create coordinate map visualizations could create a malicious visualization. If another Kibana user views that visualization or a dashboard containing the visualization it could execute JavaScript in the victimï¿½s browser.
