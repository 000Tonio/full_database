Receipt of a specific packet on the out-of-band management interface fxp0 may cause the system to crash and restart (vmcore). By continuously sending a specially crafted packet to the fxp0 interface, an attacker can repetitively crash the rpd process causing prolonged Denial of Service (DoS). Affected releases are Juniper Networks SRX5000 Series: 12.1X46 versions prior to 12.1X46-D82; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D80; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D160.
