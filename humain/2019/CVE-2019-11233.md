EXCELLENT INFOTEK BiYan v1.57 ~ v2.8 allows an attacker to leak user information without being authenticated, by sending a LOGIN_ID element to the auth/main/asp/check_user_login_info.aspx URI, and then reading the response, as demonstrated by the KW_EMAIL or KW_TEL field.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
