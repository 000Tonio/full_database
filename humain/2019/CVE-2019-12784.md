An issue was discovered in Verint Impact 360 15.1. At wfo/control/signin, the login form can accept submissions from external websites. In conjunction with CVE-2019-12783, this can be used by attackers to "crowdsource" bruteforce login attempts on the target site, allowing them to guess and potentially compromise valid credentials without ever sending any traffic from their own machine to the target site.
