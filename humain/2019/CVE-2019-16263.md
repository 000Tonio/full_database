# CVE-2019-16263

- Published: 2019-10-07T12:15:00

- Modified: 2019-10-09T17:45:00

The Twitter Kit framework through 3.4.2 for iOS does not properly validate the api.twitter.com SSL certificate. Although the certificate chain must contain one of a set of pinned certificates, there are certain implementation errors such as a lack of hostname verification. NOTE: this is an end-of-life product.
