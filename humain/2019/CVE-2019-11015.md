A vulnerability was found in the MIUI OS version 10.1.3.0 that allows a physically proximate attacker to bypass Lockscreen based authentication via the Wallpaper Carousel application to obtain sensitive Clipboard data and the user's stored credentials (partially). This occurs because of paste access to a social media login page.
