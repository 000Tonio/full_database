The Keybase app 2.13.2 for iOS provides potentially insufficient notice that it is employing a user's private key to sign a certain cryptocurrency attestation (that an address at keybase.io can be used for Stellar payments to the user), which might be incompatible with a user's personal position on the semantics of an attestation.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| --- | --- | --- |
