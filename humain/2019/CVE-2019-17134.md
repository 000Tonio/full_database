Amphora Images in OpenStack Octavia >=0.10.0 <2.1.2, >=3.0.0 <3.2.0, >=4.0.0 <4.1.0 allows anyone with access to the management network to bypass client-certificate based authentication and retrieve information or issue configuration commands via simple HTTP requests to the Agent on port https/9443, because the cmd/agent.py gunicorn cert_reqs option is True but is supposed to be ssl.CERT_REQUIRED.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
