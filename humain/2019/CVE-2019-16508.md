# CVE-2019-16508

- Published: 2019-10-01T12:15:00

The Imagination Technologies driver for Chrome OS before R74-11895.B, R75 before R75-12105.B, and R76 before R76-12208.0.0 allows attackers to trigger an Integer Overflow and gain privileges via a malicious application. This occurs because of intentional access for the GPU process to /dev/dri/card1 and the PowerVR ioctl handler, as demonstrated by PVRSRVBridgeSyncPrimOpCreate.
