The user password via the registration form of TronLink Wallet 2.2.0 is stored in the log when the class CreateWalletTwoActivity is called. Other authenticated users can read it in the log later. The logged data can be read using Logcat on the device. When using platforms prior to Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean), the log data is not sandboxed per application; any application installed on the device has the capability to read data logged by other applications.
