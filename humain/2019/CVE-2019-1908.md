A vulnerability in the Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) implementation of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive system information. The vulnerability is due to insufficient security restrictions imposed by the affected software.
