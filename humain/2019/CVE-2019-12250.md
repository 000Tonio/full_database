** DISPUTED ** IdentityServer IdentityServer4 through 2.4 has stored XSS via the httpContext to the host/Extensions/RequestLoggerMiddleware.cs LogForErrorContext method, which can be triggered by viewing a log. NOTE: the software maintainer disputes that this is a vulnerability because the request logger is not part of IdentityServer but only our development test host.
