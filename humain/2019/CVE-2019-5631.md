The Rapid7 InsightAppSec broker suffers from a DLL injection vulnerability in the 'prunsrv.exe' component of the product. If exploited, a local user of the system (who must already be authenticated to the operating system) can elevate their privileges with this vulnerability to the privilege level of InsightAppSec (usually, SYSTEM). This issue affects version 2019.06.24 and prior versions of the product.
