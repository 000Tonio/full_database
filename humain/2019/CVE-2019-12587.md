The EAP peer implementation in Espressif ESP-IDF 2.0.0 through 4.0.0 and ESP8266_NONOS_SDK 2.2.0 through 3.1.0 allows the installation of a zero Pairwise Master Key (PMK) after the completion of any EAP authentication method, which allows attackers in radio range to replay, decrypt, or spoof frames via a rogue access point.

### CVSS Score: **4.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
