Improper Access Control in the RCP+ server of the Bosch Video Recording Manager (VRM) component allows arbitrary and unauthenticated access to a limited subset of certificates, stored in the underlying Microsoft Windows operating system. The fixed versions implement modified authentication checks. Prior releases of VRM software version 3.70 are considered unaffected. This vulnerability affects VRM v3.70.x, v3.71 < v3.71.0034 and v3.81 < 3.81.0050; DIVAR IP 5000 3.80 < 3.80.0039; BVMS all versions using VRM.
