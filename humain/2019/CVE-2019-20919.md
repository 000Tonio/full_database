# CVE-2019-20919

- Published: 2020-09-17T18:15:00

- Modified: 2022-04-28T18:33:00

An issue was discovered in the DBI module before 1.643 for Perl. The hv_fetch() documentation requires checking for NULL and the code does that. But, shortly thereafter, it calls SvOK(profile), causing a NULL pointer dereference.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
