# CVE-2019-14232

- Published: 2019-08-02T15:15:00

- Modified: 2020-08-24T17:37:00

An issue was discovered in Django 1.11.x before 1.11.23, 2.1.x before 2.1.11, and 2.2.x before 2.2.4. If django.utils.text.Truncator's chars() and words() methods were passed the html=True argument, they were extremely slow to evaluate certain inputs due to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability in a regular expression. The chars() and words() methods are used to implement the truncatechars_html and truncatewords_html template filters, which were thus vulnerable.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
