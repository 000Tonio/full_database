An issue was discovered on Sannce Smart HD Wifi Security Camera EAN 2 950004 595317 devices. A crash and reboot can be triggered by crafted IP traffic, as demonstrated by the Nikto vulnerability scanner. For example, sending the 111111 string to UDP port 20188 causes a reboot. To deny service for a long time period, the crafted IP traffic may be sent periodically.
