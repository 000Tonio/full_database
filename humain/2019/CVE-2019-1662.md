A vulnerability in the Quality of Voice Reporting (QOVR) service of Cisco Prime Collaboration Assurance (PCA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access the system as a valid user. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authentication controls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the QOVR service with a valid username. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform actions with the privileges of the user that is used for access. This vulnerability affects Cisco PCA Software Releases prior to 12.1 SP2.
