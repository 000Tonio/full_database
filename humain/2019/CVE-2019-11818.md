Alkacon OpenCMS v10.5.4 and before is affected by stored cross site scripting (XSS) in the module New User (/opencms/system/workplace/admin/accounts/user_new.jsp). This allows an attacker to insert arbitrary JavaScript as user input (First Name or Last Name), which will be executed whenever the affected snippet is loaded.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
