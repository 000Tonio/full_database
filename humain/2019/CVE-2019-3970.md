Comodo Antivirus versions up to 12.0.0.6810 are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write due to Cavwp.exe handling of Comodo's Antivirus database. Cavwp.exe loads Comodo antivirus definition database in unsecured global section objects, allowing a local low privileged process to modify this data directly and change virus signatures.
