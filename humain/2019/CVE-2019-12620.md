A vulnerability in the statistics collection service of Cisco HyperFlex Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary values on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authentication for the statistics collection service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending properly formatted data values to the statistics collection service of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the web interface statistics view to present invalid data to users.
