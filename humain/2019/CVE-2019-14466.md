The GOsa_Filter_Settings cookie in GONICUS GOsa 2.7.5.2 is vulnerable to PHP objection injection, which allows a remote authenticated attacker to perform file deletions (in the context of the user account that runs the web server) via a crafted cookie value, because unserialize is used to restore filter settings from a cookie.
