In Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus 5.x through 5704, an authorization.do cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability allows for an unauthenticated manipulation of the JavaScript code by injecting the HTTP form parameter adscsrf. An attacker can use this to capture a user's AD self-service password reset and MFA token.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
