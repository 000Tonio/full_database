An issue was discovered in the secure portal in Publisure 2.1.2. Once successfully authenticated as an administrator, one is able to inject arbitrary PHP code by using the adminCons.php form. The code is then stored in the E:\PUBLISURE\webservice\webpages\AdminDir\Templates\ folder even if removed from the adminCons.php view (i.e., the rogue PHP file can be hidden).

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
