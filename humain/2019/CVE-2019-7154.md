# CVE-2019-7154

- Published: 2019-01-29T00:29:00

The main function in tools/wasm2js.cpp in Binaryen 1.38.22 has a heap-based buffer overflow because Emscripten is misused, triggering an error in cashew::JSPrinter::printAst() in emscripten-optimizer/simple_ast.h. A crafted input can cause segmentation faults, leading to denial-of-service, as demonstrated by wasm2js.
