The Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce and Abandoned Cart Pro for WooCommerce plugins for WordPress are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via multiple parameters in versions up to, and including, 5.1.3 and 7.12.0 respectively, due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in user input that will execute on the admin dashboard.
