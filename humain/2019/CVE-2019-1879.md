A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input at the CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating with the administrator password via the CLI of an affected device and submitting crafted input to the affected commands. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges.
