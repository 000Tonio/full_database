# CVE-2019-9872

In several versions of JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, creating run configurations for cloud application servers leads to saving a cleartext unencrypted record of the server credentials in the IDE configuration files. If the Settings Repository plugin was then used and configured to synchronize IDE settings using a public repository, these credentials were published to this repository. The issue has been fixed in the following versions: 2019.1, 2018.3.5, 2018.2.8, and 2018.1.8.
