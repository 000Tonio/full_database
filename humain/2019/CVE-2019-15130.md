The Recruitment module in Humanica Humatrix 7 1.0.0.203 and 1.0.0.681 allows an unauthenticated attacker to upload any file type to a candidate's profile picture folder via a crafted recruitment_online/personalData/act_personaltab.cfm multiple-part POST request with a predictable WRC01_USERID parameter. Moreover, the attacker can upload executable content (e.g., asp or aspx) for executing OS commands on the server.
