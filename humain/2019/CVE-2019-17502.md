# CVE-2019-17502

- Published: 2019-10-12T20:15:00

Hydra through 0.1.8 has a NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash when processing POST requests that lack a Content-Length header. read.c, request.c, and util.c contribute to this. The process_header_end() function calls boa_atoi(), which ultimately calls atoi() on a NULL pointer.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
