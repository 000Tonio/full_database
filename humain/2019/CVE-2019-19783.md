# CVE-2019-19783

- Published: 2019-12-16T14:15:00

- Modified: 2022-05-03T14:27:00

An issue was discovered in Cyrus IMAP before 2.5.15, 3.0.x before 3.0.13, and 3.1.x through 3.1.8. If sieve script uploading is allowed (3.x) or certain non-default sieve options are enabled (2.x), a user with a mail account on the service can use a sieve script containing a fileinto directive to create any mailbox with administrator privileges, because of folder mishandling in autosieve_createfolder() in imap/lmtp_sieve.c.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| --- | --- | --- |
