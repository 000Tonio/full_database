# CVE-2019-16964

- Published: 2019-10-21T19:15:00

- Modified: 2020-08-24T17:37:00

app/call_centers/cmd.php in the Call Center Queue Module in FusionPBX up to 4.5.7 suffers from a command injection vulnerability due to a lack of input validation, which allows authenticated attackers (with at least the permission call_center_queue_add or call_center_queue_edit) to execute any commands on the host as www-data.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
