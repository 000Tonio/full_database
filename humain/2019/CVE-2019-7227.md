# CVE-2019-7227

- Published: 2019-06-27T16:15:00

- Modified: 2022-11-30T21:41:00

In the ABB IDAL FTP server, an authenticated attacker can traverse to arbitrary directories on the hard disk with "CWD ../" and then use the FTP server functionality to download and upload files. An unauthenticated attacker can take advantage of the hardcoded or default credential pair exor/exor to become an authenticated attacker.

### CVSS Score: **4.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
