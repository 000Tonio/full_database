A vulnerability in the Protocol Independent Multicast (PIM) feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the PIM process to restart, resulting in a denial of service condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect processing of crafted AutoRP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted packets to port UDP 496 on a reachable IP address on the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the PIM process to restart. Software versions prior to 6.2.3, 6.3.2, 6.4.0, and 6.5.1 are affected.
