The Zoom Client before 4.4.53932.0709 on macOS allows remote code execution, a different vulnerability than CVE-2019-13450. If the ZoomOpener daemon (aka the hidden web server) is running, but the Zoom Client is not installed or can't be opened, an attacker can remotely execute code with a maliciously crafted launch URL. NOTE: ZoomOpener is removed by the Apple Malware Removal Tool (MRT) if this tool is enabled and has the 2019-07-10 MRTConfigData.
