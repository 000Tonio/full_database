A vulnerability in the Software Image Management feature of Cisco DNA Center could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access to internal services without additional authentication. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending arbitrary HTTP requests to internal services. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass any firewall or other protections to access unauthorized internal services. DNAC versions prior to 1.2.5 are affected.
