In FreeBSD 12.0-STABLE before r349197 and 12.0-RELEASE before 12.0-RELEASE-p6, a bug in the non-default RACK TCP stack can allow an attacker to cause several linked lists to grow unbounded and cause an expensive list traversal on every packet being processed, leading to resource exhaustion and a denial of service.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
