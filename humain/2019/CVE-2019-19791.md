# CVE-2019-19791

- Published: 2023-05-29T19:15:00

In LemonLDAP::NG (aka lemonldap-ng) before 2.0.7, the default Apache HTTP Server configuration does not properly restrict access to SOAP/REST endpoints (when some LemonLDAP::NG setup options are used). For example, an attacker can insert index.fcgi/index.fcgi into a URL to bypass a Require directive.
