# CVE-2019-11454

- Published: 2019-04-22T16:29:00

- Modified: 2022-03-31T17:43:00

Persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) in http/cervlet.c in Tildeslash Monit before 5.25.3 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to introduce arbitrary JavaScript via manipulation of an unsanitized user field of the Authorization header for HTTP Basic Authentication, which is mishandled during an _viewlog operation.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
