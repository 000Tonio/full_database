# CVE-2019-20794

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 4.18 through 5.6.11 when unprivileged user namespaces are allowed. A user can create their own PID namespace, and mount a FUSE filesystem. Upon interaction with this FUSE filesystem, if the userspace component is terminated via a kill of the PID namespace's pid 1, it will result in a hung task, and resources being permanently locked up until system reboot. This can result in resource exhaustion.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
