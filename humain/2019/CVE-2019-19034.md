Zoho ManageEngine Asset Explorer 6.5 does not validate the System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) database username when dynamically generating a command to schedule scans for SCCM. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the AssetExplorer Server with NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM privileges.
