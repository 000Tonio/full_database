The web application portal of the Cobham EXPLORER 710, firmware version 1.07, allows unauthenticated access to port 5454. This could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to connect to this port via Telnet and execute 86 Attention (AT) commands, including some that provide unauthenticated, shell-like access to the device.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
