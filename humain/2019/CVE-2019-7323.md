# CVE-2019-7323

- Published: 2019-02-04T16:29:00

GUP (generic update process) in LightySoft LogMX before 7.4.0 does not properly verify the authenticity of updates, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to execute arbitrary code via a Trojan horse update. The update process relies on cleartext HTTP. The attacker could replace the LogMXUpdater.class file.
