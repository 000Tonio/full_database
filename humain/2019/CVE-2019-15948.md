Texas Instruments CC256x and WL18xx dual-mode Bluetooth controller devices, when LE scan mode is used, allow remote attackers to trigger a buffer overflow via a malformed Bluetooth Low Energy advertising packet, to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code. This affects CC256xC-BT-SP 1.2, CC256xB-BT-SP 1.8, and WL18xx-BT-SP 4.4.
