# CVE-2019-10147

- Published: 2019-06-03T19:29:00

- Modified: 2020-09-30T14:21:00

rkt through version 1.30.0 does not isolate processes in containers that are run with `rkt enter`. Processes run with `rkt enter` are not limited by cgroups during stage 2 (the actual environment in which the applications run). Compromised containers could exploit this flaw to access host resources.
