An exploitable privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the Wacom, driver version 6.3.32-3, update helper service in the start/stopLaunchDProcess command. The command takes a user-supplied string argument and executes launchctl under root context. A user with local access can use this vulnerability to raise load arbitrary launchD agents. An attacker would need local access to the machine for a successful exploit.
