An issue was discovered on Belkin Wemo Switch 28B WW_2.00.11057.PVT-OWRT-SNS devices. They allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (persistent rules-processing outage) via a crafted ruleDbBody element in a StoreRules request to the upnp/control/rules1 URI, because database corruption occurs.
