A vulnerability in the WebVPN service of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper management of authenticated sessions in the WebVPN portal. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating with valid credentials and accessing a specific URL in the WebVPN portal. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload, resulting in a temporary DoS condition.
