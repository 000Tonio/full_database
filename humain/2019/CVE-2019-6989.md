TP-Link TL-WR940N is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow, caused by improper bounds checking by the ipAddrDispose function. By sending specially crafted ICMP echo request packets, a remote authenticated attacker could overflow a buffer and execute arbitrary code on the system with elevated privileges.
