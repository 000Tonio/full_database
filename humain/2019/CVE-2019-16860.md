Code42 app through version 7.0.2 for Windows has an Untrusted Search Path. In certain situations, a non-administrative attacker on the local machine could create or modify a dynamic-link library (DLL). The Code42 service could then load it at runtime, and potentially execute arbitrary code at an elevated privilege on the local machine.
