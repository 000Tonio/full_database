A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Meetings for Android could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to perform a cross-site scripting attack against the application. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the application input parameters. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious request to the Webex Meetings application through an intent. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute script code in the context of the Webex Meetings application. Versions prior to 11.7.0.236 are affected.
