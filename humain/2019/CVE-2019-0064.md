On SRX5000 Series devices, if 'set security zones security-zone <zone> tcp-rst' is configured, the flowd process may crash when a specific TCP packet is received by the device and triggers a new session. The process restarts automatically. However, receipt of a constant stream of these TCP packets may result in an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition on the device. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 18.2R3 on SRX 5000 Series; 18.4R2 on SRX 5000 Series; 19.2R1 on SRX 5000 Series.
