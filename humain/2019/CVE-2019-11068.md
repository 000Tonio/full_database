# CVE-2019-11068

- Published: 2019-04-10T20:29:00

- Modified: 2020-08-24T17:37:00

libxslt through 1.1.33 allows bypass of a protection mechanism because callers of xsltCheckRead and xsltCheckWrite permit access even upon receiving a -1 error code. xsltCheckRead can return -1 for a crafted URL that is not actually invalid and is subsequently loaded.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
