Dolibarr ERP/CRM 9.0.1 was affected by stored XSS within uploaded files. These vulnerabilities allowed the execution of a JavaScript payload each time any regular user or administrative user clicked on the malicious link hosted on the same domain. The vulnerabilities could be exploited by low privileged users to target administrators. The viewimage.php page did not perform any contextual output encoding and would display the content within the uploaded file with a user-requested MIME type.
