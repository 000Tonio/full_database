# CVE-2019-9792

- Published: 2019-04-26T17:29:00

The IonMonkey just-in-time (JIT) compiler can leak an internal JS_OPTIMIZED_OUT magic value to the running script during a bailout. This magic value can then be used by JavaScript to achieve memory corruption, which results in a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.6, Firefox ESR < 60.6, and Firefox < 66.
