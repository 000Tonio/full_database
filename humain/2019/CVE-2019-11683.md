udp_gro_receive_segment in net/ipv4/udp_offload.c in the Linux kernel 5.x before 5.0.13 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (slab-out-of-bounds memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via UDP packets with a 0 payload, because of mishandling of padded packets, aka the "GRO packet of death" issue.

### CVSS Score: **10**
