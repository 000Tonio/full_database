# CVE-2019-5102

- Published: 2019-11-18T18:15:00

An exploitable information leak vulnerability exists in the ustream-ssl library of OpenWrt, versions 18.06.4 and 15.05.1. When connecting to a remote server, the server's SSL certificate is checked but no action is taken when the certificate is invalid. An attacker could exploit this behavior by performing a man-in-the-middle attack, providing any certificate, leading to the theft of all the data sent by the client during the first request.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
