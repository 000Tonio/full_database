** DISPUTED ** PEGA Platform 8.3.0 is vulnerable to Information disclosure via a direct prweb/sso/random_token/!STANDARD?pyStream=MyAlerts request to get Audit Log information while using a low-privilege account. NOTE: The vendor states that this vulnerability was discovered using an administrator account and they are normal administrator functions. Therefore, the claim that the CVE was done with a low privilege account is incorrect.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
