The SAP Gateway, versions 7.5, 7.51, 7.52 and 7.53, allows an attacker to inject content which is displayed in the form of an error message. An attacker could thus mislead a user to believe this information is from the legitimate service when it's not.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
