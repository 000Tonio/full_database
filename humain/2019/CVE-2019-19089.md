For ABB eSOMS versions 4.0 to 6.0.3, the X-Content-Type-Options Header is missing in the HTTP response, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as different content type other than declared. A possible attack scenario would be unauthorized code execution via text interpreted as JavaScript.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
