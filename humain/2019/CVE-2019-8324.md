# CVE-2019-8324

- Published: 2019-06-17T19:15:00

- Modified: 2020-08-24T17:37:00

An issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.6 and later through 3.0.2. A crafted gem with a multi-line name is not handled correctly. Therefore, an attacker could inject arbitrary code to the stub line of gemspec, which is eval-ed by code in ensure_loadable_spec during the preinstall check.
