The Chuango 433 MHz burglar-alarm product line is vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. When the condition is triggered, the OV2 base station is unable to process sensor states and effectively prevents the alarm from setting off, as demonstrated by Chuango branded products, and non-Chuango branded products such as the Eminent EM8617 OV2 Wifi Alarm System.
