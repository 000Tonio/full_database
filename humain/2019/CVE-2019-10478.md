An issue was discovered on Glory RBW-100 devices with firmware ISP-K05-02 7.0.0. An unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the Front Circle Controller glytoolcgi/settingfile_upload.cgi allows attackers to upload supplied data. This can be used to place attacker controlled code on the filesystem that can be executed and can lead to a reverse root shell.
