- Published: 2019-07-01T11:15:00

- Modified: 2019-07-30T09:15:00

XSS was discovered in SquirrelMail through 1.4.22 and 1.5.x through 1.5.2. Due to improper handling of RCDATA and RAWTEXT type elements, the built-in sanitization mechanism can be bypassed. Malicious script content from HTML e-mail can be executed within the application context via crafted use of (for example) a NOEMBED, NOFRAMES, NOSCRIPT, or TEXTAREA element.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
