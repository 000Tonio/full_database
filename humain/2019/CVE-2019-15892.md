# CVE-2019-15892

An issue was discovered in Varnish Cache before 6.0.4 LTS, and 6.1.x and 6.2.x before 6.2.1. An HTTP/1 parsing failure allows a remote attacker to trigger an assert by sending crafted HTTP/1 requests. The assert will cause an automatic restart with a clean cache, which makes it a Denial of Service attack.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
