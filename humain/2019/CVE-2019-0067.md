Receipt of a specific link-local IPv6 packet destined to the RE may cause the system to crash and restart (vmcore). By continuously sending a specially crafted IPv6 packet, an attacker can repeatedly crash the system causing a prolonged Denial of Service (DoS). This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R6-S2, 16.1R7; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S10; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R3. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS version 15.1 and prior versions.
