# CVE-2019-6679

- Published: 2019-12-23T18:15:00

On BIG-IP versions 15.0.0-15.0.1, 14.1.0.2-14.1.2.2, 14.0.0.5-14.0.1, 13.1.1.5-13.1.3.1, 12.1.4.1-12.1.5, 11.6.4-11.6.5, and 11.5.9-11.5.10, the access controls implemented by scp.whitelist and scp.blacklist are not properly enforced for paths that are symlinks. This allows authenticated users with SCP access to overwrite certain configuration files that would otherwise be restricted.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| --- | --- | --- |
