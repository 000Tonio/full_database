# CVE-2019-7231

- Published: 2019-06-24T20:15:00

- Modified: 2022-11-30T21:41:00

The ABB IDAL FTP server is vulnerable to a buffer overflow when a long string is sent by an authenticated attacker. This overflow is handled, but terminates the process. An authenticated attacker can send a FTP command string of 472 bytes or more to overflow a buffer, causing an exception that terminates the server.

### CVSS Score: **2.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
