A vulnerability in the web-based UI (web UI) of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attack on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient CSRF protections for the web UI on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user of the interface to follow a malicious link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform arbitrary actions with the privilege level of the affected user. If the user has administrative privileges, the attacker could alter the configuration, execute commands, or reload an affected device. This vulnerability affects Cisco devices that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software with the HTTP Server feature enabled. The default state of the HTTP Server feature is version dependent.
