A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the PowerPoint document conversion function of Rainbow PDF Office Server Document Converter V7.0 Pro MR1 (7,0,2019,0220). While parsing a document text info container, the TxMasterStyleAtom::parse function is incorrectly checking the bounds corresponding to the number of style levels, causing a vtable pointer to be overwritten, which leads to code execution.
