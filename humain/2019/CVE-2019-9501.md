# CVE-2019-9501

- Published: 2020-02-03T21:15:00

The Broadcom wl WiFi driver is vulnerable to a heap buffer overflow. By supplying a vendor information element with a data length larger than 32 bytes, a heap buffer overflow is triggered in wlc_wpa_sup_eapol. In the worst case scenario, by sending specially-crafted WiFi packets, a remote, unauthenticated attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. More typically, this vulnerability will result in denial-of-service conditions.
