A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Unified Communications Domain Manager (Cisco Unified CDM) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escape the restricted shell. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of shell commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by executing crafted commands in the shell. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to escape the restricted shell and access commands in the context of the restricted shell user, which does not have root privileges.
