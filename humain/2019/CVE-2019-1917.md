A vulnerability in the REST API interface of Cisco Vision Dynamic Signage Director could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass authentication on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of HTTP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary actions through the REST API with administrative privileges on the affected system. The REST API is enabled by default and cannot be disabled.
