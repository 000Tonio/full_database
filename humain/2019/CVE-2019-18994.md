Due to a lack of file length check, the HMIStudio component of ABB PB610 Panel Builder 600 versions 2.8.0.424 and earlier crashes when trying to load an empty *.JPR application file. An attacker with access to the file system might be able to cause application malfunction such as denial of service.
