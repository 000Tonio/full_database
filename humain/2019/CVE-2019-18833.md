Barco ClickShare Button R9861500D01 devices before 1.9.0 allow Information exposure (issue 2 of 2).. The encryption key of the media content which is shared between a ClickShare Button and a ClickShare Base Unit is randomly generated for each new session and communicated over a TLS connection. An attacker who is able to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack between the TLS connection, is able to obtain the encryption key.
