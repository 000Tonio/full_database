# CVE-2019-11477

- Published: 2019-06-19T00:15:00

- Modified: 2023-01-17T21:28:00

Jonathan Looney discovered that the TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->tcp_gso_segs value was subject to an integer overflow in the Linux kernel when handling TCP Selective Acknowledgments (SACKs). A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. This has been fixed in stable kernel releases 4.4.182, 4.9.182, 4.14.127, 4.19.52, 5.1.11, and is fixed in commit 3b4929f65b0d8249f19a50245cd88ed1a2f78cff.
