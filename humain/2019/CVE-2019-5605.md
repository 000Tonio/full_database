# CVE-2019-5605

- Published: 2019-07-26T01:15:00

In FreeBSD 11.3-STABLE before r350217, 11.3-RELEASE before 11.3-RELEASE-p1, and 11.2-RELEASE before 11.2-RELEASE-p12, due to insufficient initialization of memory copied to userland in the freebsd32_ioctl interface, small amounts of kernel memory may be disclosed to userland processes. This may allow an attacker to leverage this information to obtain elevated privileges either directly or indirectly.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
