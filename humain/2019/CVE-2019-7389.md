An issue was discovered in /bin/goahead on D-Link DIR-823G devices with the firmware 1.02B03. There is incorrect access control allowing remote attackers to reset the router without authentication via the SetFactoryDefault HNAP API. Consequently, an attacker can achieve a denial-of-service attack without authentication.
