libsoup from versions 2.65.1 until 2.68.1 have a heap-based buffer over-read because soup_ntlm_parse_challenge() in soup-auth-ntlm.c does not properly check an NTLM message's length before proceeding with a memcpy.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
