# CVE-2019-10770

- Published: 2020-01-28T01:15:00

All versions of io.ratpack:ratpack-core from 0.9.10 inclusive and before 1.7.6 are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). This affects the development mode error handler when an exception message contains untrusted data. Note the production mode error handler is not vulnerable - so for this to be utilized in production it would require users to not disable development mode.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
