In Philips IntelliBridge EC40 and EC80, IntelliBridge EC40 Hub all versions, and IntelliBridge EC80 Hub all versions, the SSH server running on the affected products is configured to allow weak ciphers. This could enable an unauthorized attacker with access to the network to capture and replay the session and gain unauthorized access to the EC40/80 hub.
