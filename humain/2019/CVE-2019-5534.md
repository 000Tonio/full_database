VMware vCenter Server (6.7.x prior to 6.7 U3, 6.5 prior to 6.5 U3 and 6.0 prior to 6.0 U3j) contains an information disclosure vulnerability where Virtual Machines deployed from an OVF could expose login information via the virtual machine's vAppConfig properties. A malicious actor with access to query the vAppConfig properties of a virtual machine deployed from an OVF may be able to view the credentials used to deploy the OVF (typically the root account of the virtual machine).
