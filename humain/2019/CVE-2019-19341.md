A flaw was found in Ansible Tower, versions 3.6.x before 3.6.2, where files in '/var/backup/tower' are left world-readable. These files include both the SECRET_KEY and the database backup. Any user with access to the Tower server, and knowledge of when a backup is run, could retrieve every credential stored in Tower. Access to data is the highest threat with this vulnerability.
