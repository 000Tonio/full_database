# CVE-2019-9162

- Published: 2019-02-25T23:29:00

- Modified: 2022-04-05T20:46:00

In the Linux kernel before 4.20.12, net/ipv4/netfilter/nf_nat_snmp_basic_main.c in the SNMP NAT module has insufficient ASN.1 length checks (aka an array index error), making out-of-bounds read and write operations possible, leading to an OOPS or local privilege escalation. This affects snmp_version and snmp_helper.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
