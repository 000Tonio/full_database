In CloudVision Portal all releases in the 2018.1 and 2018.2 Code train allows users with read-only permissions to bypass permissions for restricted functionality via CVP API calls through the Configlet Builder modules. This vulnerability can potentially enable authenticated users with read-only access to take actions that are otherwise restricted in the GUI.
