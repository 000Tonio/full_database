The HTTP client in Gradle before 5.6 sends authentication credentials originally destined for the configured host. If that host returns a 30x redirect, Gradle also sends those credentials to all subsequent hosts that the request redirects to. This is similar to CVE-2018-1000007.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
