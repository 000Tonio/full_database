An Improper Input Validation weakness allows a malicious local attacker to elevate their permissions to take control of other portions of the NFX platform they should not be able to access, and execute commands outside their authorized scope of control. This leads to the attacker being able to take control of the entire system. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 18.2R1 on NFX Series.
