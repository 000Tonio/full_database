- Published: 2019-09-11T22:15:00

An exploitable denial-of-service vulnerability exists in the session handling functionality of the NETGEAR N300 (WNR2000v5 with Firmware Version V1.0.0.70) HTTP server. An HTTP request with an empty User-Agent string sent to a page requiring authentication can cause a null pointer dereference, resulting in the HTTP service crashing. An unauthenticated attacker can send a specially crafted HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
