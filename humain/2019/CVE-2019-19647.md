# CVE-2019-19647

- Published: 2019-12-09T01:15:00

- Modified: 2022-01-01T20:07:00

radare2 through 4.0.0 lacks validation of the content variable in the function r_asm_pseudo_incbin at libr/asm/asm.c, ultimately leading to an arbitrary write. This allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted input.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
