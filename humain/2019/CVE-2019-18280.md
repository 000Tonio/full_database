Sourcecodester Online Grading System 1.0 is affected by a Cross Site Request Forgery vulnerability due to a lack of CSRF protection. This could lead to an attacker tricking the administrator into executing arbitrary code via a crafted HTML page, as demonstrated by a Create User action at the admin/modules/user/controller.php?action=add URI.
