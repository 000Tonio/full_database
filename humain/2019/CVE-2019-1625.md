A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco SD-WAN Solution could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate lower-level privileges to the root user on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization enforcement. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the targeted device and executing commands that could lead to elevated privileges. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to make configuration changes to the system as the root user.
