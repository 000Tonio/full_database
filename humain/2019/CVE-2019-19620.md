In SecureWorks Red Cloak Windows Agent before 2.0.7.9, a local user can bypass the generation of telemetry alerts by removing NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM permissions from a file. This is limited in scope to the collection of process-execution telemetry, for executions against specific files where the SYSTEM user was denied access to the source file.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
