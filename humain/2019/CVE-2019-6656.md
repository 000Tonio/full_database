BIG-IP APM Edge Client before version 7.1.8 (7180.2019.508.705) logs the full apm session ID in the log files. Vulnerable versions of the client are bundled with BIG-IP APM versions 15.0.0-15.0.1, 14,1.0-14.1.0.6, 14.0.0-14.0.0.4, 13.0.0-13.1.1.5, 12.1.0-12.1.5, and 11.5.1-11.6.5. In BIG-IP APM 13.1.0 and later, the APM Clients components can be updated independently from BIG-IP software. Client version 7.1.8 (7180.2019.508.705) and later has the fix.
