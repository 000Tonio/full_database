An issue was discovered in EspoCRM before 5.6.9. Stored XSS was executed inside the title and breadcrumb of a newly formed entity available to all the users. A malicious user can inject JavaScript in these values of an entity, thus stealing user cookies when someone visits the publicly accessible link.
