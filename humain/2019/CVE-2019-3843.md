# CVE-2019-3843

- Published: 2019-04-26T21:29:00

- Modified: 2022-01-31T18:53:00

It was discovered that a systemd service that uses DynamicUser property can create a SUID/SGID binary that would be allowed to run as the transient service UID/GID even after the service is terminated. A local attacker may use this flaw to access resources that will be owned by a potentially different service in the future, when the UID/GID will be recycled.
