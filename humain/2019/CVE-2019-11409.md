# CVE-2019-11409

- Published: 2019-06-17T19:15:00

- Modified: 2022-04-18T17:16:00

app/operator_panel/exec.php in the Operator Panel module in FusionPBX 4.4.3 suffers from a command injection vulnerability due to a lack of input validation that allows authenticated non-administrative attackers to execute commands on the host. This can further lead to remote code execution when combined with an XSS vulnerability also present in the FusionPBX Operator Panel module.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
