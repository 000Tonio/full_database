An issue was discovered in Total.js CMS 12.0.0. An authenticated user with limited privileges can get access to a resource that they do not own by calling the associated API. The product correctly manages privileges only for the front-end resource path, not for API requests. This leads to vertical and horizontal privilege escalation.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
