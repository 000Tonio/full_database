Nessus versions 8.2.1 and earlier were found to contain a stored XSS vulnerability due to improper validation of user-supplied input. An authenticated, remote attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability via a specially crafted request to execute arbitrary script code in a user's browser session. Tenable has released Nessus 8.2.2 to address this issue.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
