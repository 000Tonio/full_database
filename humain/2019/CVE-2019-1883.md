- Published: 2019-08-21T19:15:00

A vulnerability in the command-line interface of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an authenticated, local attacker with read-only credentials to inject arbitrary commands that could allow them to obtain root privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input on the command-line interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating with read-only privileges via the CLI of an affected device and submitting crafted input to the affected commands. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with root privileges.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |
