An issue was discovered in net/ipv4/sysctl_net_ipv4.c in the Linux kernel before 5.0.11. There is a net/ipv4/tcp_input.c signed integer overflow in tcp_ack_update_rtt() when userspace writes a very large integer to /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_min_rtt_wlen, leading to a denial of service or possibly unspecified other impact, aka CID-19fad20d15a6.
