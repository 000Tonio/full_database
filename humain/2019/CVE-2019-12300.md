Buildbot before 1.8.2 and 2.x before 2.3.1 accepts a user-submitted authorization token from OAuth and uses it to authenticate a user. If an attacker has a token allowing them to read the user details of a victim, they can login as the victim.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
