A log poisoning vulnerability has been discovered in the OneShield Policy (Dragon Core) framework before 5.1.10. Authenticated remote adversaries can poison log files by entering malicious payloads in either headers or form elements. These payloads are then executed via a client side debugging console. This is predicated on the debugging console and Java Bean being made available to the deployed application.
