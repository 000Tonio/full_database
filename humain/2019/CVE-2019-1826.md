# CVE-2019-1826

- Published: 2019-04-18T02:29:00

A vulnerability in the quality of service (QoS) feature of Cisco Aironet Series Access Points (APs) could allow an authenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to improper input validation on QoS fields within Wi-Fi frames by the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed Wi-Fi frames to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to crash, resulting in a DoS condition.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |
