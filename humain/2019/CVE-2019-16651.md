# CVE-2019-16651

- Published: 2021-09-20T14:15:00

An issue was discovered on Virgin Media Super Hub 3 (based on ARRIS TG2492) devices. Because their SNMP commands have insufficient protection mechanisms, it is possible to use JavaScript and DNS rebinding to leak the WAN IP address of a user (if they are using certain VPN implementations, this would decloak them).

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |

| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
