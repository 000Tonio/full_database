# CVE-2019-11869

- Published: 2019-05-09T23:29:00

- Modified: 2019-05-13T18:29:00

The Yuzo Related Posts plugin 5.12.94 for WordPress has XSS because it mistakenly expects that is_admin() verifies that the request comes from an admin user (it actually only verifies that the request is for an admin page). An unauthenticated attacker can inject a payload into the plugin settings, such as the yuzo_related_post_css_and_style setting.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
