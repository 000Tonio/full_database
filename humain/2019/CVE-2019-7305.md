Information Exposure vulnerability in eXtplorer makes the /usr/ and /etc/extplorer/ system directories world-accessible over HTTP. Introduced in the Makefile patch file debian/patches/debian-changes-2.1.0b6+dfsg-1 or debian/patches/adds-a-makefile.patch, this can lead to data leakage, information disclosure and potentially remote code execution on the web server. This issue affects all versions of eXtplorer in Ubuntu and Debian
