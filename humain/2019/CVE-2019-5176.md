An exploitable stack buffer overflow vulnerability vulnerability exists in the iocheckd service ‘I/O-Check’ functionality of WAGO PFC 200 Firmware version 03.02.02(14). An attacker can send a specially crafted packet to trigger the parsing of this cache file.The destination buffer sp+0x40 is overflowed with the call to sprintf() for any gateway values that are greater than 512-len(‘/etc/config-tools/config_default_gateway number=0 state=enabled value=‘) in length. A gateway value of length 0x7e2 will cause the service to crash.
