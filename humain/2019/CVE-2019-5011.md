An exploitable privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the helper service CleanMyMac X, version 4.20, due to improper updating. The application failed to remove the vulnerable components upon upgrading to the latest version, leaving the user open to attack. A user with local access can use this vulnerability to modify the file system as root. An attacker would need local access to the machine for a successful exploit.
