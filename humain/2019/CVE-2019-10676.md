An issue was discovered in Uniqkey Password Manager 1.14. Upon entering new credentials to a site that is not registered within this product, a pop-up window will appear prompting the user if they want to save this new password. This pop-up window will persist on any page the user enters within the browser until a decision is made. The code of the pop-up window can be read by remote servers and contains the login credentials and URL in cleartext. A malicious server could easily grab this information from the pop-up. This is related to id="uniqkey-password-popup" and password-popup/popup.html.
