There is a Factory Reset Protection (FRP) bypass security vulnerability in P20 Huawei smart phones versions before Emily-AL00A 9.0.0.167(C00E81R1P21T8). When re-configuring the mobile phone using the FRP function, an attacker can delete the activation lock after a series of operations. As a result, the FRP function is bypassed and the attacker gains access to the smartphone.
