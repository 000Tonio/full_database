# CVE-2019-6799

- Published: 2019-01-26T17:29:00

- Modified: 2020-08-24T17:37:00

An issue was discovered in phpMyAdmin before 4.8.5. When the AllowArbitraryServer configuration setting is set to true, with the use of a rogue MySQL server, an attacker can read any file on the server that the web server's user can access. This is related to the mysql.allow_local_infile PHP configuration, and the inadvertent ignoring of "options(MYSQLI_OPT_LOCAL_INFILE" calls.
