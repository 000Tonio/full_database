Dell EMC Unity and UnityVSA versions prior to 5.0.0.0.5.116 contain a plain-text password storage vulnerability. A Unisphere userâ€™s (including the admin privilege user) password is stored in a plain text in Unity Data Collection bundle (logs files for troubleshooting). A local authenticated attacker with access to the Data Collection bundle may use the exposed password to gain access with the privileges of the compromised user.

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
