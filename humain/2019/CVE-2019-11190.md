# CVE-2019-11190

- Published: 2019-04-12T00:29:00

- Modified: 2019-06-07T07:29:00

The Linux kernel before 4.8 allows local users to bypass ASLR on setuid programs (such as /bin/su) because install_exec_creds() is called too late in load_elf_binary() in fs/binfmt_elf.c, and thus the ptrace_may_access() check has a race condition when reading /proc/pid/stat.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
