# CVE-2019-9147

- Published: 2019-07-09T21:15:00

- Modified: 2020-08-24T17:37:00

Mailvelope prior to 3.1.0 is vulnerable to a clickjacking attack against the settings page. As the settings page is intended to be accessible from web applications, the browser's extension isolation mechanisms are disabled (web_accessible_resources). Mailvelope implements additional measures to prevent web applications from directly embedding the settings page, but this mechanism can be bypassed.
