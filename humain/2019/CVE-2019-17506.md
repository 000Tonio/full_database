There are some web interfaces without authentication requirements on D-Link DIR-868L B1-2.03 and DIR-817LW A1-1.04 routers. An attacker can get the router's username and password (and other information) via a DEVICE.ACCOUNT value for SERVICES in conjunction with AUTHORIZED_GROUP=1%0a to getcfg.php. This could be used to control the router remotely.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
