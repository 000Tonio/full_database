A vulnerability in the London Trust Media Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN Client v1.0 for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker to run arbitrary code with elevated privileges. The PIA client is vulnerable to a DLL injection vulnerability during the software update process. The updater loads several libraries from a folder that authenticated users have write access to. A low privileged user can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code as SYSTEM.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**
