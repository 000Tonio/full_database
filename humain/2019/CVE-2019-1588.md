A vulnerability in the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches running in Application-Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode could allow an authenticated, local attacker to read arbitrary files on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input and validation checking mechanisms of user-supplied input sent to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker unauthorized access to read arbitrary files on an affected device. This vulnerability has been fixed in version 14.0(1h).
