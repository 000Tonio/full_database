The ECDSA signature implementation in ecdsa.c in Arm Mbed Crypto 2.1 and Mbed TLS through 2.19.1 does not reduce the blinded scalar before computing the inverse, which allows a local attacker to recover the private key via side-channel attacks.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |
