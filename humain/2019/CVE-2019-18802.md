# CVE-2019-18802

- Published: 2019-12-13T13:15:00

An issue was discovered in Envoy 1.12.0. An untrusted remote client may send an HTTP header (such as Host) with whitespace after the header content. Envoy will treat "header-value " as a different string from "header-value" so for example with the Host header "example.com " one could bypass "example.com" matchers.
