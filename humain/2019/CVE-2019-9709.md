An issue was discovered in Mahara 17.10 before 17.10.8, 18.04 before 18.04.4, and 18.10 before 18.10.1. The collection title is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) due to not escaping it when viewing the collection's SmartEvidence overview page (if that feature is turned on). This can be exploited by any logged-in user.
