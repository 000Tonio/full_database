# CVE-2019-12795

- Published: 2019-06-11T22:29:00

- Modified: 2020-08-24T17:37:00

daemon/gvfsdaemon.c in gvfsd from GNOME gvfs before 1.38.3, 1.40.x before 1.40.2, and 1.41.x before 1.41.3 opened a private D-Bus server socket without configuring an authorization rule. A local attacker could connect to this server socket and issue D-Bus method calls. (Note that the server socket only accepts a single connection, so the attacker would have to discover the server and connect to the socket before its owner does.)

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
