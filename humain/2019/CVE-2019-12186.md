An issue was discovered in Sylius products. Missing input sanitization in sylius/sylius 1.0.x through 1.0.18, 1.1.x through 1.1.17, 1.2.x through 1.2.16, 1.3.x through 1.3.11, and 1.4.x through 1.4.3 and sylius/grid 1.0.x through 1.0.18, 1.1.x through 1.1.18, 1.2.x through 1.2.17, 1.3.x through 1.3.12, 1.4.x through 1.4.4, and 1.5.0 allows an attacker (an admin in the sylius/sylius case) to perform XSS by injecting malicious code into a field displayed in a grid with the "string" field type. The contents are an object, with malicious code returned by the __toString() method of that object.
