An incorrect access control exists in the Sony Photo Sharing Plus application in the firmware before PKG6.5629 version (for the X7500D TV and other applicable TVs). This vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files without authentication over HTTP when Photo Sharing Plus application is running. This may allow an attacker to browse a particular directory (e.g. images) inside the private network.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
