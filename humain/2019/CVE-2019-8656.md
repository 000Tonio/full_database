# CVE-2019-8656

- Published: 2020-10-27T20:15:00

- Modified: 2020-11-04T17:12:00

This was addressed with additional checks by Gatekeeper on files mounted through a network share. This issue is fixed in macOS Mojave 10.14.6, Security Update 2019-004 High Sierra, Security Update 2019-004 Sierra. Extracting a zip file containing a symbolic link to an endpoint in an NFS mount that is attacker controlled may bypass Gatekeeper.
