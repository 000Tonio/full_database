# CVE-2019-18210

Persistent XSS in /course/modedit.php of Moodle through 3.7.2 allows authenticated users (Teacher and above) to inject JavaScript into the session of another user (e.g., enrolled student or site administrator) via the introeditor[text] parameter. NOTE: the discoverer and vendor disagree on whether Moodle customers have a reasonable expectation that anyone authenticated as a Teacher can be trusted with the ability to add arbitrary JavaScript (this ability is not documented on Moodle's Teacher_role page). Because the vendor has this expectation, they have stated "this report has been closed as a false positive, and not a bug."

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
