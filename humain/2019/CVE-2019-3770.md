Dell Wyse Management Suite versions prior to 1.4.1 contain a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability when unregistering a device. A remote authenticated malicious user with low privileges could exploit this vulnerability to store malicious HTML or JavaScript code. When victim users access the submitted data through their browsers, the malicious code gets executed by the web browser in the context of the vulnerable application.
