3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH CODESYS V3 Library Manager, all versions prior to 3.5.16.0, allows the system to display active library content without checking its validity, which may allow the contents of manipulated libraries to be displayed or executed. The issue also exists for source libraries, but 3S-Smart Software Solutions GmbH strongly recommends distributing compiled libraries only.
