# CVE-2019-9111

- Published: 2019-02-25T04:29:00

- Modified: 2019-02-26T16:44:00

The msm gpu driver for custom Linux kernels on the Xiaomi perseus-p-oss MIX 3 device through 2018-11-26 has an integer overflow and OOPS because of missing checks of the count argument in sde_evtlog_filter_write in drivers/gpu/drm/msm/sde_dbg.c. This is exploitable for a device crash via a syscall by a crafted application on a rooted device.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
