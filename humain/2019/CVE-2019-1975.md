A vulnerability in the web-based interface of Cisco HyperFlex Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute a cross-frame scripting (XFS) attack on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient HTML iframe protection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directing a user to an attacker-controlled web page that contains a malicious HTML iframe. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct clickjacking or other clientside browser attacks.
