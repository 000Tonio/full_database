# CVE-2019-3882

- Published: 2019-04-24T16:29:00

- Modified: 2023-02-12T23:38:00

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's vfio interface implementation that permits violation of the user's locked memory limit. If a device is bound to a vfio driver, such as vfio-pci, and the local attacker is administratively granted ownership of the device, it may cause a system memory exhaustion and thus a denial of service (DoS). Versions 3.10, 4.14 and 4.18 are vulnerable.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
