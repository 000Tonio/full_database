In Octopus Tentacle versions 3.0.8 to 5.0.0, when a web request proxy is configured, an authenticated user (in certain limited OctopusPrintVariables circumstances) could trigger a deployment that writes the web request proxy password to the deployment log in cleartext. This is fixed in 5.0.1. The fix was back-ported to 4.0.7.
