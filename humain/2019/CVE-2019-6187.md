A stored CSV Injection vulnerability was reported in Lenovo XClarity Controller (XCC) that could allow an administrative or other appropriately permissioned user to store malformed data in certain XCC server informational fields, that could result in crafted formulas being stored in an exported CSV file. The crafted formula is not executed on XCC itself and has no effect on the server.

### CVSS Score: **4**
