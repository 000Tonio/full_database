/web/Lib/Action/IndexAction.class.php in D-Link Central WiFi Manager CWM(100) before v1.03R0100_BETA6 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a cookie because a cookie's username field allows eval injection, and an empty password bypasses authentication.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
