Dell EMC Data Protection Advisor versions 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 18.2 versions prior to patch 83, and 19.1 versions prior to patch 71 contain a server missing authorization vulnerability in the REST API. A remote authenticated malicious user with administrative privileges may potentially exploit this vulnerability to alter the applicationâ€™s allowable list of OS commands. This may lead to arbitrary OS command execution as the regular user runs the DPA service on the affected system.

### CVSS Score: **9**
