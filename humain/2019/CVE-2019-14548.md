An issue was discovered in EspoCRM before 5.6.9. Stored XSS in the body of an Article was executed when a victim opens articles received through mail. This Article can be formed by an attacker using the Knowledge Base feature in the tab list. The attacker could inject malicious JavaScript inside the body of the article, thus helping him steal victims' cookies (hence compromising their accounts).
