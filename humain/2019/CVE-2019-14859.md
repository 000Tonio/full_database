# CVE-2019-14859

- Published: 2020-01-02T15:15:00

- Modified: 2021-08-04T17:15:00

A flaw was found in all python-ecdsa versions before 0.13.3, where it did not correctly verify whether signatures used DER encoding. Without this verification, a malformed signature could be accepted, making the signature malleable. Without proper verification, an attacker could use a malleable signature to create false transactions.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**
