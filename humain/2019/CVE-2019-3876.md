A flaw was found in the /oauth/token/request custom endpoint of the OpenShift OAuth server allowing for XSS generation of CLI tokens due to missing X-Frame-Options and CSRF protections. If not otherwise prevented, a separate XSS vulnerability via JavaScript could further allow for the extraction of these tokens.
