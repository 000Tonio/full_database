It was found that OpenShift Container Platform versions 3.6.x - 4.6.0 does not perform SSH Host Key checking when using ssh key authentication during builds. An attacker, with the ability to redirect network traffic, could use this to alter the resulting build output.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
