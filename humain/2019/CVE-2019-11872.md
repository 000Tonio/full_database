The Hustle (aka wordpress-popup) plugin 6.0.7 for WordPress is vulnerable to CSV Injection as it allows for injecting malicious code into a pop-up window. Successful exploitation grants an attacker with a right to execute malicious code on the administrator's computer through Excel functions as the plugin does not sanitize the user's input and allows insertion of any text.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
