The D-Link DIR-816 A2 1.11 router only checks the random token when authorizing a goform request. An attacker can get this token from dir_login.asp and use an API URL /goform/form2userconfig.cgi to edit the system account without authentication.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
