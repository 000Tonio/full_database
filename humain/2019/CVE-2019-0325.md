SAP ERP HCM (SAP_HRCES) , version 3, does not perform necessary authorization checks for a report that reads payroll data of employees in a certain area. Due to this under certain conditions, the user that once had authorization to payroll data of an employee, which was later revoked, may retain access to the same data.
