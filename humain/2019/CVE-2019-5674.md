NVIDIA GeForce Experience before 3.18 contains a vulnerability when ShadowPlay or GameStream is enabled. When an attacker has access to the system and creates a hard link, the software does not check for hard link attacks. This behavior may lead to code execution, denial of service, or escalation of privileges.
