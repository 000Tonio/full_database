In the rcp client in MIT krb5-appl through 1.0.3, malicious servers could bypass intended access restrictions via the filename of . or an empty filename, similar to CVE-2018-20685 and CVE-2019-7282. The impact is modifying the permissions of the target directory on the client side. NOTE: MIT krb5-appl is not supported upstream but is shipped by a few Linux distributions. The affected code was removed from the supported MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) product many years ago, at version 1.8.
