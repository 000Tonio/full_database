# CVE-2019-16248

- Published: 2019-09-11T23:15:00

The "delete for" feature in Telegram before 5.11 on Android does not delete shared media files from the Telegram Images directory. In other words, there is a potentially misleading UI indication that a sender can remove a recipient's copy of a previously sent image (analogous to supported functionality in which a sender can remove a recipient's copy of a previously sent message).

### CVSS Score: **2.1**
