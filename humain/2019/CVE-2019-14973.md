# CVE-2019-14973

- Published: 2019-08-14T06:15:00

- Modified: 2020-11-06T01:15:00

_TIFFCheckMalloc and _TIFFCheckRealloc in tif_aux.c in LibTIFF through 4.0.10 mishandle Integer Overflow checks because they rely on compiler behavior that is undefined by the applicable C standards. This can, for example, lead to an application crash.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
