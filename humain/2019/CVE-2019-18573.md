The RSA Identity Governance and Lifecycle and RSA Via Lifecycle and Governance products prior to 7.1.1 P03 contain a Session Fixation vulnerability. An authenticated malicious local user could potentially exploit this vulnerability as the session token is exposed as part of the URL. A remote attacker can gain access to victimâ€™s session and perform arbitrary actions with privileges of the user within the compromised session.
