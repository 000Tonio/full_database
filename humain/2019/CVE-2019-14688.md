Trend Micro has repackaged installers for several Trend Micro products that were found to utilize a version of an install package that had a DLL hijack vulnerability that could be exploited during a new product installation. The vulnerability was found to ONLY be exploitable during an initial product installation by an authorized user. The attacker must convince the target to download malicious DLL locally which must be present when the installer is run.
