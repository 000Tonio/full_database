An information exposure and denial of service vulnerability exists in Jenkins Token Macro Plugin 2.5 and earlier in src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/tokenmacro/Parser.java, src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/tokenmacro/TokenMacro.java, src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/tokenmacro/impl/AbstractChangesSinceMacro.java, src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/tokenmacro/impl/ChangesSinceLastBuildMacro.java, src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/tokenmacro/impl/ProjectUrlMacro.java that allows attackers with the ability to control token macro input (such as SCM changelogs) to define recursive input that results in unexpected macro evaluation.
