# CVE-2019-10198

- Published: 2019-07-31T22:15:00

- Modified: 2020-09-30T18:16:00

An authentication bypass vulnerability was discovered in foreman-tasks before 0.15.7. Previously, commit tasks were searched through find_resource, which performed authorization checks. After the change to Foreman, an unauthenticated user can view the details of a task through the web UI or API, if they can discover or guess the UUID of the task.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
