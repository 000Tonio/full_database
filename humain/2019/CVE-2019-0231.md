# CVE-2019-0231

- Published: 2019-10-01T20:15:00

- Modified: 2019-10-08T17:47:00

Handling of the close_notify SSL/TLS message does not lead to a connection closure, leading the server to retain the socket opened and to have the client potentially receive clear text messages afterward. Mitigation: 2.0.20 users should migrate to 2.0.21, 2.1.0 users should migrate to 2.1.1. This issue affects: Apache MINA.
