- Modified: 2019-11-07T20:15:00

In Apak Wholesale Floorplanning Finance 6.31.8.3 and 6.31.8.5, an attacker can send an authenticated POST request with a malicious payload to /WFS/agreementView.faces allowing a stored XSS via the mainForm:loanNotesnotes:0:rich_text_editor_note_text parameter in the Notes section. Although versions 6.31.8.3 and 6.31.8.5 are confirmed to be affected, all versions with the vulnerable WYSIWYG editor in the Notes section are likely affected.
