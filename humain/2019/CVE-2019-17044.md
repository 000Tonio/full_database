An issue was discovered in BMC Patrol Agent 9.0.10i. Weak execution permissions on the PatrolAgent SUID binary could allow an attacker with "patrol" privileges to elevate his/her privileges to the ones of the "root" user by specially crafting a shared library .so file that will be loaded during execution.
