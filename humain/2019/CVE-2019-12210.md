# CVE-2019-12210

- Published: 2019-06-04T21:29:00

In Yubico pam-u2f 1.0.7, when configured with debug and a custom debug log file is set using debug_file, that file descriptor is not closed when a new process is spawned. This leads to the file descriptor being inherited into the child process; the child process can then read from and write to it. This can leak sensitive information and also, if written to, be used to fill the disk or plant misinformation.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
