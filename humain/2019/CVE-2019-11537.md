In osTicket before 1.12, XSS exists via /upload/file.php, /upload/scp/users.php?do=import-users, and /upload/scp/ajax.php/users/import if an agent manager user uploads a crafted .csv file to the User Importer, because file contents can appear in an error message. The XSS can lead to local file inclusion.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
