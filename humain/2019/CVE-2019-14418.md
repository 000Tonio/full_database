An issue was discovered in Veritas Resiliency Platform (VRP) before 3.4 HF1. When uploading an application bundle, a directory traversal vulnerability allows a VRP user with sufficient privileges to overwrite any file in the VRP virtual machine. A malicious VRP user could use this to replace existing files to take control of the VRP virtual machine.
