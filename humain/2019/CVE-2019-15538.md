# CVE-2019-15538

- Published: 2019-08-25T16:15:00

- Modified: 2021-06-02T15:22:00

An issue was discovered in xfs_setattr_nonsize in fs/xfs/xfs_iops.c in the Linux kernel through 5.2.9. XFS partially wedges when a chgrp fails on account of being out of disk quota. xfs_setattr_nonsize is failing to unlock the ILOCK after the xfs_qm_vop_chown_reserve call fails. This is primarily a local DoS attack vector, but it might result as well in remote DoS if the XFS filesystem is exported for instance via NFS.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
