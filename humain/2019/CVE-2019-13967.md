iTop 2.2.0 through 2.6.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application outage) via many requests to launch a compile operation. The requests use the pages/exec.php?exec_env=production&exec_module=itop-hub-connector&exec_page=ajax.php&operation=compile URI. This only affects the community version.
