An issue was discovered in the Readdle Documents app before 6.9.7 for iOS. The application's file-transfer web server allows for cross-origin requests from any domain, and the WebSocket server lacks authorization control. Any web site can execute JavaScript code (that accesses a user's data) via cross-origin requests.
