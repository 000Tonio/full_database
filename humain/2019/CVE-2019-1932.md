A vulnerability in Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Endpoints for Windows could allow an authenticated, local attacker with administrator privileges to execute arbitrary code. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of dynamically loaded modules. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a file in a specific location in the Windows filesystem. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute the code with the privileges of the AMP service.
