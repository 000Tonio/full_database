In Octopus Deploy before 2019.10.6, an authenticated user with TeamEdit permission could send a malformed Team API request that bypasses input validation and causes an application level denial of service condition. (The fix for this was also backported to LTS 2019.9.8 and LTS 2019.6.14.)

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
