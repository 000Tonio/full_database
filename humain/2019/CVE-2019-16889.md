Ubiquiti EdgeMAX devices before 2.0.3 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (disk consumption) because *.cache files in /var/run/beaker/container_file/ are created when providing a valid length payload of 249 characters or fewer to the beaker.session.id cookie in a GET header. The attacker can use a long series of unique session IDs.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**
