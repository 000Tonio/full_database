A stored, DOM based, cross-site scripting (XSS) flaw was found in Prometheus before version 2.7.1. An attacker could exploit this by convincing an authenticated user to visit a crafted URL on a Prometheus server, allowing for the execution and persistent storage of arbitrary scripts.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
