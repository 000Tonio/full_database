# CVE-2019-18840

In wolfSSL 4.1.0 through 4.2.0c, there are missing sanity checks of memory accesses in parsing ASN.1 certificate data while handshaking. Specifically, there is a one-byte heap-based buffer overflow inside the DecodedCert structure in GetName in wolfcrypt/src/asn.c because the domain name location index is mishandled. Because a pointer is overwritten, there is an invalid free.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
