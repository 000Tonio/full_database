An issue was discovered on XiongMai Besder IP20H1 V4.02.R12.00035520.12012.047500.00200 cameras. An attacker on the same local network as the camera can craft a message with a size field larger than 0x80000000 and send it to the camera, related to an integer overflow or use of a negative number. This then crashes the camera for about 120 seconds.
