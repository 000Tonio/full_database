The RSA Identity Governance and Lifecycle and RSA Via Lifecycle and Governance products prior to 7.1.1 P03 contain a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the My Access Live module [MAL]. An authenticated malicious local user could potentially exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted URL with scripts. When victim users access the module through their browsers, the malicious code gets injected and executed by the web browser in the context of the vulnerable web application.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
