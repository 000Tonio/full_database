# CVE-2019-20044

- Published: 2020-02-24T14:15:00

- Modified: 2023-01-09T16:41:00

In Zsh before 5.8, attackers able to execute commands can regain privileges dropped by the --no-PRIVILEGED option. Zsh fails to overwrite the saved uid, so the original privileges can be restored by executing MODULE_PATH=/dir/with/module zmodload with a module that calls setuid().

### CVSS Score: **7.2**
