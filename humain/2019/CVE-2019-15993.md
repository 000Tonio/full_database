A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Small Business Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive device information. The vulnerability exists because the software lacks proper authentication controls to information accessible from the web UI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTP request to the web UI of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access sensitive device information, which includes configuration files.
