Sourcecodester Restaurant Management System 1.0 allows an authenticated attacker to upload arbitrary files that can result in code execution. The issue occurs because the application fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input, e.g., "add a new food" allows .php files.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**
