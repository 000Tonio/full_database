- Published: 2019-08-27T05:15:00

- Modified: 2020-04-23T17:29:00

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.0.19. There is an out-of-bounds array access in __xfrm_policy_unlink, which will cause denial of service, because verify_newpolicy_info in net/xfrm/xfrm_user.c mishandles directory validation.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
