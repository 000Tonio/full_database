In the Quick Access Service (QAAdminAgent.exe) in Acer Quick Access V2.01.3000 through 2.01.3027 and V3.00.3000 through V3.00.3008, a REGULAR user can load an arbitrary unsigned DLL into the signed service's process, which is running as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. This is a DLL Hijacking vulnerability (including search order hijacking, which searches for the missing DLL in the PATH environment variable), which is caused by an uncontrolled search path element for nvapi.dll, atiadlxx.dll, or atiadlxy.dll.
