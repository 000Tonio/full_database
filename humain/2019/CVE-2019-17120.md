A stored and reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in WiKID 2FA Enterprise Server through 4.2.0-b2047 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via /WiKIDAdmin/adm_usrs.jsp. The usr parameter is vulnerable: the reflected cross-site scripting occurs immediately after the user is created. The malicious script is stored and will be executed whenever /WiKIDAdmin/adm_usrs.jsp is visited.
