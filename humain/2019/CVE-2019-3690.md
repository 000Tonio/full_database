# CVE-2019-3690

- Published: 2019-12-05T16:15:00

- Modified: 2020-11-20T16:15:00

The chkstat tool in the permissions package followed symlinks before commit a9e1d26cd49ef9ee0c2060c859321128a6dd4230 (please also check the additional hardenings after this fix). This allowed local attackers with control over a path that is traversed by chkstat to escalate privileges.
