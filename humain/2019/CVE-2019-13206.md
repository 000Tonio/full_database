Some Kyocera printers (such as the ECOSYS M5526cdw 2R7_2000.001.701) were affected by a buffer overflow vulnerability in multiple parameters of the Document Boxes functionality of the web application that would allow an authenticated attacker to perform a Denial of Service attack, crashing the device, or potentially execute arbitrary code on the device.
