A vulnerability in Cisco Webex Meetings Mobile (iOS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized read access to sensitive data by using an invalid Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate. The vulnerability is due to insufficient SSL certificate validation by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted SSL certificate to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks to decrypt confidential information on user connections to the affected software.
