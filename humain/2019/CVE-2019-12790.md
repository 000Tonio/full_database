# CVE-2019-12790

In radare2 through 3.5.1, there is a heap-based buffer over-read in the r_egg_lang_parsechar function of egg_lang.c. This allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact because of missing length validation in libr/egg/egg.c.
