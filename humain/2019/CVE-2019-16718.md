In radare2 before 3.9.0, a command injection vulnerability exists in bin_symbols() in libr/core/cbin.c. By using a crafted executable file, it's possible to execute arbitrary shell commands with the permissions of the victim. This vulnerability is due to an insufficient fix for CVE-2019-14745 and improper handling of symbol names embedded in executables.
