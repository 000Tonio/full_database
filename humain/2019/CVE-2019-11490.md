An issue was discovered in Npcap 0.992. Sending a malformed .pcap file with the loopback adapter using either pcap_sendqueue_queue() or pcap_sendqueue_transmit() results in kernel pool corruption. This could lead to arbitrary code executing inside the Windows kernel and allow escalation of privileges.
