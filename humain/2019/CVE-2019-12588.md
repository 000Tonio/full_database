The client 802.11 mac implementation in Espressif ESP8266_NONOS_SDK 2.2.0 through 3.1.0 does not validate correctly the RSN AuthKey suite list count in beacon frames, probe responses, and association responses, which allows attackers in radio range to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted message.

### CVSS Score: **3.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
