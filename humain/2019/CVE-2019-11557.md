The WebDorado Contact Form Builder plugin before 1.0.69 for WordPress allows CSRF via the wp-admin/admin-ajax.php action parameter, with resultant local file inclusion via directory traversal, because there can be a discrepancy between the $_POST['action'] value and the $_GET['action'] value, and the latter is unsanitized.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
