# CVE-2019-11340

- Published: 2019-04-19T14:29:00

util/emailutils.py in Matrix Sydent before 1.0.2 mishandles registration restrictions that are based on e-mail domain, if the allowed_local_3pids option is enabled. This occurs because of potentially unwanted behavior in Python, in which an email.utils.parseaddr call on user@bad.example.net@good.example.com returns the user@bad.example.net substring.
