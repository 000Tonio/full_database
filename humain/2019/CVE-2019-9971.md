PhoneSystem Terminal in 3CX Phone System (Debian based installation) 16.0.0.1570 allows an attacker to gain root privileges by using sudo with the tcpdump command, without a password. This occurs because the -z (aka postrotate-command) option to tcpdump can be unsafe when used in conjunction with sudo.

### CVSS Score: **9**
