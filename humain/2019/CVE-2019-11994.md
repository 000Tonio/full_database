A security vulnerability has been identified in HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen 9, HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen 10, HPE SimpliVity 380 Gen 10 G, HPE SimpliVity 2600 Gen 10, SimpliVity OmniCube, SimpliVity OmniStack for Cisco, SimpliVity OmniStack for Lenovo and SimpliVity OmniStack for Dell nodes. An API is used to execute a command manifest file during upgrade does not correctly prevent directory traversal and so can be used to execute manifest files in arbitrary locations on the node. The API does not require user authentication and is accessible over the management network, resulting in the potential for unauthenticated remote execution of manifest files. For all customers running HPE OmniStack version 3.7.9 and earlier. HPE recommends upgrading the OmniStack software to version 3.7.10 or later, which contains a permanent resolution. Customers and partners who can upgrade to 3.7.10 should upgrade at the earliest convenience. For all customers and partners unable to upgrade their environments to the recommended version 3.7.10, HPE has created a Temporary Workaround https://support.hpe.com/hpsc/doc/public/display?docLocale=en_US&docId=mmr_sf-EN_US000061901&withFrame for you to implement. All customer should upgrade to the recommended 3.7.10 or later version at the earliest convenience.
