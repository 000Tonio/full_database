In Avast Premium Security 19.8.2393, attackers can send a specially crafted request to the local web server run by Avast Antivirus on port 27275 to support Bank Mode functionality. A flaw in the processing of a command allows execution of arbitrary OS commands with the privileges of the currently logged in user. This allows for example attackers who compromised a browser extension to escape from the browser sandbox.
