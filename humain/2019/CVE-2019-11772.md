- Published: 2019-07-17T21:15:00

In Eclipse OpenJ9 prior to 0.15, the String.getBytes(int, int, byte[], int) method does not verify that the provided byte array is non-null nor that the provided index is in bounds when compiled by the JIT. This allows arbitrary writes to any 32-bit address or beyond the end of a byte array within Java code run under a SecurityManager.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
