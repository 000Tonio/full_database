A vulnerability in the firmware signature checking program of Cisco Integrated Management Controller (IMC) could allow an authenticated, local attacker to cause a buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient checking of an input buffer. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by passing a crafted file to the affected system. A successful exploit could inhibit an administrator's ability to access the system.
