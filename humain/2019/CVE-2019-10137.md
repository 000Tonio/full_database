A path traversal flaw was found in spacewalk-proxy, all versions through 2.9, in the way the proxy processes cached client tokens. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could use this flaw to test the existence of arbitrary files, if they have access to the proxy's filesystem, or can execute arbitrary code in the context of the httpd process.
