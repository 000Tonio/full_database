Genivia gSOAP 2.7.x and 2.8.x before 2.8.75 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application abort) or possibly have unspecified other impact if a server application is built with the -DWITH_COOKIES flag. This affects the C/C++ libgsoapck/libgsoapck++ and libgsoapssl/libgsoapssl++ libraries, as these are built with that flag.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
