HCL Traveler versions 9.x and earlier are susceptible to cross-site scripting attacks. On the Problem Report page of the Traveler servlet pages, there is a field to specify a file attachment to provide additional problem details. An invalid file name returns an error message that includes the entered file name. If the file name is not escaped in the returned error page, it could expose a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
