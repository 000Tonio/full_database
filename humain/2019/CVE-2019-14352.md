** DISPUTED ** In Joget Workflow 6.0.20, CSV Injection, also known as Formula Injection, exists, as demonstrated by jw/web/userview/crm_community/crm_userview_sales/_/account_new with the Account ID or Account Name field. NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of this finding because CSV is not the intended export format for spreadsheet applications.
