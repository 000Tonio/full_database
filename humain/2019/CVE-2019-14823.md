# CVE-2019-14823

- Published: 2019-10-14T20:15:00

- Modified: 2023-02-12T23:34:00

A flaw was found in the "Leaf and Chain" OCSP policy implementation in JSS' CryptoManager versions after 4.4.6, 4.5.3, 4.6.0, where it implicitly trusted the root certificate of a certificate chain. Applications using this policy may not properly verify the chain and could be vulnerable to attacks such as Man in the Middle.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
