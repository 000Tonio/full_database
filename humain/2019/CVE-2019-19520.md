- Published: 2019-12-05T00:15:00

- Modified: 2020-08-24T17:37:00

xlock in OpenBSD 6.6 allows local users to gain the privileges of the auth group by providing a LIBGL_DRIVERS_PATH environment variable, because xenocara/lib/mesa/src/loader/loader.c mishandles dlopen.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
