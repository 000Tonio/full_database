An issue was discovered in Interpeak IPWEBS on Green Hills INTEGRITY RTOS 5.0.4. It allocates 60 bytes for the HTTP Authentication header. However, when copying this header to parse, it does not check the size of the header, leading to a stack-based buffer overflow.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |
