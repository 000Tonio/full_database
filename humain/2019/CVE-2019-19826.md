The Views Dynamic Fields module through 7.x-1.0-alpha4 for Drupal makes insecure unserialize calls in handlers/views_handler_filter_dynamic_fields.inc, as demonstrated by PHP object injection, involving a field_names object and an Archive_Tar object, for file deletion. Code execution might also be possible.
