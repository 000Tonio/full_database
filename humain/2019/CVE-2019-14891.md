A flaw was found in cri-o, as a result of all pod-related processes being placed in the same memory cgroup. This can result in container management (conmon) processes being killed if a workload process triggers an out-of-memory (OOM) condition for the cgroup. An attacker could abuse this flaw to get host network access on an cri-o host.
