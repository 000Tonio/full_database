In pfSense 2.4.4-p2 and 2.4.4-p3, if it is possible to trick an authenticated administrator into clicking on a button on a phishing page, an attacker can leverage XSS to upload arbitrary executable code, via diag_command.php and rrd_fetch_json.php (timePeriod parameter), to a server. Then, the remote attacker can run any command with root privileges on that server.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
