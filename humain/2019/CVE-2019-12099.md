In PHP-Fusion 9.03.00, edit_profile.php allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code because includes/dynamics/includes/form_fileinput.php and includes/classes/PHPFusion/Installer/Lib/Core.settings.inc mishandle executable files during avatar upload.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
