XML Language Server (aka lsp4xml) before 0.9.1, as used in Red Hat XML Language Support (aka vscode-xml) before 0.9.1 for Visual Studio and other products, allows XXE via a crafted XML document, with resultant SSRF (as well as SMB connection initiation that can lead to NetNTLM challenge/response capture for password cracking). This occurs in extensions/contentmodel/participants/diagnostics/LSPXMLParserConfiguration.java.
