In Total Defense Anti-virus 9.0.0.773, resource acquisition from the untrusted search path C:\ used by caschelp.exe allows local attackers to hijack ccGUIFrm.dll, which leads to code execution. SYSTEM-level code execution can be achieved when the ccSchedulerSVC service runs the affected executable.
