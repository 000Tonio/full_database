In JetBrains Hub versions earlier than 2018.4.11298, the audit events for SMTPSettings show a cleartext password to the admin user. It is only relevant in cases where a password has not changed since 2017, and if the audit log still contains events from before that period.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
