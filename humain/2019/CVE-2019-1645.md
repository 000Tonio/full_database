A vulnerability in the Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to access sensitive data on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a lack of input and validation checking mechanisms for certain GET requests to API's on an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending HTTP GET requests to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to use this information to conduct additional reconnaissance attacks.
