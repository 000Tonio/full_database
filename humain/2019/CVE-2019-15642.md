# CVE-2019-15642

- Published: 2019-08-26T18:15:00

- Modified: 2019-09-04T18:09:00

rpc.cgi in Webmin through 1.920 allows authenticated Remote Code Execution via a crafted object name because unserialise_variable makes an eval call. NOTE: the Webmin_Servers_Index documentation states "RPC can be used to run any command or modify any file on a server, which is why access to it must not be granted to un-trusted Webmin users."

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
