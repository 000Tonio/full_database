# CVE-2019-9507

- Published: 2020-03-30T22:15:00

The web interface of the Vertiv Avocent UMG-4000 version 4.2.1.19 is vulnerable to command injection because the application incorrectly neutralizes code syntax before executing. Since all commands within the web application are executed as root, this could allow a remote attacker authenticated with an administrator account to execute arbitrary commands as root.

### CVSS Score: **9**
