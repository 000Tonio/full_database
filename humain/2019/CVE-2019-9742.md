gdwfpcd.sys in G Data Total Security before 2019-02-22 allows an attacker to bypass ACLs because Interpreted Device Characteristics lacks FILE_DEVICE_SECURE_OPEN and therefore files and directories "inside" the \\.\gdwfpcd device are not properly protected, leading to unintended impersonation or object creation.

### CVSS Score: **5**
