A CSV injection in arxes-tolina 3.0.0 allows malicious users to gain remote control of other computers. By entering formula code in the following columns: Kundennummer, Firma, Street, PLZ, Ort, Zahlziel, and Bemerkung, an attacker can create a user with a name that contains malicious code. Other users might download this data as a CSV file and corrupt their PC by opening it in a tool such as Microsoft Excel. The attacker could gain remote access to the user's PC.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
