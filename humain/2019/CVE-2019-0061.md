# CVE-2019-0061

- Published: 2019-10-09T20:15:00

The management daemon (MGD) is responsible for all configuration and management operations in Junos OS. The Junos CLI communicates with MGD over an internal unix-domain socket and is granted special permission to open this protected mode socket. Due to a misconfiguration of the internal socket, a local, authenticated user may be able to exploit this vulnerability to gain administrative privileges. This issue only affects Linux-based platforms. FreeBSD-based platforms are unaffected by this vulnerability. Exploitation of this vulnerability requires Junos shell access. This issue cannot be exploited from the Junos CLI. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D171, 15.1X49-D180; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D496, 15.1X53-D69; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R7-S4; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R2-S9; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R1-S8, 17.2R2-S7, 17.2R3-S1; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S4; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R1-S6, 17.4R1-S7, 17.4R2-S3, 17.4R3; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R2-S4, 18.1R3-S4; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R1-S5, 18.2R2-S2, 18.2R3; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R1-S3, 18.3R2; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S2, 18.4R2.
