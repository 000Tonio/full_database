A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges and execute administrative functions on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to an affected device as a low-privileged user and then sending specific HTTPS requests to execute administrative functions using the information retrieved during initial login.
