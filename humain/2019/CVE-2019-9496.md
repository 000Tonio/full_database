# CVE-2019-9496

- Published: 2019-04-17T14:29:00

- Modified: 2019-05-15T22:29:00

An invalid authentication sequence could result in the hostapd process terminating due to missing state validation steps when processing the SAE confirm message when in hostapd/AP mode. All version of hostapd with SAE support are vulnerable. An attacker may force the hostapd process to terminate, performing a denial of service attack. Both hostapd with SAE support and wpa_supplicant with SAE support prior to and including version 2.7 are affected.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
