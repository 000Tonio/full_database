An issue was discovered in CutePHP CuteNews 2.1.2. An attacker can infiltrate the server through the avatar upload process in the profile area via the avatar_file field to index.php?mod=main&opt=personal. There is no effective control of $imgsize in /core/modules/dashboard.php. The header content of a file can be changed and the control can be bypassed for code execution. (An attacker can use the GIF header for this.)
