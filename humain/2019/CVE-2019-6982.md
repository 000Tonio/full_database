An issue was discovered in Foxit 3D Plugin Beta before 9.4.0.16807 for Foxit Reader and PhantomPDF. The application could encounter an Out-of-Bounds Write and crash during the handling of certain PDF files that embed specifically crafted 3D content, because of the improper handling of a logic exception in the IFXASSERT function.
