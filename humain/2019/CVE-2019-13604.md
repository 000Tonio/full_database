There is a short key vulnerability in HID Global DigitalPersona (formerly Crossmatch) U.are.U 4500 Fingerprint Reader v24. The key for obfuscating the fingerprint image is vulnerable to brute-force attacks. This allows an attacker to recover the key and decrypt that image using the key. Successful exploitation causes a sensitive biometric information leak.
