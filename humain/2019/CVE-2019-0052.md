The srxpfe process may crash on SRX Series services gateways when the UTM module processes a specific fragmented HTTP packet. The packet is misinterpreted as a regular TCP packet which causes the processor to crash. This issue affects all SRX Series platforms that support URL-Filtering and have web-filtering enabled. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D85 on SRX Series; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D181, 15.1X49-D190 on SRX Series; 17.3 versions on SRX Series; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R1-S8, 17.4R2-S5, 17.4R3 on SRX Series; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S6 on SRX Series; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S1, 18.2R3 on SRX Series; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R1-S2, 18.3R2 on SRX Series; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S1, 18.4R2 on SRX Series.
