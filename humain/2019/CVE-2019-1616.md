The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of Cisco Fabric Services packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Cisco Fabric Services packet to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a buffer overflow, resulting in process crashes and a DoS condition on the device.
