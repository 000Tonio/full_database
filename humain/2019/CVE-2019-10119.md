eQ-3 HomeMatic CCU2 devices before 2.41.8 and CCU3 devices before 3.43.16 use session IDs for authentication but lack authorization checks. An attacker can obtain a session ID via an invalid login attempt to the RemoteApi account, aka HMCCU-154. This leads to automatic login as admin.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
