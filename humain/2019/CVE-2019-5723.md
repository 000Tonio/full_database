# CVE-2019-5723

- Published: 2019-03-21T16:01:00

- Modified: 2021-07-21T11:39:00

An issue was discovered in portier vision 4.4.4.2 and 4.4.4.6. Passwords are stored using reversible encryption rather than as a hash value, and the used Vigenere algorithm is badly outdated. Moreover, the encryption key is static and too short. Due to this, the passwords stored by the application can be easily decrypted.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
