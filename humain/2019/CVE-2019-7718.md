An issue was discovered in Metinfo 6.x. An attacker can leverage a race condition in the backend database backup function to execute arbitrary PHP code via admin/index.php?n=databack&c=index&a=dogetsql&tables=<?php and admin/databack/bakup_tables.php?2=file_put_contents URIs because app/system/databack/admin/index.class.php creates bakup_tables.php temporarily.
