# CVE-2019-15055

- Published: 2019-08-26T21:15:00

- Modified: 2020-10-06T12:15:00

MikroTik RouterOS through 6.44.5 and 6.45.x through 6.45.3 improperly handles the disk name, which allows authenticated users to delete arbitrary files. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to reset credential storage, which allows them access to the management interface as an administrator without authentication.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
