# CVE-2019-12802

- Published: 2019-06-13T21:29:00

- Modified: 2022-04-18T17:16:00

In radare2 through 3.5.1, the rcc_context function of libr/egg/egg_lang.c mishandles changing context. This allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact (invalid memory access in r_egg_lang_parsechar; invalid free in rcc_pusharg).
