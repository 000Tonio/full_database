MailEnable Enterprise Premium 10.23 was vulnerable to multiple directory traversal issues, with which authenticated users could add, remove, or potentially read files in arbitrary folders accessible by the IIS user. This could lead to reading other users' credentials including those of SYSADMIN accounts, reading other users' emails, or adding emails or files to other users' accounts.
