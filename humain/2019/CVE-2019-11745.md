When encrypting with a block cipher, if a call to NSC_EncryptUpdate was made with data smaller than the block size, a small out of bounds write could occur. This could have caused heap corruption and a potentially exploitable crash. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 68.3, Firefox ESR < 68.3, and Firefox < 71.
