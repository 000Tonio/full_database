# CVE-2019-25142

- Published: 2023-06-07T02:15:00

The Mesmerize & Materialis themes for WordPress are vulnerable to authenticated options change in versions up to, and including,1.6.89 (Mesmerize) and 1.0.172 (Materialis). This is due to 'companion_disable_popup' function only checking the nonce while sending user input to the 'update_option' function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to change otherwise restricted options.

### CVSS Score: **null**
