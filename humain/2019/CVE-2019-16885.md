In OkayCMS through 2.3.4, an unauthenticated attacker can achieve remote code execution by injecting a malicious PHP object via a crafted cookie. This could happen at two places: first in view/ProductsView.php using the cookie price_filter, and second in api/Comparison.php via the cookie comparison.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
