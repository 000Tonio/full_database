# CVE-2019-14846

- Published: 2019-10-08T19:15:00

- Modified: 2022-04-22T19:56:00

In Ansible, all Ansible Engine versions up to ansible-engine 2.8.5, ansible-engine 2.7.13, ansible-engine 2.6.19, were logging at the DEBUG level which lead to a disclosure of credentials if a plugin used a library that logged credentials at the DEBUG level. This flaw does not affect Ansible modules, as those are executed in a separate process.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
