An authorization bypass exists in Lenovo XClarity Controller (XCC) versions prior to 3.08 CDI340V, 3.01 TEI392O, 1.71 PSI328N where a valid authenticated user with lesser privileges may be granted read-only access to higher-privileged information if 1) “LDAP Authentication Only with Local Authorization” mode is configured and used by XCC, and 2) a lesser privileged user logs into XCC within 1 minute of a higher privileged user logging out. The authorization bypass does not exist when “Local Authentication and Authorization” or “LDAP Authentication and Authorization” modes are configured and used by XCC.
