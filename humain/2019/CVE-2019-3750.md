Dell Command Update versions prior to 3.1 contain an Arbitrary File Deletion Vulnerability. A local authenticated malicious user with low privileges potentially could exploit this vulnerability to delete arbitrary files by creating a symlink from the "Temp\IC\ICDebugLog.txt" to any targeted file. This issue occurs because of insecure handling of Temp directory permissions that were set incorrectly.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
