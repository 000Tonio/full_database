An internal product security audit of Lenovo XClarity Administrator (LXCA) discovered a Document Object Model (DOM) based cross-site scripting vulnerability in versions prior to 2.6.6 that could allow JavaScript code to be executed in the user's web browser if a specially crafted link is visited. The JavaScript code is executed on the user's system, not executed on LXCA itself.
