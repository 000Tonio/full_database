# CVE-2019-8362

DedeCMS through V5.7SP2 allows arbitrary file upload in dede/album_edit.php or dede/album_add.php, as demonstrated by a dede/album_edit.php?dopost=save&formzip=1 request with a ZIP archive that contains a file such as "1.jpg.php" (because input validation only checks that .jpg, .png, or .gif is present as a substring, and does not otherwise check the file name or content).

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
