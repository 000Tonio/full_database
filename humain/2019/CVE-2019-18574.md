RSA Authentication Manager software versions prior to 8.4 P8 contain a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Security Console. A malicious Security Console administrator could exploit this vulnerability to store arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code through the web interface which could then be included in a report. When other Security Console administrators open the affected report, the injected scripts could potentially be executed in their browser.
