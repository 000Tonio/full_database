Cloud Foundry Routing, all versions before 0.193.0, does not properly validate nonce input. A remote unauthenticated malicious user could forge an HTTP route service request using an invalid nonce that will cause the Gorouter to crash.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
