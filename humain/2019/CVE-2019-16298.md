An issue was discovered in Open Network Operating System (ONOS) 1.14. In the virtual broadband network gateway application (org.onosproject.virtualbng), the host event listener does not handle the following event types: HOST_MOVED, HOST_REMOVED, HOST_UPDATED. In combination with other applications, this could lead to the absence of intended code execution.
