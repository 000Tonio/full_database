Ene.sys in Asus Aura Sync through 1.07.71 does not properly validate input to IOCTL 0x80102044, 0x80102050, and 0x80102054, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or gain privileges via IOCTL requests using crafted kernel addresses that trigger memory corruption.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |
