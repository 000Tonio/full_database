# CVE-2019-12454

- Published: 2019-05-30T04:29:00

** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in wcd9335_codec_enable_dec in sound/soc/codecs/wcd9335.c in the Linux kernel through 5.1.5. It uses kstrndup instead of kmemdup_nul, which allows attackers to have an unspecified impact via unknown vectors. NOTE: The vendor disputes this issues as not being a vulnerability because switching to kmemdup_nul() would only fix a security issue if the source string wasn't NUL-terminated, which is not the case.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**
