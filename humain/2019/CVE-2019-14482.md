AdRem NetCrunch 10.6.0.4587 has a hardcoded SSL private key vulnerability in the NetCrunch web client. The same hardcoded SSL private key is used across different customers' installations when no other SSL certificate is installed, which allows remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging knowledge of this key from another installation.
