An issue was discovered in certain Oi third-party firmware that may be installed on Technicolor TD5130v2 devices. A Command Injection in the Ping module in the Web Interface in OI_Fw_V20 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands in the pingAddr parameter to mnt_ping.cgi. NOTE: This may overlap CVE-2017â€“14127.
