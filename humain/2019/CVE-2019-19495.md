The web interface on the Technicolor TC7230 STEB 01.25 is vulnerable to DNS rebinding, which allows a remote attacker to configure the cable modem via JavaScript in a victim's browser. The attacker can then configure the cable modem to port forward the modem's internal TELNET server, allowing external access to a root shell.
