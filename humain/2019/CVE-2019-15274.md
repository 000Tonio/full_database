A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco TelePresence Collaboration Endpoint (CE) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to perform command injections. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating as an administrative level user within the restricted shell and submitting malicious input to a specific command. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute previously staged code from the underlying filesystem.
