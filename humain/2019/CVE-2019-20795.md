# CVE-2019-20795

- Published: 2020-05-09T21:15:00

iproute2 before 5.1.0 has a use-after-free in get_netnsid_from_name in ip/ipnetns.c. NOTE: security relevance may be limited to certain uses of setuid that, although not a default, are sometimes a configuration option offered to end users. Even when setuid is used, other factors (such as C library configuration) may block exploitability.
