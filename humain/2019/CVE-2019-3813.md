Spice, versions 0.5.2 through 0.14.1, are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read due to an off-by-one error in memslot_get_virt. This may lead to a denial of service, or, in the worst case, code-execution by unauthenticated attackers.

### CVSS Score: **5.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
