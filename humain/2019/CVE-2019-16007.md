A vulnerability in the inter-service communication of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Android could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to perform a service hijack attack on an affected device or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to the use of implicit service invocations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to install a malicious application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access confidential user information or cause a DoS condition on the AnyConnect application.
