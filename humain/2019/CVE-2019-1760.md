A vulnerability in Performance Routing Version 3 (PfRv3) of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the affected device to reload. The vulnerability is due to the processing of malformed smart probe packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted smart probe packets at the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to reload the device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) attack on an affected system.
