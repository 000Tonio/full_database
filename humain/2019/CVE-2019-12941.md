# CVE-2019-12941

- Published: 2019-10-14T18:15:00

AutoPi Wi-Fi/NB and 4G/LTE devices before 2019-10-15 allows an attacker to perform a brute-force attack or dictionary attack to gain access to the WiFi network, which provides root access to the device. The default WiFi password and WiFi SSID are derived from the same hash function output (input is only 8 characters), which allows an attacker to deduce the WiFi password from the WiFi SSID.

### CVSS Score: **10**
