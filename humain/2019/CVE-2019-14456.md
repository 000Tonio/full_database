Opengear console server firmware releases prior to 4.5.0 have a stored XSS vulnerability related to serial port logging. If a malicious user of an external system (connected to a serial port on an Opengear console server) sends crafted text to a serial port (that has logging enabled), the text will be replayed when the logs are viewed. Exploiting this vulnerability requires access to the serial port and/or console server.
