# CVE-2019-17498

- Published: 2019-10-21T22:15:00

- Modified: 2022-10-27T21:08:00

In libssh2 v1.9.0 and earlier versions, the SSH_MSG_DISCONNECT logic in packet.c has an integer overflow in a bounds check, enabling an attacker to specify an arbitrary (out-of-bounds) offset for a subsequent memory read. A crafted SSH server may be able to disclose sensitive information or cause a denial of service condition on the client system when a user connects to the server.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
