A use-after-free flaw in the sandbox container implemented in cmdguard.sys in Comodo Antivirus 12.0.0.6870 can be triggered due to a race condition when handling IRP_MJ_CLEANUP requests in the minifilter for directory change notifications. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of service (BSOD) when an executable is run inside the container.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**
