# CVE-2019-15718

- Published: 2019-09-04T12:15:00

- Modified: 2022-02-20T06:15:00

In systemd 240, bus_open_system_watch_bind_with_description in shared/bus-util.c (as used by systemd-resolved to connect to the system D-Bus instance), calls sd_bus_set_trusted, which disables access controls for incoming D-Bus messages. An unprivileged user can exploit this by executing D-Bus methods that should be restricted to privileged users, in order to change the system's DNS resolver settings.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
