# CVE-2019-20059

- Published: 2020-02-10T13:15:00

- Modified: 2020-02-11T01:13:00

payment_manage.ajax.php and various *_manage.ajax.php in MFScripts YetiShare 3.5.2 through 4.5.4 directly insert values from the sSortDir_0 parameter into a SQL string. This allows an attacker to inject their own SQL and manipulate the query, typically extracting data from the database, aka SQL Injection. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-19732.
