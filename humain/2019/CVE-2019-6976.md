# CVE-2019-6976

- Published: 2019-01-26T23:29:00

- Modified: 2020-08-24T17:37:00

libvips before 8.7.4 generates output images from uninitialized memory locations when processing corrupted input image data because iofuncs/memory.c does not zero out allocated memory. This can result in leaking raw process memory contents through the output image.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
