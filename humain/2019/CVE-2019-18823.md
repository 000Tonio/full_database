HTCondor up to and including stable series 8.8.6 and development series 8.9.4 has Incorrect Access Control. It is possible to use a different authentication method to submit a job than the administrator has specified. If the administrator has configured the READ or WRITE methods to include CLAIMTOBE, then it is possible to impersonate another user to the condor_schedd. (For example to submit or remove jobs)
