The Last.fm desktop app (Last.fm Scrobbler) through 2.1.39 on macOS makes HTTP requests that include an API key without the use of SSL/TLS. Although there is an Enable SSL option, it is disabled by default, and cleartext requests are made as soon as the app starts.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
