# CVE-2019-17362

- Published: 2019-10-09T01:15:00

- Modified: 2019-11-09T19:15:00

In LibTomCrypt through 1.18.2, the der_decode_utf8_string function (in der_decode_utf8_string.c) does not properly detect certain invalid UTF-8 sequences. This allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and crash) or read information from other memory locations via carefully crafted DER-encoded data.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
