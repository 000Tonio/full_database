The kube-rbac-proxy container before version 0.4.1 as used in Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform does not honor TLS configurations, allowing for use of insecure ciphers and TLS 1.0. An attacker could target traffic sent over a TLS connection with a weak configuration and potentially break the encryption.
