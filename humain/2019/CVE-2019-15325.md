# CVE-2019-15325

- Published: 2019-08-22T20:15:00

- Modified: 2020-08-24T17:37:00

In GalliumOS 3.0, CONFIG_SECURITY_YAMA is disabled but /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf tries to set /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope to 1, which might increase risk because of the appearance that a protection mechanism is present when actually it is not.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
