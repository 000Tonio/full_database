Cybele Thinfinity VirtualUI 2.5.17.2 allows HTTP response splitting via the mimetype parameter within a PDF viewer request, as demonstrated by an example.pdf?mimetype= substring. The victim user must load an application request to view a PDF, containing the malicious payload. This results in a reflected XSS payload being executed.
