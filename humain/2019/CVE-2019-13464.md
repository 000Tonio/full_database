An issue was discovered in OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) 3.0.2. Use of X.Filename instead of X_Filename can bypass some PHP Script Uploads rules, because PHP automatically transforms dots into underscores in certain contexts where dots are invalid.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
