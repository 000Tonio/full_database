It was found that the Token Processing Service (TPS) did not properly sanitize the Token IDs from the "Activity" page, enabling a Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker could trick an authenticated victim into creating a specially crafted activity, which would execute arbitrary JavaScript code when viewed in a browser. All versions of pki-core are believed to be vulnerable.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
