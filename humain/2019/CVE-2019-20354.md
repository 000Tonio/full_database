The web application component of piSignage before 2.6.4 allows a remote attacker (authenticated as a low-privilege user) to download arbitrary files from the Raspberry Pi via api/settings/log?file=../ path traversal. In other words, this issue is in the player API for log download.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
