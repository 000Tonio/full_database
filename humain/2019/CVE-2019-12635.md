A vulnerability in the authorization module of Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain out-of-scope access to email. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not correctly implement role permission controls. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a custom role with specific permissions. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access the spam quarantine of other users.
