Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in TLM CMS 3.2 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via (1) the id parameter to news.php in a lirenews action, (2) the idnews parameter to goodies.php in a lire action, (3) the id parameter to file.php in a voir action, (4) the ID parameter to affichage.php, (5) the id_sal parameter to mod_forum/afficher.php, or (6) the id_sujet parameter to mod_forum/messages.php.  NOTE: it was later reported that goodies.php and affichage.php scripts are reachable through index.php, and 1.1 is also affected.  NOTE: it was later reported that the goodies.php vector also affects 3.1.
