# CVE-2007-5708

- Published: 2007-10-30T19:46:00

- Modified: 2011-03-07T05:00:00

slapo-pcache (overlays/pcache.c) in slapd in OpenLDAP before 2.3.39, when running as a proxy-caching server, allocates memory using a malloc variant instead of calloc, which prevents an array from being initialized properly and might allow attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via unknown vectors that prevent the array from being null terminated.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
