# CVE-2007-4888

- Published: 2007-09-14T00:17:00

- Modified: 2008-11-15T06:58:00

The "You are not allowed..." error handler in XWiki 1.0 B1 and 1.0 B2 associates the doc variable with the entire document content and metadata regardless of a user's view rights, which allows remote authenticated users to read arbitrary documents via a custom skin that prints the content attribute of the doc variable.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
