** DISPUTED **  Integer overflow in the process_envvars function in elf/rtld.c in glibc before 2.5-rc4 might allow local users to execute arbitrary code via a large LD_HWCAP_MASK environment variable value.  NOTE: the glibc maintainers state that they do not believe that this issue is exploitable for code execution.
