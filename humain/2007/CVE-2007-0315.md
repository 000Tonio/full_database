# CVE-2007-0315

- Published: 2007-01-18T00:28:00

- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:30:00

Multiple buffer overflows in FileZilla before 2.2.30a allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash) via unspecified vectors related to (1) Options.cpp when storing settings in the registry, and (2) the transfer queue (QueueCtrl.cpp).  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information. Failed exploit attempts may result in a application level denial-of-service condition.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**
