Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in the OpenWiki (formerly JD-Wiki) component (com_jd-wiki) 1.0.2, and possibly earlier, for Joomla! allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the mosConfig_absolute_path parameter to (1) dwpage.php or (2) wantedpages.php, different vectors than CVE-2006-4074.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information. The vendor has released JD-Wiki 1.0.3 to address these issues.
