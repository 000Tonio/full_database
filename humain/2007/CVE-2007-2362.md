# CVE-2007-2362

- Published: 2007-04-30T22:19:00

- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:31:00

Multiple buffer overflows in MyDNS 1.1.0 allow remote attackers to (1) cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a certain update, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow in update.c; and (2) cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via unspecified vectors that trigger an off-by-one stack-based buffer overflow in update.c. Successful exploitation requires update privileges and that "allow-update" is set to "yes" in mydns.conf.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
