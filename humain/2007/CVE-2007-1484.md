# CVE-2007-1484

- Published: 2007-03-16T21:19:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T18:18:00

The array_user_key_compare function in PHP 4.4.6 and earlier, and 5.x up to 5.2.1, makes erroneous calls to zval_dtor, which triggers memory corruption and allows local users to bypass safe_mode and execute arbitrary code via a certain unset operation after array_user_key_compare has been called.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
