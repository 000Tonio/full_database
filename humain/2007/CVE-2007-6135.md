# CVE-2007-6135

- Published: 2007-11-27T19:46:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:50:00

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in phpslideshow.php in PHPSlideShow 0.9.9.2, and possibly earlier, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the directory parameter. NOTE: this issue was originally reported for toonchapter8.php, but this is probably a site-specific name, since the PHPSlideShow distribution does not contain that file.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
