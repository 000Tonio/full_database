PHP 4.0.0 through 4.4.6 and 5.0.0 through 5.2.1 allows context-dependent attackers to read arbitrary memory locations via an interruption that triggers a user space error handler that changes a parameter to an arbitrary pointer, as demonstrated via the iptcembed function, which calls certain convert_to_* functions with its input parameters.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
