Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Google Desktop allows remote attackers to bypass protection schemes and inject arbitrary web script or HTML, and possibly gain full access to the system, by using an XSS vulnerability in google.com to extract the signature for the internal web server, then calling the "under" parameter in Advanced Search with the proper signature.

### CVSS Score: **7.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
