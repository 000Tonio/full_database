umount, when running with the Linux 2.6.15 kernel on Slackware Linux 10.2, allows local users to trigger a NULL dereference and application crash by invoking the program with a pathname for a USB pen drive that was mounted and then physically removed, which might allow the users to obtain sensitive information, including core file contents.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
