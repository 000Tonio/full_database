** DISPUTED **  Directory traversal vulnerability in data/inc/theme.php in Pluck 4.3, when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to read arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the file parameter.  NOTE: CVE and a reliable third party dispute this vulnerability because the code uses a fixed argument when invoking fputs, which cannot be used to read files.

### CVSS Score: **5**
