# CVE-2007-5894

- Published: 2007-12-06T02:46:00

- Modified: 2020-01-21T15:44:00

** DISPUTED **  The reply function in ftpd.c in the gssftp ftpd in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) does not initialize the length variable when auth_type has a certain value, which has unknown impact and remote authenticated attack vectors.  NOTE: the original disclosure misidentifies the conditions under which the uninitialized variable is used.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating " The 'length' variable is only uninitialized if 'auth_type' is neither the 'KERBEROS_V4' nor 'GSSAPI'; this condition cannot occur in the unmodified source code."

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
