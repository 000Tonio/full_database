# CVE-2007-0261

- Published: 2007-01-16T23:28:00

- Modified: 2017-10-19T01:29:00

snews.php in sNews 1.5.30 and earlier does not properly exit when authentication fails, which allows remote attackers to perform unauthorized administrative actions, as demonstrated by changing an administrative password via the changeup task, and by uploading PHP code via the imagefile parameter.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
