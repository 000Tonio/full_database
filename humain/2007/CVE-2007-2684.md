Jetbox CMS 2.1 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via (1) a direct request to (a) main_page.php, (b) open_tree.php, and (c) outputs.php; (2) a malformed view parameter to index.php, as demonstrated with an SQL injection manipulation; or (3) the id[] parameter to admin/cms/opentree.php, which reveals the installation path in the resulting error message.
