CA Anti-Virus for the Enterprise r8 and Threat Manager r8 before 20070510 use weak permissions (NULL security descriptor) for the Task Service shared file mapping, which allows local users to modify this mapping and gain privileges by triggering a stack-based buffer overflow in InoCore.dll before 8.0.448.0. The Computer Associates Integrated Threat Manager product is only vulnerable if it is release 8.0 before 2007-05-10.
