Cisco Secure ACS does not require authentication when Cisco Trust Agent (CTA) transmits posture information, which might allow remote attackers to gain network access via a spoofed Network Endpoint Assessment posture, aka "NACATTACK." NOTE: this attack might be limited to authenticated users and devices.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
