The readfile function in PHP 4.4.4, 5.1.6, and 5.2.1 allows context-dependent attackers to bypass safe_mode restrictions and read arbitrary files by referring to local files with a certain URL syntax instead of a pathname syntax, as demonstrated by a filename preceded a "php://../../" sequence.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | LOCAL |
