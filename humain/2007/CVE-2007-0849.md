scripts/cronscript.php in SysCP 1.2.15 and earlier does not properly quote pathnames in user home directories, which allows local users to gain privileges by placing shell metacharacters in a directory name, and then using the control panel to protect this directory, a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-2568.
