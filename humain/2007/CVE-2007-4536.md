# CVE-2007-4536

- Published: 2007-08-25T00:17:00

- Modified: 2009-02-05T06:29:00

TorrentTrader 1.07 and earlier sets insecure permissions for files in the root directory, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by modifying (1) disclaimer.txt, (2) sponsors.txt, and (3) banners.txt, which are used in an include call.  NOTE: there might be local attack vectors that extend to other files.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| --- | --- | --- |
