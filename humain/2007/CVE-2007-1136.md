# CVE-2007-1136

- Published: 2007-03-02T21:18:00

- Modified: 2011-03-08T02:51:00

index.php in WebMplayer before 0.6.1-Alpha allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via shell metacharacters in an exec function call.  NOTE: some sources have referred to this as eval injection in the param parameter, but CVE source inspection suggests that this is erroneous.
