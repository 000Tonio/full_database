- Published: 2007-04-10T22:19:00

- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:30:00

fsck, as used by the AirPort Disk feature of the AirPort Extreme Base Station with 802.11n before Firmware Update 7.1, and by Apple Mac OS X 10.3.9 through 10.4.9, does not properly enforce password protection of a USB hard drive, which allows context-dependent attackers to list arbitrary directories or execute arbitrary code, resulting from memory corruption.

### CVSS Score: **5.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
