Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in SerWeb 0.9.6 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the _SERWEB[serwebdir] parameter to (1) html/load_apu.php or (2) html/mail_prepend.php.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
