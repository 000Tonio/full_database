# CVE-2007-1717

- Published: 2007-03-28T00:19:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:25:00

The mail function in PHP 4.0.0 through 4.4.6 and 5.0.0 through 5.2.1 truncates e-mail messages at the first ASCIIZ ('\0') byte, which might allow context-dependent attackers to prevent intended information from being delivered in e-mail messages.  NOTE: this issue might be security-relevant in cases when the trailing contents of e-mail messages are important, such as logging information or if the message is expected to be well-formed.

### CVSS Score: **5**
