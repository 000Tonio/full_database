- Published: 2007-05-17T20:30:00

- Modified: 2018-11-29T15:46:00

The SIP channel module in Yet Another Telephony Engine (Yate) before 1.2.0 sets the caller_info_uri parameter using an incorrect variable that can be NULL, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL dereference and application crash) via a Call-Info header without a purpose parameter.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| --- | --- | --- |
