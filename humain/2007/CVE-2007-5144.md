Buffer overflow in the GDI engine in Windows Live Messenger, as used for Windows MSN Live 8.1, allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash or system crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code by placing a malformed file in a new folder under the Sharing Folders path, and triggering a synchronize operation through the Windows MSN Live online service, possibly related to extended file attributes and possibly related to an incomplete fix for MS07-046, as demonstrated by a (1) .jpg, (2) .gif, (3) .wmf, (4) .doc, or (5) .ico file.
