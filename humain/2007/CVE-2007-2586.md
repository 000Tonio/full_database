The FTP Server in Cisco IOS 11.3 through 12.4 does not properly check user authorization, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code, and have other impact including reading startup-config, as demonstrated by a crafted MKD command that involves access to a VTY device and overflows a buffer, aka bug ID CSCek55259.
