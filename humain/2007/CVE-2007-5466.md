Multiple buffer overflows in eXtremail 2.1.1 and earlier allow remote attackers to (1) have an unknown impact by sending multiple long strings to the IMAP port (143/tcp); (2) execute arbitrary code via a long string in an IMAP AUTHENTICATE PLAIN action, involving the ifParseAuthPlain function; (3) execute arbitrary code via a long LOGIN command to the admin interface port (4501/tcp); or (4) execute arbitrary code via a long string in an IMAP AUTHENTICATE LOGIN (aka CRAM-MD5 authentication) action, involving the ifProcImapAuth1 function.
