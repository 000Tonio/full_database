- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:32:00

archive_read_support_format_tar.c in libarchive before 2.2.4 allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via (1) an end-of-file condition within a tar header that follows a pax extension header or (2) a malformed pax extension header in an (a) PAX or a (b) TAR archive, which results in a NULL pointer dereference, a different issue than CVE-2007-3644. The vendor has released an update addressing this issue: http://people.freebsd.org/~kientzle/libarchive/
