Buffer overflow in the fcgi_env_add function in mod_proxy_backend_fastcgi.c in the mod_fastcgi extension in lighttpd before 1.4.18 allows remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary CGI variables and execute arbitrary code via an HTTP request with a long content length, as demonstrated by overwriting the SCRIPT_FILENAME variable, aka a "header overflow."
