The admin web console implemented by the Centrality Communications (aka Aredfox) PA168 chipset and firmware 1.54 and earlier, as provided by various IP phones, does not require passwords or authentication tokens when using HTTP, which allows remote attackers to connect to existing superuser sessions and obtain sensitive information (passwords and configuration data).

### CVSS Score: **9**
