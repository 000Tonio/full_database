# CVE-2007-0235

- Published: 2007-01-16T18:28:00

- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:31:00

Stack-based buffer overflow in the glibtop_get_proc_map_s function in libgtop before 2.14.6 (libgtop2) allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a process with a long filename that is mapped in its address space, which triggers the overflow in gnome-system-monitor.

### CVSS Score: **3.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
