Multiple buffer overflows in Live for Speed (LFS) demo, S1, and S2 allow remote authenticated users to (1) cause a denial of service (server crash) and probably execute arbitrary code via an ID 3 packet with a long nickname field, and (2) cause a denial of service (server crash) via an ID 10 packet containing a long string corresponding to an unavailable track.

### CVSS Score: **6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
