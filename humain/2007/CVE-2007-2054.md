- Published: 2007-04-30T22:19:00

Multiple format string vulnerabilities in AFFLIB before 2.2.6 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via certain command line parameters, which are used in (1) warn and (2) err calls in (a) lib/s3.cpp, (b) tools/afconvert.cpp, (c) tools/afcopy.cpp, (d) tools/afinfo.cpp, (e) aimage/aimage.cpp, (f) aimage/imager.cpp, and (g) tools/afxml.cpp.  NOTE: the aimage.cpp vector (e) has since been recalled from the researcher's original advisory, since the code is not called in any version of AFFLIB. The vendor has addressed this issue through the following product update: http://www.afflib.org/downloads/
