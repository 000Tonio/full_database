Unspecified vulnerability in the G/PGP (GPG) Plugin 2.0 for Squirrelmail 1.4.10a allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary commands via unspecified vectors, possibly related to the passphrase variable in the gpg_sign_attachment function, aka ZD-00000004.  this information is based upon a vague advisory by a vulnerability information sales organization that does not coordinate with vendors or release actionable advisories. A CVE has been assigned for tracking purposes, but duplicates with other CVEs are difficult to determine.
