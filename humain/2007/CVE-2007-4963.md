# CVE-2007-4963

- Published: 2007-09-18T22:17:00

Visual truncation vulnerability in WinImage 8.10 and earlier allows remote attackers to spoof a destination filename via a long sequence of space characters in a filename within a (1) .IMG or (2) .ISO file. NOTE: this can be leveraged with a separate directory traversal vulnerability to trick a careful user into overwriting arbitrary files.
