- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:31:00

nfnetlink_log in netfilter in the Linux kernel before 2.6.20.3 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via unspecified vectors involving the (1) nfulnl_recv_config function, (2) using "multiple packets per netlink message", and (3) bridged packets, which trigger a NULL pointer dereference.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
