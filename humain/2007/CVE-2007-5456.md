# CVE-2007-5456

- Published: 2007-10-14T18:17:00

- Modified: 2021-07-23T15:04:00

Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass the "File Download - Security Warning" dialog box and download arbitrary .exe files by placing a '?' (question mark) followed by a non-.exe filename after the .exe filename, as demonstrated by (1) .txt, (2) .cda, (3) .log, (4) .dif, (5) .sol, (6) .htt, (7) .itpc, (8) .itms, (9) .dvr-ms, (10) .dib, (11) .asf, (12) .tif, and unspecified other extensions, a different issue than CVE-2004-1331.  NOTE: this issue might not cross privilege boundaries, although it does bypass an intended protection mechanism.
