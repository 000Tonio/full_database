# CVE-2007-2461

- Published: 2007-05-02T22:19:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:25:00

The DHCP relay agent in Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) and PIX 7.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (dropped packets) via a DHCPREQUEST or DHCPINFORM message that causes multiple DHCPACK messages to be sent from DHCP servers to the agent, which consumes the memory allocated for a local buffer.  NOTE: this issue only occurs when multiple DHCP servers are used.
