# CVE-2007-5162

- Published: 2007-10-01T05:17:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:41:00

The connect method in lib/net/http.rb in the (1) Net::HTTP and (2) Net::HTTPS libraries in Ruby 1.8.5 and 1.8.6 does not verify that the commonName (CN) field in a server certificate matches the domain name in an HTTPS request, which makes it easier for remote attackers to intercept SSL transmissions via a man-in-the-middle attack or spoofed web site.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
