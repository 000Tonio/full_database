- Published: 2007-08-14T17:17:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:31:00

Linux kernel 2.4.35 and other versions allows local users to send arbitrary signals to a child process that is running at higher privileges by causing a setuid-root parent process to die, which delivers an attacker-controlled parent process death signal (PR_SET_PDEATHSIG).
