** REJECT **  Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in Cisco IOS 12.x and IOS XR allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, as demonstrated via the "Bind Shell", "Reverse Shell", and "Two byte rootshell (Tiny Shell)" attacks.  NOTE: the vendor and researcher agree that this issue does not cross privilege boundaries, saying they do not "represent a vulnerability."  The disclosure was intended to demonstrate techniques for exploitation, which is not covered by CVE.
