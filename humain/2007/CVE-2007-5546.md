# CVE-2007-5546

- Published: 2007-10-18T20:17:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:45:00

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in TIBCO SmartPGM FX allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (service stop and file-transfer outage) via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: as of 20071016, the only disclosure is a vague pre-advisory with no actionable information. However, since it is from a well-known researcher, it is being assigned a CVE identifier for tracking purposes.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**
