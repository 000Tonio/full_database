# CVE-2007-2240

- Published: 2007-08-15T19:17:00

- Modified: 2018-10-12T21:43:00

The IBM Lenovo Access Support acpRunner ActiveX control, as distributed in acpcontroller.dll before 1.2.8.0 and possibly acpir.dll before 1.0.0.9 (Automated Solutions 1.0 before fix pack 1), does not properly validate digital signatures of downloaded software, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof a download.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
