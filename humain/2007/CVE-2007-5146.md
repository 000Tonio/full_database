# CVE-2007-5146

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in dedi-group Der Dirigent 1.0 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the dedi_path parameter to (1) inc.generate_code.php, (2) fnc.type_forms.php, or (3) fnc.type.php in backend/inc/, or (4) frontend.php or (5) backend.php in projekt01/cms/inc/; or (6) the this_dir parameter to backend/inc/class.filemanager.php.  NOTE: vectors 4 and 5 are disputed by CVE because PHP encounters a fatal function-call error on a direct request for the file, before reaching the include statement.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
