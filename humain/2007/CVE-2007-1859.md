XScreenSaver 4.10, when using a remote directory service for credentials, does not properly handle the results from the getpwuid function in drivers/lock.c when there is no network connectivity, which causes XScreenSaver to crash and unlock the screen and allows local users to bypass authentication.

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |
