** DISPUTED **  Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Jelsoft vBulletin 3.6.5 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the (1) classfile parameter to includes/functions.php, the (2) nextitem parameter to includes/functions_cron.php, and the (3) specialtemplates parameter to includes/functions_forumdisplay.php. NOTE: this issue is disputed by a reliable third party who states "further investigation has revealed that the application is not vulnerable to this issue."  The original researcher also has a history of erroneous claims.
