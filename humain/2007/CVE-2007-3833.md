The AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) protocol handler in Cerulean Studios Trillian allows remote attackers to create files with arbitrary contents via certain aim: URIs, as demonstrated by a URI that begins with the "aim: &c:\" substring and contains a full pathname in the ini field.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for code execution by writing to a Startup folder.
