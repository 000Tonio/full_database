SQL injection vulnerability in www/people/editprofile.php in GForge 4.6b2 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the skill_delete[] parameter. An attacker may require credentials to exploit this. 

GForge's configuration setting $sys_use_people must be enabled.  This may not be the default setting contingent upon the environment in which it is installed.
