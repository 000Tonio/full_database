# CVE-2007-6599

- Published: 2008-01-04T02:46:00

- Modified: 2018-10-26T14:18:00

Race condition in fileserver in OpenAFS 1.3.50 through 1.4.5 and 1.5.0 through 1.5.27 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) by simultaneously acquiring and giving back file callbacks, which causes the handler for the GiveUpAllCallBacks RPC to perform linked-list operations without the host_glock lock.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
