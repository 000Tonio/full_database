# CVE-2007-6754

The ipalloc function in libc/stdlib/malloc.c in jemalloc in libc for FreeBSD 6.4 and NetBSD does not properly allocate memory, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to perform memory-related attacks such as buffer overflows via a large size value, related to "integer rounding and overflow" errors.

### CVSS Score: **5**
