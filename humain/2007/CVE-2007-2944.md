WabCMS 1.0 stores sensitive information under the web root with insufficient access control, which allows remote attackers to download a database via a direct request for db/wabcmsn.mdb.  NOTE: this issue was originally reported for "webCMS," but this was an error by an unreliable researcher.

### CVSS Score: **5**
