webserver.c in mt-dappd in Firefly Media Server 0.2.4 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL dereference and daemon crash) via a stats method action to /xml-rpc with (1) an empty Authorization header line, which triggers a crash in the ws_decodepassword function; or (2) a header line without a ':' character, which triggers a crash in the ws_getheaders function.
