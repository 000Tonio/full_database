CRLF injection vulnerability in WebCore in Apple Mac OS X 10.3.9, 10.4.9 and later, and iPhone before 1.0.1, allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers via LF characters in an XMLHttpRequest request, which are not filtered when serializing headers via the setRequestHeader function.  NOTE: this issue can be leveraged for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
