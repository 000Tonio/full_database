# CVE-2007-3731

- Published: 2007-09-17T17:17:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:18:00

The Linux kernel 2.6.20 and 2.6.21 does not properly handle an invalid LDT segment selector in %cs (the xcs field) during ptrace single-step operations, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL dereference and OOPS) via certain code that makes ptrace PTRACE_SETREGS and PTRACE_SINGLESTEP requests, related to the TRACE_IRQS_ON function, and possibly related to the arch_ptrace function.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
