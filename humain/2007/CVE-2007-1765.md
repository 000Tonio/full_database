Unspecified vulnerability in Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4 through Vista allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (persistent reboot) via a malformed ANI file, which results in memory corruption when processing cursors, animated cursors, and icons, a similar issue to CVE-2005-0416, as originally demonstrated using Internet Explorer 6 and 7.  NOTE: this issue might be a duplicate of CVE-2007-0038; if so, then use CVE-2007-0038 instead of this identifier.
