DiskManagementTool in the DiskManagement.framework 92.29 on Mac OS X 10.4.8 does not properly validate Bill of Materials (BOM) files, which allows attackers to gain privileges via a BOM file under /Library/Receipts/, which triggers arbitrary file permission changes upon execution of a diskutil permission repair operation.
