Unspecified vulnerability in Pidgin (formerly Gaim) 2.0.2 for Linux allows remote authenticated users, who are listed in a users list, to execute certain commands via unspecified vectors, aka ZD-00000035. NOTE: this information is based upon a vague advisory by a vulnerability information sales organization that does not coordinate with vendors or release actionable advisories. A CVE has been assigned for tracking purposes, but duplicates with other CVEs are difficult to determine.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
