# CVE-2007-5474

- Published: 2008-09-05T16:08:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:45:00

The driver for the Linksys WRT350N Wi-Fi access point with firmware 2.00.17 on the Atheros AR5416-AC1E chipset does not properly parse the Atheros vendor-specific information element in an association request, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (device reboot or hang) or possibly execute arbitrary code via an Atheros information element with an invalid length, as demonstrated by an element that is too long.

### CVSS Score: **6.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
