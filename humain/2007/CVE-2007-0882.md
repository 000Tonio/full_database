# CVE-2007-0882

- Published: 2007-02-12T20:28:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:25:00

Argument injection vulnerability in the telnet daemon (in.telnetd) in Solaris 10 and 11 (SunOS 5.10 and 5.11) misinterprets certain client "-f" sequences as valid requests for the login program to skip authentication, which allows remote attackers to log into certain accounts, as demonstrated by the bin account.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
