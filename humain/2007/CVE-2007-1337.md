The virtual machine process (VMX) in VMware Workstation before 5.5.4 does not properly read state information when moving from the ACPI sleep state to the run state, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (virtual machine reboot) via unknown vectors.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
