# CVE-2007-1218

- Published: 2007-03-02T21:18:00

- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:31:00

Off-by-one buffer overflow in the parse_elements function in the 802.11 printer code (print-802_11.c) for tcpdump 3.9.5 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted 802.11 frame.  NOTE: this was originally referred to as heap-based, but it might be stack-based.
