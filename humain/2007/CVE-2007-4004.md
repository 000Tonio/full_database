- Published: 2007-07-26T22:30:00

- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:32:00

Buffer overflow in the ftp client in IBM AIX 5.3 SP6 and 5.2.0 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors that trigger the overflow in a gets function call.  NOTE: the client is setuid root on AIX, so this issue crosses privilege boundaries.

### CVSS Score: **6.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
