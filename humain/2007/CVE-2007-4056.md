SQL injection vulnerability in directory.php in Prozilla Adult Directory allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the cat_id parameter in a list action. NOTE: the original report indicated that this was the "photo" SourceForge project (aka Maan Bsat Photo Collection), but that was incorrect.
