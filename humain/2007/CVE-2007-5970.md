MySQL 5.1.x before 5.1.23 and 6.0.x before 6.0.4 allows remote authenticated users to gain privileges on arbitrary tables via unspecified vectors involving use of table-level DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options when creating a partitioned table with the same name as a table on which the user lacks privileges.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
