WebCore on Apple Mac OS X 10.3.9 and 10.4.10, as used in Safari, does not properly parse HTML comments in TITLE elements, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and bypass some XSS protection schemes by embedding certain HTML tags within an HTML comment.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
