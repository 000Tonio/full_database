The fs_data_put_str function in ntfs.c in fls in Brian Carrier The Sleuth Kit (TSK) before 2.09 does not validate a certain length value, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and prevent examination of certain NTFS files via a malformed NTFS image, which triggers a buffer over-read.
