The CheckCustomerAccess function in functions.php in CRM-CTT Interleave before 4.2.0 (formerly CRM-CTT) does not properly verify user privileges, which allows remote authenticated users with the LIMITTOCUSTOMERS privilege to bypass intended access restrictions and edit non-active user settings.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.

| --- | --- | --- |
