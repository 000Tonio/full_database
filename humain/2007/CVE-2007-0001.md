# CVE-2007-0001

- Published: 2007-03-02T21:18:00

- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:31:00

The file watch implementation in the audit subsystem (auditctl -w) in the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4 kernel 2.6.9 allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel panic) by replacing a watched file, which does not cause the watch on the old inode to be dropped. Successful exploitation requires that the attacker previously created a watch for a file.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**
