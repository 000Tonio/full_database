- Published: 2007-04-12T19:19:00

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Pineapple Technologies Lore 1 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the (1) lang_path parameter to third_party/phpmailer/class.phpmailer.php or the (2) get_plugin_file_path parameter to third_party/smarty/libs/plugins/function.html_checkboxes.php.  NOTE: the affected files might be from other software packages, so this might not be a vulnerability in Lore itself.  NOTE: (1) might be the same issue as CVE-2006-5734.4.
