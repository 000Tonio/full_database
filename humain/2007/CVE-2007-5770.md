# CVE-2007-5770

- Published: 2007-11-14T01:46:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:29:00

The (1) Net::ftptls, (2) Net::telnets, (3) Net::imap, (4) Net::pop, and (5) Net::smtp libraries in Ruby 1.8.5 and 1.8.6 do not verify that the commonName (CN) field in a server certificate matches the domain name in a request sent over SSL, which makes it easier for remote attackers to intercept SSL transmissions via a man-in-the-middle attack or spoofed web site, different components than CVE-2007-5162.
