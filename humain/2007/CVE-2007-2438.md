# CVE-2007-2438

- Published: 2007-05-02T21:19:00

- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:43:00

The sandbox for vim allows dangerous functions such as (1) writefile, (2) feedkeys, and (3) system, which might allow user-assisted attackers to execute shell commands and write files via modelines. Successful exploitation requires that the "modelines" option is enabled and the user is tricked into opening a malicious file. The vendor has addressed this issue with the following patches:

VIM Development Group VIM 7.0-

VIM Development Group patch 7.0.234

VIM Development Group patch 7.0.235
ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/patches/7.0/7.0.235
