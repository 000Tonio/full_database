- Published: 2007-04-10T23:19:00

LIBSNDFILE.DLL, as used by AOL Nullsoft Winamp 5.33 and possibly other products, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted .MAT file that contains a value that is used as an offset, which triggers memory corruption. To exploit this issue, an attacker must entice an unsuspecting user to use the affected application to open a specially crafted file.
