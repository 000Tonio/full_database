# CVE-2007-1485

** DISPUTED **  Buffer overflow in the set_umask function in QFTP in LIBFtp 3.1-1 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a long -m argument. NOTE: CVE disputes this issue because QFTP is not setuid, and it is unlikely that there are web interfaces to QFTP that would accept untrusted command line arguments.
