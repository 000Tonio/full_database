# CVE-2007-2606

- Published: 2007-05-11T10:19:00

- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:44:00

Multiple buffer overflows in Firebird 2.1 allow attackers to trigger memory corruption and possibly have other unspecified impact via certain input processed by (1) config\ConfigFile.cpp or (2) msgs\check_msgs.epp.  NOTE: if ConfigFile.cpp reads a configuration file with restrictive permissions, then the ConfigFile.cpp vector may not cross privilege boundaries and perhaps should not be included in CVE.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
