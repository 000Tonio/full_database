- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:29:00

Multiple heap-based buffer overflows in WordPerfect Document importer/exporter (libwpd) before 0.8.9 allow user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted WordPerfect file in which values to loop counters are not properly handled in the (1) WP3TablesGroup::_readContents and (2) WP5DefinitionGroup_DefineTablesSubGroup::WP5DefinitionGroup_DefineTablesSubGroup functions.  NOTE: the integer overflow has been split into CVE-2007-1466. This vulnerability has been addressed by the vendor through a product update: http://sourceforge.net/projects/libwpd/
