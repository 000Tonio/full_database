# CVE-2007-3695

- Published: 2007-07-11T22:30:00

Buffer overflow in LICRCMD.EXE in CA ERwin Process Modeler (formerly AllFusion Process Modeler) 7.1 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long filename.  NOTE: the researcher does not suggest any circumstances in which the filename would come from an untrusted source, and therefore perhaps the issue does not cross privilege boundaries and should not be included in CVE.
