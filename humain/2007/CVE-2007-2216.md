# CVE-2007-2216

- Published: 2007-08-14T21:17:00

- Modified: 2021-07-23T15:04:00

The tblinf32.dll (aka vstlbinf.dll) ActiveX control for Internet Explorer 5.01, 6 SP1, and 7 uses an incorrect IObjectsafety implementation, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by requesting the HelpString property, involving a crafted DLL file argument to the TypeLibInfoFromFile function, which overwrites the HelpStringDll property to call the DLLGetDocumentation function in another DLL file, aka "ActiveX Object Vulnerability."
