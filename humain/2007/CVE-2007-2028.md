# CVE-2007-2028

- Published: 2007-04-13T18:19:00

- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:32:00

Memory leak in freeRADIUS 1.1.5 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large number of EAP-TTLS tunnel connections using malformed Diameter format attributes, which causes the authentication request to be rejected but does not reclaim VALUE_PAIR data structures.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
