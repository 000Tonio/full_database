The "Protect Worksheet" functionality in Mathsoft Mathcad 12 through 13.1, and PTC Mathcad 14, implements file access restrictions via a protection element in a gzipped XML file, which allows attackers to bypass these restrictions by removing this element. Mathsoft sold mathcad to PTC in 2006.  PTC now supports all vulnerable versions.
