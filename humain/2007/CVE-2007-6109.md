- Published: 2007-12-07T11:46:00

Stack-based buffer overflow in emacs allows user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly have unspecified other impact via a large precision value in an integer format string specifier to the format function, as demonstrated via a certain "emacs -batch -eval" command line.
