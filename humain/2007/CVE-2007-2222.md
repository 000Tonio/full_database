Multiple buffer overflows in the (1) ActiveListen (Xlisten.dll) and (2) ActiveVoice (Xvoice.dll) speech controls, as used by Microsoft Internet Explorer 5.01, 6, and 7, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted ActiveX object that triggers memory corruption, as demonstrated via the ModeName parameter to the FindEngine function in ACTIVEVOICEPROJECTLib.DirectSS.
