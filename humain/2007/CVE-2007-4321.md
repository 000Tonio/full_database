# CVE-2007-4321

- Published: 2007-08-14T00:17:00

- Modified: 2012-10-31T02:41:00

fail2ban 0.8 and earlier does not properly parse sshd log files, which allows remote attackers to add arbitrary hosts to the /etc/hosts.deny file and cause a denial of service by adding arbitrary IP addresses to the sshd log file, as demonstrated by logging in via ssh with a client protocol version identification containing an IP address string, a different vector than CVE-2006-6302.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
