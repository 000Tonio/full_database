Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in the Certificate Authority (CA) in IBM Lotus Domino before 7.0.3 allows local users, or attackers with physical access, to obtain sensitive information (passwords) when an administrator enters a "ca activate" or "ca unlock" command with any uppercase character, which bypasses a blacklist designed to suppress password logging, resulting in cleartext password disclosure in the console log and Admin panel.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |
