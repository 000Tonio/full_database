# CVE-2007-1583

- Published: 2007-03-21T23:19:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:25:00

The mb_parse_str function in PHP 4.0.0 through 4.4.6 and 5.0.0 through 5.2.1 sets the internal register_globals flag and does not disable it in certain cases when a script terminates, which allows remote attackers to invoke available PHP scripts with register_globals functionality that is not detectable by these scripts, as demonstrated by forcing a memory_limit violation.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
