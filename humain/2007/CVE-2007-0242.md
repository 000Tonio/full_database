# CVE-2007-0242

- Published: 2007-04-03T16:19:00

- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:31:00

The UTF-8 decoder in codecs/qutfcodec.cpp in Qt 3.3.8 and 4.2.3 does not reject long UTF-8 sequences as required by the standard, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) and directory traversal attacks via long sequences that decode to dangerous metacharacters.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
