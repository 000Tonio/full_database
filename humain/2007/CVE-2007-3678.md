Stack-based buffer overflow in the MSWord text-import extension (Word 6-2000 Filter.xnt) in QuarkXPress 7.2 for Windows, when using the Rectangle Text Box tool for importing text, allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long font name. Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code when a user imports text from a malicious MSWord document using e.g. the "Rectangle Text Box" tool.
