# CVE-2007-0025

- Published: 2007-02-13T20:28:00

- Modified: 2018-10-12T21:42:00

The MFC component in Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP2, and 2003 SP1 and Visual Studio .NET 2000, 2002 SP1, 2003, and 2003 SP1 allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an RTF file with a malformed OLE object that triggers memory corruption. NOTE: this might be due to a stack-based buffer overflow in the AfxOleSetEditMenu function in MFC42u.dll.
