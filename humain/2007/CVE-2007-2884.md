Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in Microsoft Visual Basic 6 allow user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) or execute arbitrary code via a Visual Basic Project (vbp) file with a long (1) Description or (2) Company Name (VersionCompanyName) field. Failed exploit attempts will likely cause a denial of service condition.
