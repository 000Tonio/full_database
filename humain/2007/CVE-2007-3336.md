Multiple "pointer overwrite" vulnerabilities in Ingres database server 2006 9.0.4, r3, 2.6, and 2.5, as used in multiple CA (formerly Computer Associates) products, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by sending certain TCP data at different times to the Ingres Communications Server Process (iigcc), which calls the (1) QUinsert or (2) QUremove functions with attacker-controlled input.
