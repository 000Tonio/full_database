# CVE-2007-4357

- Published: 2007-08-15T00:17:00

Mozilla Firefox 2.0.0.6 and earlier allows remote attackers to spoof the contents of the status bar via a link to a data: URI containing an encoded URL.  NOTE: the severity of this issue has been disputed by a reliable third party, since the intended functionality of the status bar allows it to be modified.

### CVSS Score: **5**
