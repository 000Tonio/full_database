Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) running PIX 7.0 before 7.0.7.1, 7.1 before 7.1.2.61, 7.2 before 7.2.2.34, and 8.0 before 8.0.2.11, when AAA is enabled, composes %ASA-5-111008 messages from the "test aaa" command with cleartext passwords and sends them over the network to a remote syslog server or places them in a local logging buffer, which allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information.
