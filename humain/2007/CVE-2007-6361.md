Gekko 0.8.2 and earlier stores sensitive information under the web root with possibly insufficient access control, which might allow remote attackers to read certain files under temp/, as demonstrated by a log file that records the titles of blog entries.  NOTE: access to temp/ is blocked by .htaccess in most deployments that use Apache HTTP Server.

### CVSS Score: **5**
