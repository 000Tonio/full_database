# CVE-2007-4311

- Published: 2007-08-13T21:17:00

- Modified: 2011-05-25T04:00:00

The xfer_secondary_pool function in drivers/char/random.c in the Linux kernel 2.4 before 2.4.35 performs reseed operations on only the first few bytes of a buffer, which might make it easier for attackers to predict the output of the random number generator, related to incorrect use of the sizeof operator.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
