# CVE-2007-4578

- Published: 2007-08-28T18:17:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:36:00

Sophos Anti-Virus for Windows and for Unix/Linux before 2.48.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted UPX packed file, resulting from an "integer cast around".  NOTE: as of 20070828, the vendor says this is a DoS and the researcher says this allows code execution, but the researcher is reliable.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
