eyeOS uses predictable checksum values in the checknum parameter for access control, which allows remote attackers to register many accounts via doCreateUser actions, add many eyeBoard messages via addMsg actions, and cause a denial of service or conduct certain unauthorized activities, by guessing valid parameter values.
