# CVE-2007-5227

- Published: 2007-10-05T23:17:00

- Modified: 2010-08-30T04:00:00

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in messaging/course/composeMessage.jsp in BlackBoard Learning System 6.3.1.593 and earlier in BlackBoard Academic Suite allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) subject_t and (2) body_text parameters.  NOTE: vector 2 requires bypassing a client-side security mechanism that attempts to block XSS sequences.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
