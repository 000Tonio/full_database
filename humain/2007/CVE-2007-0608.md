- Published: 2007-05-09T17:19:00

Advanced Guestbook 2.4.2 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via an invalid (1) GB_TBL parameter to (a) lang/codes-english.php or (b) image.php, which reveal the database name; (2) an invalid GB_DB parameter to index.php, coupled with a ../index lang cookie, which reveals the installation path; or (3) a direct request to index.php with no parameters or cookies, which reveals the installation path. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
