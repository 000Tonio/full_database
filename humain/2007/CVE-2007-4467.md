# CVE-2007-4467

- Published: 2007-08-31T00:17:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:35:00

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the Oracle JInitiator ActiveX control (beans.ocx) 1.1.8.16 and earlier, as used by Oracle Forms applications from Oracle and third parties, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified "initialization parameters." NOTE: it was later reported that 1.1.8.3 through 1.1.8.25, and probably 1.1.5.x and 1.1.7.x, are affected.
