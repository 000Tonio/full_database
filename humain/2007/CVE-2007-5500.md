# CVE-2007-5500

- Published: 2007-11-20T02:46:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:18:00

The wait_task_stopped function in the Linux kernel before 2.6.23.8 checks a TASK_TRACED bit instead of an exit_state value, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (machine crash) via unspecified vectors. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
