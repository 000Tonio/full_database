# CVE-2007-3305

- Published: 2007-06-21T01:30:00

- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:32:00

Heap-based buffer overflow in Cerulean Studios Trillian 3.x before 3.1.6.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a message sent through the MSN protocol, or possibly other protocols, with a crafted UTF-8 string, which triggers improper memory allocation for word wrapping when a window width is used as a buffer size, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-2478.
