Rule Set Based Access Control (RSBAC) before 1.3.5 does not properly use the Linux Kernel Crypto API for the Linux kernel 2.6.x, which allows context-dependent attackers to bypass authentication controls via unspecified vectors, possibly involving User Management password hashing and unchecked function return codes. http://www.frsirt.com/english/advisories/2007/2610 http://www.rsbac.org/download
