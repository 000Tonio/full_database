# CVE-2007-2052

- Published: 2007-04-16T22:19:00

- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:41:00

Off-by-one error in the PyLocale_strxfrm function in Modules/_localemodule.c for Python 2.4 and 2.5 causes an incorrect buffer size to be used for the strxfrm function, which allows context-dependent attackers to read portions of memory via unknown manipulations that trigger a buffer over-read due to missing null termination.
