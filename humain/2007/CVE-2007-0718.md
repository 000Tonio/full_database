Heap-based buffer overflow in Apple QuickTime before 7.1.5 allows remote user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a QTIF file with a Video Sample Description containing a Color table ID of 0, which triggers memory corruption when QuickTime assumes that a color table exists.
