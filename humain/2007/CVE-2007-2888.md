Stack-based buffer overflow in UltraISO 8.6.2.2011 and earlier allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long FILE string (filename) in a .cue file, a related issue to CVE-2007-2761.  NOTE: some details are obtained from third party information. Successful exploitation requires that the targeted user has the .BIN file in the same directory as the .CUE file.
