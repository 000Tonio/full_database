Integer overflow in the hrtimer_forward function (hrtimer.c) in Linux kernel 2.6.21-rc4, when running on 64-bit systems, allows local users to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a timer with a large expiry value, which causes the timer to always be expired.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
