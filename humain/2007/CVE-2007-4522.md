Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Ripe Website Manager 0.8.9 and earlier allow remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via one or more of the following vectors: the (1) id parameter to (a) pages/delete_page.php, (b) navigation/delete_menu.php, and (c) navigation/delete_item.php in admin/; the (2) menu_id, (3) name, (3) page_id, and (4) url parameters in (d) admin/navigation/do_new_item.php; the (5) new_menuname parameter in (e) admin/navigation/do_new_nav.php; and (6) area1, name, and url parameters to (f) admin/pages/do_new_page.php.  NOTE: some vectors might be reachable through the url and name parameters to (g) admin/navigation/new_nav_item.php.  NOTE: the original disclosure does not precisely state which vectors are associated with SQL injection versus XSS.
