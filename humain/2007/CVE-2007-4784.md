# CVE-2007-4784

- Published: 2007-09-10T21:17:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:38:00

The setlocale function in PHP before 5.2.4 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a long string in the locale parameter.  NOTE: this might not be a vulnerability in most web server environments that support multiple threads, unless this issue can be demonstrated for code execution.
