Multiple buffer overflows in php_iisfunc.dll in the iisfunc extension for PHP 5.2.0 and earlier allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code, probably during Unicode conversion, as demonstrated by a long string in the first argument to the iis_getservicestate function, related to the ServiceId argument to the (1) fnStartService, (2) fnGetServiceState, (3) fnStopService, and possibly other functions.
