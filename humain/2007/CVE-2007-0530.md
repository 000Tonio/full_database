** DISPUTED **  Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Advanced Guestbook 2.4.2 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the include_path parameter to (1) index.php, (2) addentry.php, or (3) picture.php, a different set of vectors than CVE-2006-5804.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by third party researchers, stating that the include_path variable is instantiated before use.
