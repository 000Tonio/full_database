# CVE-2007-6237

- Published: 2007-12-04T18:46:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:51:00

cp.php in DeluxeBB 1.09 does not verify that the membercookie parameter corresponds to the authenticated member during a profile update, which allows remote authenticated users to change the e-mail addresses of arbitrary accounts via a modified membercookie parameter, a different vector than CVE-2006-4078.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for administrative access by requesting password-reset e-mail through a lostpw action to misc.php.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
