# CVE-2007-1661

- Published: 2007-11-07T23:46:00

- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:39:00

Perl-Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library before 7.3 backtracks too far when matching certain input bytes against some regex patterns in non-UTF-8 mode, which allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service (crash), as demonstrated by the "\X?\d" and "\P{L}?\d" patterns.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | PARTIAL |
