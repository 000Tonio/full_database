# CVE-2007-5029

- Published: 2007-09-21T19:17:00

- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:33:00

Dibbler 0.6.0 does not verify that certain length parameters are appropriate for buffer sizes, which allows remote attackers to trigger a buffer over-read and cause a denial of service (daemon crash), as demonstrated by incorrect behavior of the TSrvMsg constructor in SrvMessages/SrvMsg.cpp when (1) reading the option code and option length and (2) parsing options.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
