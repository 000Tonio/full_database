- Published: 2010-10-19T20:00:00

- Modified: 2010-10-20T04:00:00

The ftp_STOU function in FTPServer.py in pyftpdlib before 0.2.0 does not limit the number of attempts to discover a unique filename, which might allow remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service via a STOU command.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
