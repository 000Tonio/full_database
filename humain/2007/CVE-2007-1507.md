The default configuration in OpenAFS 1.4.x before 1.4.4 and 1.5.x before 1.5.17 supports setuid programs within the local cell, which might allow attackers to gain privileges by spoofing a response to an AFS cache manager FetchStatus request, and setting setuid and root ownership for files in the cache.
