Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Free LAN In(tra|ter)net Portal (FLIP) before 1.0-RC3 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: some sources mention the escape_sqlData, implode_sql, and implode_sqlIn functions, but these are protection schemes, not the vulnerable functions.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
