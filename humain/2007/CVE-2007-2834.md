Integer overflow in the TIFF parser in OpenOffice.org (OOo) before 2.3; and Sun StarOffice 6, 7, and 8 Office Suite (StarSuite); allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a TIFF file with crafted values of unspecified length fields, which triggers allocation of an incorrect amount of memory, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow.
