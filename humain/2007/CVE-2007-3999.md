# CVE-2007-3999

- Published: 2007-09-05T10:17:00

- Modified: 2020-01-21T15:45:00

Stack-based buffer overflow in the svcauth_gss_validate function in lib/rpc/svc_auth_gss.c in the RPCSEC_GSS RPC library (librpcsecgss) in MIT Kerberos 5 (krb5) 1.4 through 1.6.2, as used by the Kerberos administration daemon (kadmind) and some third-party applications that use krb5, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and probably execute arbitrary code via a long string in an RPC message.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
