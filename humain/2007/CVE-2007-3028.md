# CVE-2007-3028

- Published: 2007-07-10T22:30:00

The LDAP service in Windows Active Directory in Microsoft Windows 2000 Server SP4 does not properly check "the number of convertible attributes", which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (service unavailability) via a crafted LDAP request, related to "client sent LDAP request logic," aka "Windows Active Directory Denial of Service Vulnerability".  NOTE: this is probably a different issue than CVE-2007-0040.
