# CVE-2007-1679

- Published: 2007-03-26T23:19:00

** DISPUTED **  Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Horde Groupware Webmail 1.0 allow remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors in (1) imp/search.php and (2) ingo/rule.php. NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor, noting that the search.php issue was resolved in CVE-2006-4255, and attackers can only use rule.php to inject XSS into their own pages.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
