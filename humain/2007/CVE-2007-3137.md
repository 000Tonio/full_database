- Published: 2007-06-08T16:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:47:00

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in 4print.asp in WmsCMS 2.0 and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) sbl, (2) sbr, or (3) search parameter. NOTE: the original disclosure claims the pageid parameter in index.php is affected, but this is incorrect.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| --- | --- | --- |
