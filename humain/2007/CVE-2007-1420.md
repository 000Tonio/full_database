- Published: 2007-03-12T23:19:00

MySQL 5.x before 5.0.36 allows local users to cause a denial of service (database crash) by performing information_schema table subselects and using ORDER BY to sort a single-row result, which prevents certain structure elements from being initialized and triggers a NULL dereference in the filesort function.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
