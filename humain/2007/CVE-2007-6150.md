The "internal state tracking" code for the random and urandom devices in FreeBSD 5.5, 6.1 through 6.3, and 7.0 beta 4 allows local users to obtain portions of previously-accessed random values, which could be leveraged to bypass protection mechanisms that rely on secrecy of those values.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |
