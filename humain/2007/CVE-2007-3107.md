The signal handling in the Linux kernel before 2.6.22, including 2.6.2, when running on PowerPC systems using HTX, allows local users to cause a denial of service via unspecified vectors involving floating point corruption and concurrency, related to clearing of MSR bits. This vulnerability affects Linux kernel 2.6.2 and later, when run on PowerPC systems using HTX.
