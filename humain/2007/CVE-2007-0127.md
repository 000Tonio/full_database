# CVE-2007-0127

- Published: 2007-01-09T02:28:00

- Modified: 2011-03-07T05:00:00

The Javascript SVG support in Opera before 9.10 does not properly validate object types in a createSVGTransformFromMatrix request, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via JavaScript code that uses an invalid object in this request that causes a controlled pointer to be referenced during the virtual function call.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**
