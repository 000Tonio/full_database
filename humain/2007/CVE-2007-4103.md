# CVE-2007-4103

- Published: 2007-07-31T10:17:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:33:00

The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) in Asterisk Open 1.2.x before 1.2.23, 1.4.x before 1.4.9, and Asterisk Appliance Developer Kit before 0.6.0, when configured to allow unauthenticated calls, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion) via a flood of calls that do not complete a 3-way handshake, which causes an ast_channel to be allocated but not released.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
