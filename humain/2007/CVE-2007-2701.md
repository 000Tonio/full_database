The JMS Message Bridge in BEA WebLogic Server 7.0 through SP7 and 8.1 through Service Pack 6, when configured without a username and password, or when the connection URL is not defined, allows remote attackers to bypass the security access policy and "send unauthorized messages to a protected queue." The vendor has released a product update to address this issue: ftp://anonymous:dev2dev%40bea.com@ftpna.bea.com/pub/releases/security/CR281022_81sp6_rarfiles.jar
