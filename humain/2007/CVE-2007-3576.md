** DISPUTED **  Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 executes web script from URIs of arbitrary scheme names ending with the "script" character sequence, using the (1) vbscript: handler for scheme names with 7 through 9 characters, and the (2) javascript: handler for scheme names with 10 or more characters, which might allow remote attackers to bypass certain XSS protection schemes.  NOTE: other researchers dispute the significance of this issue, stating "this only works when typed in the address bar."
