Multiple buffer overflows in Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) libFLAC before 1.2.1 allow user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via large (1) Metadata Block Size, (2) VORBIS Comment String Size, (3) Picture Metadata MIME-TYPE Size, (4) Picture Description Size, (5) Picture Data Length, (6) Padding Length, and (7) PICTURE Metadata width and height values in a .FLAC file, which result in a heap-based overflow; and large (8) VORBIS Comment String Size Length, (9) Picture MIME-Type, (10) Picture MIME-Type URL, and (11) Picture Description Length values in a .FLAC file, which result in a stack-based overflow.  NOTE: some of these issues may overlap CVE-2007-4619.
