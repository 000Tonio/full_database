# CVE-2007-1512

- Published: 2007-03-20T10:19:00

- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:38:00

Stack-based buffer overflow in the AfxOleSetEditMenu function in the MFC component in Microsoft Windows 2000 SP4, XP SP2, and Server 2003 Gold and SP1, and Visual Studio .NET 2002 Gold and SP1, and 2003 Gold and SP1 allows user-assisted remote attackers to have an unknown impact (probably crash) via an RTF file with a malformed OLE object, which results in writing two 0x00 characters past the end of szBuffer, aka the "MFC42u.dll Off-by-Two Overflow." NOTE: this issue is due to an incomplete patch (MS07-012) for CVE-2007-0025.
