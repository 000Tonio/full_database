# CVE-2007-0955

- Published: 2007-02-15T02:28:00

- Modified: 2019-10-02T20:13:00

The NTLM_UnPack_Type3 function in MENTLM.dll in MailEnable Professional 2.35 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via certain base64-encoded data following an AUTHENTICATE NTLM command to the imap port (143/tcp), which results in an out-of-bounds read.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
