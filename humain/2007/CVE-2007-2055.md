AFFLIB 2.2.8 and earlier allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters involving (1) certain command line parameters in tools/afconvert.cpp and (2) arguments to the get_parameter function in aimage/ident.cpp.  NOTE: it is unknown if the get_parameter vector (2) is ever called. The vendor has addressed this issue through a product update which can be found at: http://www.afflib.org/downloads/
