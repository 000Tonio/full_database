** DISPUTED **  The ipv6_getsockopt_sticky function in the kernel in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) Beta 5.1.0 allows local users to obtain sensitive information (kernel memory contents) via a negative value of the len parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed in a bug comment, stating that "len is ignored when copying header info to the user's buffer."
