Directory traversal vulnerability in include/common.php in bcoos 1.0.10 allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the xoopsOption[pagetype] parameter to the default URI for modules/news/.  NOTE: this can be leveraged by using legitimate product functionality to upload a file that contains the code, then including that file.
