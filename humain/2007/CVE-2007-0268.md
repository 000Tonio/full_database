Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Oracle Database 9.0.1.5, 9.2.0.7, and 10.1.0.5 have unknown impact and attack vectors related to (1) the Advanced Queuing component and sys.dbms_aqsys.dbms_aq privileges (DB01), (2) Advanced Replication and sys.dbms_repcat_untrusted (DB07), and (3) Oracle Text and ctxload (DB15).  NOTE: Oracle has not publicly claims by reliable researchers that DB01 is for SQL injection in the SYS.DBMS_AQ_INV package, and DB07 is for a buffer overflow in the UNREGISTER_SNAPSHOT procedure in the DBMS_REPCAT_UNTRUSTED package.
