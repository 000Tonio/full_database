- Published: 2007-04-10T21:19:00

- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:37:00

Use-after-free vulnerability in the Client/Server Run-time Subsystem (CSRSS) in Microsoft Windows Vista does not properly handle connection resources when starting and stopping processes, which allows local users to gain privileges by opening and closing multiple ApiPort connections, which leaves a "dangling pointer" to a process data structure.
