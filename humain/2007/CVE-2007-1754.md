# CVE-2007-1754

- Published: 2007-07-10T22:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:40:00

PUBCONV.DLL in Microsoft Office Publisher 2007 does not properly clear memory when transferring data from disk to memory, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a malformed .pub page via a certain negative value, which bypasses a sanitization procedure that initializes critical pointers to NULL, aka the "Publisher Invalid Memory Reference Vulnerability".
