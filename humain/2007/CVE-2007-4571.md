# CVE-2007-4571

- Published: 2007-09-26T10:17:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:18:00

The snd_mem_proc_read function in sound/core/memalloc.c in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) in the Linux kernel before 2.6.22.8 does not return the correct write size, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information (kernel memory contents) via a small count argument, as demonstrated by multiple reads of /proc/driver/snd-page-alloc.
