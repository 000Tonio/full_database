# CVE-2007-6591

KDE Konqueror 3.5.5 and 3.95.00, when a user accepts an SSL server certificate on the basis of the CN domain name in the DN field, regards the certificate as also accepted for all domain names in subjectAltName:dNSName fields, even though these fields cannot be examined in the product, which makes it easier for remote attackers to trick a user into accepting an invalid certificate for a spoofed web site.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
