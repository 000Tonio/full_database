The embedded LDAP server in BEA WebLogic Express and WebLogic Server 7.0 through SP6, 8.1 through SP5, 9.0, and 9.1, when in certain configurations, does not limit or audit failed authentication attempts, which allows remote attackers to more easily conduct brute-force attacks against the administrator password, or flood the server with login attempts and cause a denial of service.

### CVSS Score: **5.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
