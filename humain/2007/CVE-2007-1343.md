# CVE-2007-1343

- Published: 2007-03-08T22:19:00

- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:30:00

includes/functions.php in Craig Knudsen WebCalendar before 1.0.5 does not protect the noSet variable from external modification, which allows remote attackers to set arbitrary global variables via a URL with modified values in the noSet parameter, which leads to resultant vulnerabilities that probably include remote file inclusion and other issues.
