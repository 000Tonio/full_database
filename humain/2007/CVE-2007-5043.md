# CVE-2007-5043

- Published: 2007-09-24T00:17:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:40:00

Kaspersky Internet Security 7.0.0.125 does not properly validate certain parameters to System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) function handlers, which allows local users to (1) cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly gain privileges via the NtCreateSection kernel SSDT hook or (2) cause a denial of service (avp.exe service outage) via the NtLoadDriver kernel SSDT hook.  NOTE: this issue may partially overlap CVE-2006-3074.
