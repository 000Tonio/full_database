WebKit in Apple Safari 3 Beta before Update 3.0.3, and iPhone before 1.0.1, does not properly handle the interaction between International Domain Name (IDN) support and Unicode fonts, which allows remote attackers to create a URL containing "look-alike characters" (homographs) and possibly perform phishing attacks.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
