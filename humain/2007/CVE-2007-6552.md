Directory traversal vulnerability in index.php in AuraCMS 2.2 allows remote authenticated users to include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the act parameter, possibly involving the news pilih component; as demonstrated by including admin/admin_users.php to bypass a protection mechanism against direct request.
