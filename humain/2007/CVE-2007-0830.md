** DISPUTED **  Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Admin Control Panel (AdminCP) in Jelsoft vBulletin 3.6.4 allow remote authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified vectors related to the (1) User Group Manager, (2) User Rank Manager, (3) User Title Manager, (4) BB Code Manager, (5) Attachment Manager, (6) Calendar Manager, and (7) Forums & Moderators functions.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, stating that modifying HTML is an intended privilege of an administrator.  NOTE: it is possible that this issue overlaps CVE-2006-6040. Vendor has stated that remotely authenticated administrators were given the ability to inject arbitrary HTML/webscript code by design.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
