Asterisk Open Source 1.2.x before 1.2.26 and 1.4.x before 1.4.16, and Business Edition B.x.x before B.2.3.6 and C.x.x before C.1.0-beta8, when using database-based registrations ("realtime") and host-based authentication, does not check the IP address when the username is correct and there is no password, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication using a valid username.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
