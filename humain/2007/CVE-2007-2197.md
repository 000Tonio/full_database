# CVE-2007-2197

- Published: 2007-04-24T17:19:00

Race condition in the NeatUpload ASP.NET component 1.2.11 through 1.2.16, 1.1.18 through 1.1.23, and trunk.379 through trunk.445 allows remote attackers to obtain other clients' HTTP responses via multiple simultaneous requests, which triggers multiple calls to HttpWorkerRequest.FlushResponse for the same HttpWorkerRequest object and causes a buffer to be reused for a different request.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
