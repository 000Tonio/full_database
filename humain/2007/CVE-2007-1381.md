# CVE-2007-1381

- Published: 2007-03-10T00:19:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T21:20:00

The wddx_deserialize function in wddx.c 1.119.2.10.2.12 and 1.119.2.10.2.13 in PHP 5, as modified in CVS on 20070224 and fixed on 20070304, calls strlcpy where strlcat was intended and uses improper arguments, which allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a WDDX packet with a malformed overlap of a STRING element, which triggers a buffer overflow. This vulnerability impacts PHP CVS as of 2007-02-24
