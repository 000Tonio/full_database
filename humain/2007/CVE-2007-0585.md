# CVE-2007-0585

- Published: 2007-01-30T17:28:00

- Modified: 2018-08-13T21:47:00

include/debug.php in Webfwlog 0.92 and earlier, when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to obtain source code of files via the conffile parameter.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.  It is likely that this issue can be exploited to conduct directory traversal attacks. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
