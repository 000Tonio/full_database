QSslSocket in Trolltech Qt 4.3.0 through 4.3.2 does not properly verify SSL certificates, which might make it easier for remote attackers to trick a user into accepting an invalid server certificate for a spoofed service, or trick a service into accepting an invalid client certificate for a user.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
