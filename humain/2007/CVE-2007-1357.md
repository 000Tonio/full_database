# CVE-2007-1357

- Published: 2007-04-11T00:19:00

- Modified: 2011-03-08T02:51:00

The atalk_sum_skb function in AppleTalk for Linux kernel 2.6.x before 2.6.21, and possibly 2.4.x, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via an AppleTalk frame that is shorter than the specified length, which triggers a BUG_ON call when an attempt is made to perform a checksum.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
