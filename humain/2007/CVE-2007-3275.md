# CVE-2007-3275

- Published: 2007-06-19T21:30:00

- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:32:00

MailWasher Server before 2.2.1, when used with LDAP or Active Directory (AD), does not properly handle blank passwords, which allows remote attackers to access an arbitrary user account and read the spam e-mail messages stored for that account, possibly related to the LoginCheck::doPost function in mwi/servlet/Login.cpp.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information. Successful exploitation requires knowledge of a valid username and that MailWasher Server is integrated into an AD domain or LDAP repository.
