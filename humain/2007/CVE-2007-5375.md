Interpretation conflict in the Sun Java Virtual Machine (JVM) allows user-assisted remote attackers to conduct a multi-pin DNS rebinding attack and execute arbitrary JavaScript in an intranet context, when an intranet web server has an HTML document that references a "mayscript=true" Java applet through a local relative URI, which may be associated with different IP addresses by the browser and the JVM.
