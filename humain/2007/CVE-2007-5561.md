Format string vulnerability in the logging function in the Oracle OPMN daemon, as used on Oracle Enterprise Grid Console server 10.2.0.1, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the URI in an HTTP request to port 6003, aka Oracle reference number 6296175.  NOTE: this might be the same issue as CVE-2007-0282 or CVE-2007-0280, but there are insufficient details to be sure.
