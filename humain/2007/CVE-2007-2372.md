admin/send_mod.php in Gregory Kokanosky phpMyNewsletter 0.8 beta5 and earlier prints a Location header but does not exit when administrative credentials are missing, which allows remote attackers to compose an e-mail message via a post with the subject, message, format, and list_id fields; and send the message via a direct request for the MsgId value under admin/.
