Microsoft Windows Server 2003, when time restrictions are in effect for user accounts, generates different error messages for failed login attempts with a valid user name than for those with an invalid user name, which allows context-dependent attackers to determine valid Active Directory account names.

### CVSS Score: **1.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
