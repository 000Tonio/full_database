Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Oracle Database 10.1.0.5 and 10.2.0.3 allow remote authenticated users to have unknown impact via (1) DBMS_JAVA_TEST in the JavaVM component (DB01), (2) Oracle Text component (DB09), and (3) MDSYS.SDO_GEOR_INT in the Spatial component (DB15).  NOTE: a reliable researcher claims that DB01 is SQL injection in DBMS_PRVTAQIS.
