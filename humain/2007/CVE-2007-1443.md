Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in register.php in Woltlab Burning Board (wBB) 2.3.6 and Burning Board Lite 1.0.2pl3e allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) r_username, (2) r_email, (3) r_password, (4) r_confirmpassword, (5) r_homepage, (6) r_icq, (7) r_aim, (8) r_yim, (9) r_msn, (10) r_year, (11) r_month, (12) r_day, (13) r_gender, (14) r_signature, (15) r_usertext, (16) r_invisible, (17) r_usecookies, (18) r_admincanemail, (19) r_emailnotify, (20) r_notificationperpm, (21) r_receivepm, (22) r_emailonpm, (23) r_pmpopup, (24) r_showsignatures, (25) r_showavatars, (26) r_showimages, (27) r_daysprune, (28) r_umaxposts, (29) r_dateformat, (30) r_timeformat, (31) r_startweek, (32) r_timezoneoffset, (33) r_usewysiwyg, (34) r_styleid, (35) r_langid, (36) key_string, (37) key_number, (38) disablesmilies, (39) disablebbcode, (40) disableimages, (41) field[1], (42) field[2], and (43) field[3] parameters.  NOTE: a third-party researcher has disputed some of these vectors, stating that only the r_dateformat and r_timeformat parameters in Burning Board 2.3.6 are affected.
