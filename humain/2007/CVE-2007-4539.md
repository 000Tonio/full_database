- Published: 2007-08-27T21:17:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:35:00

The WebService (XML-RPC) interface in Bugzilla 2.23.3 through 3.0.0 does not enforce permissions for the time-tracking fields of bugs, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via certain XML-RPC requests, as demonstrated by the (1) Deadline and (2) Estimated Time fields.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
