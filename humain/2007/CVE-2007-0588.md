The InternalUnpackBits function in Apple QuickDraw, as used by Quicktime 7.1.3 and other applications on Mac OS X 10.4.8 and earlier, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PICT file that triggers memory corruption in the _GetSrcBits32ARGB function. NOTE: this issue might overlap CVE-2007-0462.
