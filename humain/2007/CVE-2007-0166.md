# CVE-2007-0166

- Published: 2007-01-11T20:28:00

- Modified: 2008-11-15T06:39:00

The jail rc.d script in FreeBSD 5.3 up to 6.2 does not verify pathnames when writing to /var/log/console.log during a jail start-up, or when file systems are mounted or unmounted, which allows local root users to overwrite arbitrary files, or mount/unmount files, outside of the jail via a symlink attack.

### CVSS Score: **6.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
