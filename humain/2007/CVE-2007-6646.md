Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in LiveCart 1.0.1, and possibly other versions before 1.1.0, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the return parameter to user/remindPassword, (2) the q parameter to the category script, (3) the return parameter to the order script, or (4) the email parameter to user/remindComplete.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
