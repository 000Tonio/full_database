** DISPUTED **  Directory traversal vulnerability in payments/ideal_process.php in the iDEAL transaction handler in ViArt Shopping Cart allows remote attackers to have an unknown impact via directory traversal sequences in the filename parameter to the createCertFingerprint function.  NOTE: this issue is disputed by CVE because PHP encounters a fatal function-call error on a direct request for payments/ideal_process.php.
