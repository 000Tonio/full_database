# CVE-2007-4157

- Published: 2007-08-03T21:17:00

PHPBlogger stores sensitive information under the web root with insufficient access control, which allows remote attackers to download a database containing an admin password hash via a direct request for data/pref.db.  NOTE: this can be easily leveraged for administrative access because composing the authentication cookie only requires the password hash, not the cleartext version.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
