Race condition in nss_ldap, when used in applications that are linked against the pthread library and fork after a call to nss_ldap, might send user data to the wrong process because of improper handling of the LDAP connection. NOTE: this issue was originally reported for Dovecot with the wrong mailboxes being returned, but other applications might also be affected.
