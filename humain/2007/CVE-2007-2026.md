# CVE-2007-2026

- Published: 2007-04-13T18:19:00

- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:41:00

The gnu regular expression code in file 4.20 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a crafted document with a large number of line feed characters, which is not well handled by OS/2 REXX regular expressions that use wildcards, as originally reported for AMaViS.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
