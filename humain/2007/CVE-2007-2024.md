Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in the UpLoad feature (lib/plugin/UpLoad.php) in PhpWiki 1.3.x allows remote attackers to upload arbitrary PHP files with a (1) php3, (2) php4, or (3) php5 extension. "Successful exploitation requires being logged in and that the webserver is configured to execute PHP scripts with such extensions. In the default configuration of PhpWiki, no registration or validation is necessary to log in."
