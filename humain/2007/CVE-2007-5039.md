Ghost Security Suite beta 1.110 does not properly validate certain parameters to System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) function handlers, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly gain privileges via the (1) NtCreateKey, (2) NtDeleteValueKey, (3) NtQueryValueKey, (4) NtSetSystemInformation, and (5) NtSetValueKey kernel SSDT hooks.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
