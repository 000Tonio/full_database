# CVE-2007-5795

- Published: 2007-11-02T22:46:00

- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:33:00

The hack-local-variables function in Emacs before 22.2, when enable-local-variables is set to :safe, does not properly search lists of unsafe or risky variables, which might allow user-assisted attackers to bypass intended restrictions and modify critical program variables via a file containing a Local variables declaration.

### CVSS Score: **6.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
