SQL injection vulnerability in news.php in webSPELL 4.01.02, when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the showonly parameter to index.php, a different vector than CVE-2006-5388. Successful exploitation e.g. allows retrieval of password hashes, but requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
