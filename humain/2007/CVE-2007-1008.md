# CVE-2007-1008

- Published: 2007-02-20T01:28:00

Apple iTunes 7.0.2 allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted XML list of radio stations, which results in memory corruption.  NOTE: iTunes retrieves the XML document from a static URL, which requires an attacker to perform DNS spoofing or man-in-the-middle attacks for exploitation. Successful exploitation requires that an attacker perform some type of DNS spoofing or man-in-the-middle attack prior to launching this attack.
