# CVE-2007-3280

- Published: 2007-06-19T21:30:00

The Database Link library (dblink) in PostgreSQL 8.1 implements functions via CREATE statements that map to arbitrary libraries based on the C programming language, which allows remote authenticated superusers to map and execute a function from any library, as demonstrated by using the system function in libc.so.6 to gain shell access.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |
