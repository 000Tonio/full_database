SSH Tectia Server for IBM z/OS before 5.4.0 uses insecure world-writable permissions for (1) the server pid file, which allows local users to cause arbitrary processes to be stopped, or (2) when _BPX_BATCH_UMASK is missing from the environment, creates HFS files with insecure permissions, which allows local users to read or modify these files and have other unknown impact.

### CVSS Score: **4.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |
