** DISPUTED **  Buffer overflow in the SMB_Connect_Server function in FreeRadius 1.1.3 and earlier allows attackers to execute arbitrary code related to the server desthost field of an SMB_Handle_Type instance.  NOTE: the impact of this issue has been disputed by a reliable third party and the vendor, who states that exploitation is limited "only to local administrators who have write access to the server configuration files."  CVE concurs with the dispute. -- Official Vendor Statement from the FreeRADIUS Server project

This issue is not a security vulnerability.  The exploit is available only to local administrators who have write access to the server configuration files.  As such, this issue has no security impact on any system running FreeRADIUS.
