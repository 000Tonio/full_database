# CVE-2007-5124

The embedded Internet Explorer server control in AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) 6.5.3.12 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified web script or HTML in an instant message, related to AIM's filtering of "specific tags and attributes" and the lack of Local Machine Zone lockdown.  NOTE: this issue reportedly exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2007-4901.
