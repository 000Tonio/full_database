# CVE-2007-0895

- Published: 2007-02-13T01:28:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:25:00

Race condition in recursive directory deletion with the (1) -r or (2) -R option in rm in Solaris 8 through 10 before 20070208 allows local users to delete files and directories as the user running rm by moving a low-level directory to a higher level as it is being deleted, which causes rm to chdir to a ".." directory that is higher than expected, possibly up to the root file system, a related issue to CVE-2002-0435.
