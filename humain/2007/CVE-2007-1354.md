The Access Control functionality (JMXOpsAccessControlFilter) in JMX Console in JBoss Application Server 4.0.2 and 4.0.5 before 20070416 uses a member variable to store the roles of the current user, which allows remote authenticated administrators to trigger a race condition and gain privileges by logging in during a session by a more privileged administrator, as demonstrated by privilege escalation from Read Mode to Write Mode.

### CVSS Score: **6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
