# CVE-2007-5059

- Published: 2007-09-24T22:17:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:40:00

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in GreenSQL allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via several vectors, as demonstrated by the (1) uname and (2) pass parameters in a login form, and (3) an unspecified "url value," leading to storage of XSS sequences in the database and display of these sequences in the alert section of the admin panel.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
