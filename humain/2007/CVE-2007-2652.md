Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Free-SA before 1.2.2 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors involving certain (1) sprintf and (2) vsprintf calls in (a) r_index.c, (b) r_reports.c, (c) r_topsites.c, (d) r_topuser.c, (e) r_typical.c, (f) r_userdatetime.c, and (g) r_users.c in reports/; and (h) w_fs.c, (i) w_internal.c, and (j) w_log_operations.c in work/, probably related to buffer overflows.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
