** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in data/inc/theme.php in Pluck 4.3, when register_globals is enabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the dir parameter.  NOTE: A reliable third party disputes this vulnerability because the applicable include is within a function that does not receive the dir parameter from an HTTP request.
