Kiwi CatTools before 3.2.0 beta uses weak encryption ("reversible encoding") for passwords, account names, and IP addresses in kiwidb-cattools.kdb, which might allow local users to gain sensitive information by decrypting the file.  NOTE: this issue could be leveraged with a directory traversal vulnerability for a remote attack vector.
