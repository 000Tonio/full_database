Directory traversal vulnerability in the Shared Folders feature for VMware Workstation before 5.5.4, when a folder is shared, allows users on the guest system to write to arbitrary files on the host system via the "Backdoor I/O Port" interface. Successful exploitation requires that a folder is shared.  Although the "Shared Folders" feature is enabled by default, no folders are shared by default.
