# CVE-2007-6273

- Published: 2007-12-07T11:46:00

- Modified: 2011-03-08T03:02:00

Multiple format string vulnerabilities in the configuration file in SonicWALL GLobal VPN Client 3.1.556 and 4.0.0.810 allow user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via format string specifiers in the (1) Hostname tag or the (2) name attribute in the Connection tag.  NOTE: there might not be any realistic circumstances in which this issue crosses privilege boundaries.
