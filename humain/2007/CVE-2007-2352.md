Multiple format string vulnerabilities in AFFLIB 2.2.6 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via certain command line parameters, which are used in (1) warn and (2) err calls, possibly involving (a) lib/s3.cpp, (b) tools/afconvert.cpp, (c) tools/afcopy.cpp, (d) tools/afinfo.cpp, (e) aimage/imager.cpp, and (f) tools/afxml.cpp.  NOTE: this identifier is intended to address the vectors that were not fixed in CVE-2007-2054, but the unfixed vectors were not explicitly listed. The vendor has addressed this issue with the following product update: http://www.afflib.org/downloads/
