# CVE-2007-5934

- Published: 2007-11-13T22:46:00

- Modified: 2011-03-08T03:01:00

The LOB functionality in PEAR MDB2 before 2.5.0a1 interprets a request to store a URL string as a request to retrieve and store the contents of the URL, which might allow remote attackers to use MDB2 as an indirect proxy or obtain sensitive information via a URL into a form field in an MDB2 application, as demonstrated by a file:// URL or a URL for an intranet web site.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
