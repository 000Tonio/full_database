# CVE-2007-2027

- Published: 2007-04-13T18:19:00

Untrusted search path vulnerability in the add_filename_to_string function in intl/gettext/loadmsgcat.c for Elinks 0.11.1 allows local users to cause Elinks to use an untrusted gettext message catalog (.po file) in a "../po" directory, which can be leveraged to conduct format string attacks. An untrusted message catalog might lead to a format-string attack when an
attacker tricks user into launching links from a particular directory.
