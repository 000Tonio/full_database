Nortel Networks CallPilot and Meridian Mail voicemail systems, when a mailbox has auto logon enabled, allow remote attackers to retrieve or remove messages, or reconfigure the mailbox, by spoofing Calling Number Identification (CNID, aka Caller ID). Access complexity set to Medium because Nortel Networks voicemail systems do not hard code or default to this behavior.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**
