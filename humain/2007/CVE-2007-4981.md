# CVE-2007-4981

- Published: 2007-09-19T18:17:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:39:00

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the save function in Obedit 3.03 allows user-assisted remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unknown vectors, as demonstrated by a SCRIPT element in an unspecified context when saving a document.  NOTE: because the details of the attack are uncertain, it is unclear whether this crosses privilege boundaries.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
