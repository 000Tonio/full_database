Stack-based buffer overflow in the Line Printer Daemon (LPD) in Cisco IOS before 12.2(18)SXF11, 12.4(16a), and 12.4(2)T6 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by setting a long hostname on the target system, then causing an error message to be printed, as demonstrated by a telnet session to the LPD from a source port other than 515.
