# CVE-2007-0543

- Published: 2007-01-29T17:28:00

ZixForum 1.14 and earlier stores sensitive information under the web root with insufficient access control, which allows remote attackers to download a database containing passwords via a direct request for Zixforum.mdb.  NOTE: a followup post suggests that this issue only occurs if the administrator does not properly follow installation directions.
