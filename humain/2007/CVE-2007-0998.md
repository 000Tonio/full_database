The VNC server implementation in QEMU, as used by Xen and possibly other environments, allows local users of a guest operating system to read arbitrary files on the host operating system via unspecified vectors related to QEMU monitor mode, as demonstrated by mapping files to a CDROM device.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
