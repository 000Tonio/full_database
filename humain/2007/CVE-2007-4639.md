# CVE-2007-4639

- Published: 2007-08-31T23:17:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:36:00

EnterpriseDB Advanced Server 8.2 does not properly handle certain debugging function calls that occur before a call to pldbg_create_listener, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a SELECT statement that invokes a pldbg_ function, as demonstrated by (1) pldbg_get_stack and (2) pldbg_abort_target, which triggers use of an uninitialized pointer.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |
