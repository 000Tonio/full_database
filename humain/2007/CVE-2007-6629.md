Interpretation conflict in LScube Feng 0.1.15 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL dereference and daemon crash) via a User-Agent header line that contains a carriage-return character, which is considered a line delimiter when the header is split into individual lines, but not when log_user_agent in RTSP_utils.c parses the content of the User-Agent line.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
