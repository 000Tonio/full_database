Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in fsplib.c in fsplib before 0.9 might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a long filename that is not properly handled by the fsp_readdir_native function when MAXNAMLEN is greater than 255, or (2) a long d_name directory (dirent) field in the fsp_readdir function.
