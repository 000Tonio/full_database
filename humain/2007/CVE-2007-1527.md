# CVE-2007-1527

- Published: 2007-03-20T20:19:00

- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:38:00

The LLTD Mapper in Microsoft Windows Vista does not verify that an IP address in a TLV type 0x07 field in a HELLO packet corresponds to a valid IP address for the local network, which allows remote attackers to trick users into communicating with an external host by sending a HELLO packet with the MW characteristic and a spoofed TLV type 0x07 field, aka the "Spoof and Management URL IP Redirect" attack.

### CVSS Score: **5**
