The web interface in Fujitsu-Siemens Computers PRIMERGY BX300 Switch Blade allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by canceling the authentication dialog when accessing a sub-page, which still displays the form field contents of the sub-page, as demonstrated using (1) config/ip_management.htm and (2) config/snmp_config.htm.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
