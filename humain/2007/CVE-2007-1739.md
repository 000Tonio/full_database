Heap-based buffer overflow in the LDAP server in IBM Lotus Domino before 6.5.6 and 7.x before 7.0.2 FP1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a long, malformed DN request, which causes only the lower 16 bits of the string length to be used in memory allocation.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
