PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in the Seitenschutz plugin for OPENi-CMS 1.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the (1) config[oi_dir] and possibly (2) config[openi_dir] parameters to open-admin/plugins/site_protection/index.php.  NOTE: vector 2 might be the same as CVE-2006-4750. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
