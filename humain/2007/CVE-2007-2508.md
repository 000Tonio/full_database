# CVE-2007-2508

- Published: 2007-05-08T23:19:00

- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:44:00

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in Trend Micro ServerProtect 5.58 before Security Patch 2 Build 1174 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via crafted data to (1) TCP port 5168, which triggers an overflow in the CAgRpcClient::CreateBinding function in the AgRpcCln.dll library in SpntSvc.exe; or (2) TCP port 3628, which triggers an overflow in EarthAgent.exe.  NOTE: both issues are reachable via TmRpcSrv.dll.
