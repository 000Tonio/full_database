# CVE-2007-0854

- Published: 2007-02-08T18:28:00

Remote file inclusion vulnerability in scripts2/objcache in cPanel WebHost Manager (WHM) allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a URL in the obj parameter.  NOTE: a third party claims that this issue is not file inclusion because the contents are not parsed, but the attack can be used to overwrite files in /var/cpanel/objcache or provide unexpected web page contents.
