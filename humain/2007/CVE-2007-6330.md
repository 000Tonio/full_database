# CVE-2007-6330

- Published: 2007-12-13T19:46:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:52:00

Meridian Prolog Manager 2007, and 7.5 and earlier, sends all usernames and passwords to the client in a (1) cleartext or (2) weakly encrypted format to support client-side login authentication, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain database access by capturing credentials via a man-in-the-middle attack.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
