The get_filter_list function in IBM Tivoli Directory Server (TDS) 5.2 before 5.2.0.5-TIV-ITDS-LA0006 does not properly perform certain sub filter parsing, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a malformed search filter.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
