# CVE-2007-4036

- Published: 2007-07-27T22:30:00

** DISPUTED **  Guidance Software EnCase allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service via (1) a corrupted Microsoft Exchange database, which triggers an application crash when many options are selected; (2) a corrupted NTFS filesystem, which causes the application to report "memory allocation errors;" or (3) deeply nested directories, which trigger an application crash during an Expand All action. NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of these vectors because the user can select fewer options, there is no operational impact, or the user can do less expansion.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
