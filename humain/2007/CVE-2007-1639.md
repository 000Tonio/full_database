# CVE-2007-1639

- Published: 2007-03-23T23:19:00

- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:39:00

Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in PHProjekt 5.2.0, when magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allows remote authenticated users to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code via a file with an executable extension, which is then accessed by the (1) calendar or (2) file management module, or possibly unspecified other files. Successful exploitation requires that variable "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled. Upgrade to version 5.2.1.
