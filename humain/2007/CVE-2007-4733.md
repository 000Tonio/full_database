The Aztech DSL600EU router, when WAN access to the web interface is disabled, does not properly block inbound traffic on TCP port 80, which allows remote attackers to connect to the web interface by guessing a TCP sequence number, possibly involving spoofing of an ARP packet, a related issue to CVE-1999-0077.
