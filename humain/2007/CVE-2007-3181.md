Buffer overflow in fbserver.exe in Firebird SQL 2 before 2.0.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a large p_cnct_count value in a p_cnct structure in a connect (0x01) request to port 3050/tcp, related to "an InterBase version of gds32.dll." Failed exploit attempts will likely cause a denial of service on the server.
