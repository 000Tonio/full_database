Direct static code injection vulnerability in dirsys/modules/config/post.php in JBC Explorer 7.20 RC1 and earlier allows remote authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary PHP code via the DEBUG parameter, which can be executed by accessing config.inc.php.  NOTE: this can be exploited by unauthenticated remote attackers by leveraging CVE-2007-5913.
