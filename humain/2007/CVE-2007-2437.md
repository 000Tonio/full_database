The X render (Xrender) extension in X.org X Window System 7.0, 7.1, and 7.2, with Xserver 1.3.0 and earlier, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via crafted values to the (1) XRenderCompositeTrapezoids and (2) XRenderAddTraps functions, which trigger a divide-by-zero error.
