Buffer overflow in Yahoo! Messenger 8.1 allows user-assisted remote authenticated users, who are listed in an address book, to execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors, aka ZD-00000005.  NOTE: this information is based upon a vague advisory by a vulnerability information sales organization that does not coordinate with vendors or release actionable advisories. A CVE has been assigned for tracking purposes, but duplicates with other CVEs are difficult to determine.

### CVSS Score: **6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
