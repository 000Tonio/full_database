Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Ip Reg 0.3 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the vlan_id parameter to (1) vlanview.php, (2) vlanedit.php, and (3) vlandel.php; the (4) assetclassgroup_id parameter to assetclassgroupview.php; the (5) subnet_id parameter to nodelist.php; and unspecified other vectors. NOTE: it was later reported that the vlanview.php and vlandel.php vectors are also in 0.4.
