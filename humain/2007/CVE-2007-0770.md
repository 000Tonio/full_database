# CVE-2007-0770

- Published: 2007-02-12T20:28:00

- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:34:00

Buffer overflow in GraphicsMagick and ImageMagick allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a PALM image that is not properly handled by the ReadPALMImage function in coders/palm.c. NOTE: this issue is due to an incomplete patch for CVE-2006-5456.
