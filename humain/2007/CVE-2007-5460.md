Microsoft ActiveSync 4.1, as used in Windows Mobile 5.0, uses weak encryption (XOR obfuscation with a fixed key) when sending the user's PIN/Password over the USB connection from the host to the device, which might make it easier for attackers to decode a PIN/Password obtained by (1) sniffing or (2) spoofing the docking process.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
