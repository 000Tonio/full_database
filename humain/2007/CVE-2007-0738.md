The Login Window in Apple Mac OS X 10.4 through 10.4.9 does not display the screen saver authentication dialog in certain circumstances when waking from sleep, even though the "require a password to wake the computer from sleep" option is enabled, which allows local users to bypass authentication controls.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
