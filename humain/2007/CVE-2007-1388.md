# CVE-2007-1388

- Published: 2007-03-10T19:19:00

- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:31:00

The do_ipv6_setsockopt function in net/ipv6/ipv6_sockglue.c in Linux kernel before 2.6.20, and possibly other versions, allows local users to cause a denial of service (oops) by calling setsockopt with the IPV6_RTHDR option name and possibly a zero option length or invalid option value, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference.

### CVSS Score: **4.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
