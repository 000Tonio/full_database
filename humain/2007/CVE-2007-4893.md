# CVE-2007-4893

- Published: 2007-09-14T18:17:00

- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:33:00

wp-admin/admin-functions.php in Wordpress before 2.2.3 and Wordpress multi-user (MU) before 1.2.5a does not properly verify the unfiltered_html privilege, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via modified data to (1) post.php or (2) page.php with a no_filter field. There is an input validation error in the wp-admin/admin-functions.php script when processing the no_filter parameter.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
