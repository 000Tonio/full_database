Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in edit.php in the MS TopSites add-on for PHP-Nuke does not verify that the uname parameter matches the current account, which allows remote authenticated users to change arbitrary accounts or change the SiteTitleName field as an arbitrary user via a modified uname value in an edit action to modules.php.
