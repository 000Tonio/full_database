# CVE-2007-5249

- Published: 2007-10-06T17:17:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:41:00

Multiple buffer overflows in the logging function in the Unreal engine, as used by America's Army and America's Army Special Forces 2.8.2 and earlier, when Punkbuster (PB) is enabled, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a long (1) PB_Y packet to the YPG server on UDP port 1716 or (2) PB_U packet to UCON on UDP port 1716, different vectors than CVE-2007-4442.  NOTE: this issue might be in Punkbuster itself, but there are insufficient details to be certain.
