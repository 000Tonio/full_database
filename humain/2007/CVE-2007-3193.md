lib/WikiUser/LDAP.php in PhpWiki before 1.3.13p1, when the configuration lacks a nonzero PASSWORD_LENGTH_MINIMUM, might allow remote attackers to bypass authentication via an empty password, which causes ldap_bind to return true when used with certain LDAP implementations.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
