# CVE-2007-2836

- Published: 2007-07-02T19:30:00

Directory traversal vulnerability in session.rb in Hiki 0.8.0 through 0.8.6 allows remote attackers to delete arbitrary files via directory traversal sequences in the session ID, which is matched against an insufficiently restrictive regular expression before it is used to construct a filename that is marked for deletion at logout. The vendor has addressed this issue through a product update: http://prdownloads.sourceforge.jp/hiki/25954/hiki-0.8.7.tar.gz
