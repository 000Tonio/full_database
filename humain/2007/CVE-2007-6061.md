# CVE-2007-6061

- Published: 2007-11-20T23:46:00

- Modified: 2022-02-07T19:43:00

Audacity 1.3.2 creates a temporary directory with a predictable name without checking for previous existence of that directory, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (recording deadlock) by creating the directory before Audacity is run.  NOTE: this issue can be leveraged to delete arbitrary files or directories via a symlink attack.

### CVSS Score: **5**
