# CVE-2007-4771

- Published: 2008-01-29T00:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:37:00

Heap-based buffer overflow in the doInterval function in regexcmp.cpp in libicu in International Components for Unicode (ICU) 3.8.1 and earlier allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) and possibly have unspecified other impact via a regular expression that writes a large amount of data to the backtracking stack.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
