# CVE-2007-4782

- Published: 2007-09-10T21:17:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:38:00

PHP before 5.2.3 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via (1) a long string in the pattern parameter to the glob function; or (2) a long string in the string parameter to the fnmatch function, accompanied by a pattern parameter value with undefined characteristics, as demonstrated by a "*[1]e" value.  NOTE: this might not be a vulnerability in most web server environments that support multiple threads, unless these issues can be demonstrated for code execution.
