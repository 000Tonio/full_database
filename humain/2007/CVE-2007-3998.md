# CVE-2007-3998

- Published: 2007-09-04T18:17:00

- Modified: 2018-10-26T13:59:00

The wordwrap function in PHP 4 before 4.4.8, and PHP 5 before 5.2.4, does not properly use the breakcharlen variable, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and application crash, or infinite loop) via certain arguments, as demonstrated by a 'chr(0), 0, ""' argument set.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
