# CVE-2007-0556

- Published: 2007-02-06T01:28:00

- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:33:00

The query planner in PostgreSQL before 8.0.11, 8.1 before 8.1.7, and 8.2 before 8.2.2 does not verify that a table is compatible with a "previously made query plan," which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (server crash) and possibly access database content via an "ALTER COLUMN TYPE" SQL statement, which can be leveraged to read arbitrary memory from the server.

### CVSS Score: **6.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | COMPLETE |
