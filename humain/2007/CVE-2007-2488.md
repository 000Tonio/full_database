# CVE-2007-2488

- Published: 2007-05-07T19:19:00

- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:31:00

The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) in Asterisk before 20070504 does not properly null terminate data, which allows remote attackers to trigger loss of transmitted data, and possibly obtain sensitive information (memory contents) or cause a denial of service (application crash), by sending a frame that lacks a 0 byte.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
