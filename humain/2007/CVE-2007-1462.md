The luci server component in conga preserves the password between page loads for the Add System/Cluster task flow by storing the password in the Value attribute of a password entry field, which allows attackers to steal the password by performing a "view source" or other operation to obtain the web page. NOTE: there are limited circumstances under which such an attack is feasible.
