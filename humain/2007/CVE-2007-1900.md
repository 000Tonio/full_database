# CVE-2007-1900

- Published: 2007-04-10T18:19:00

- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:32:00

CRLF injection vulnerability in the FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL filter in ext/filter in PHP 5.2.0 and 5.2.1 allows context-dependent attackers to inject arbitrary e-mail headers via an e-mail address with a '\n' character, which causes a regular expression to ignore the subsequent part of the address string.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
