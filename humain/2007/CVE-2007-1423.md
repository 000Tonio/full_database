Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in WORK system e-commerce 3.0.5 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the g_include parameter to include/include_top.php and certain other PHP scripts. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
