# CVE-2007-1901

- Published: 2007-05-14T21:19:00

SonicBB 1.0 allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via the (1) by[] parameter to search.php, (2) p[] parameter to viewforum.php, and the (3) id parameter to (a) viewforum.php or (b) members.php, which reveal the installation path in the resulting error message. Successful exploitation requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.
