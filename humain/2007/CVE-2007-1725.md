SQL injection vulnerability in index.php in IceBB 1.0-rc5 allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the filename of an uploaded file to the avatar function, as demonstrated by setting admin privileges. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain administrator privileges, but requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.
