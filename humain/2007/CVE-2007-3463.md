** DISPUTED **  Microsoft Windows XP SP2 allows local users, who have sessions created by another user's RunAs (run as) command, to kill arbitrary processes of this other user, as demonstrated by the taskkill program.  NOTE: the researcher claims a vendor dispute in which the vendor states that "RunAs and UAC are convenience features, not security boundaries. If you need a security guarantee, please log out and log back in with a different account."
