# CVE-2007-3598

- Published: 2007-07-06T19:30:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T21:26:00

index.php in vtiger CRM before 5.0.3 allows remote authenticated users to obtain all users' names and e-mail addresses, and possibly change user settings, via a modified record parameter in a DetailView action to the Users module.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the changing of settings, reporting that the attack vector results in a "You are not permitted to execute this Operation" error message in a 5.0.3 demo.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
