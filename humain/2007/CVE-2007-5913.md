dirsys/modules/auth.php in JBC Explorer 7.20 RC1 and earlier does not require authentication, which allows remote attackers to (1) delete auth.inc.php via the suppr parameter, and (2) re-create the auth.inc.php file with contents that specify a new account name and password for JBC Explorer via the login and password parameters.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
