# CVE-2007-2294

- Published: 2007-04-26T20:19:00

- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:43:00

The Manager Interface in Asterisk before 1.2.18 and 1.4.x before 1.4.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) by using MD5 authentication to authenticate a user that does not have a password defined in manager.conf, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference. Successful exploitation requires that the Management Interface is enabled and a user without a password is configured in the manager.conf file.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
