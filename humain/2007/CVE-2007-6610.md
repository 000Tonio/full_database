# CVE-2007-6610

- Published: 2008-01-03T20:46:00

- Modified: 2008-11-15T05:00:00

unp 1.0.12, and other versions before 1.0.14, does not properly escape file names, which might allow context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in a filename argument. NOTE: this might only be a vulnerability when unp is invoked by a third party product.
