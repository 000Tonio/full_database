# CVE-2007-1074

- Published: 2007-02-22T22:28:00

- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:31:00

Multiple buffer overflows in NewsBin Pro 5.33 and NewsBin Pro 4.x allow user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long (1) DataPath or (2) DownloadPath attributed in a (a) NBI file, or (3) a long group field in a (b) NZB file. Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary code, but requires that the user is tricked into e.g. loading a malicious NBI configuration file.
