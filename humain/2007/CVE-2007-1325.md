# CVE-2007-1325

- Published: 2007-03-07T21:19:00

- Modified: 2011-03-08T02:51:00

The PMA_ArrayWalkRecursive function in libraries/common.lib.php in phpMyAdmin before 2.10.0.2 does not limit recursion on arrays provided by users, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (web server crash) via an array with many dimensions.  NOTE: it could be argued that this vulnerability is caused by a problem in PHP (CVE-2006-1549) and the proper fix should be in PHP; if so, then this should not be treated as a vulnerability in phpMyAdmin. This vulnerability is addressed in the following product update:
