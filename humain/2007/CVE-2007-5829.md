The Disk Mount scanner in Symantec AntiVirus for Macintosh 9.x and 10.x, Norton AntiVirus for Macintosh 10.0 and 10.1, and Norton Internet Security for Macintosh 3.x, uses a directory with weak permissions (group writable), which allows local admin users to gain root privileges by replacing unspecified files, which are executed when a user with physical access inserts a disk and the "Show Progress During Mount Scans" option is enabled.
