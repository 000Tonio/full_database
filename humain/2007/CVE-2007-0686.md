The Intel 2200BG 802.11 Wireless Mini-PCI driver 9.0.3.9 (w29n51.sys) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) via crafted disassociation packets, which triggers memory corruption of "internal kernel structures," a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-6651.  NOTE: this issue might overlap CVE-2006-3992.
