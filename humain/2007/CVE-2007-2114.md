Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in Oracle Database 10.1.0.5 and 10.2.0.2 have unknown impact and remote authenticated attack vectors, related to (1) Change Data Capture (CDC), aka DB08, and (2) Oracle Instant Client, aka DB11.  NOTE: as of 20070424, oracle has not disputed reliable claims that these issues are buffer overflows using a long CHANGE_TABLE_NAME parameter to the DBMS_CDC_IPUBLISH.CHGTAB_CACHE procedure (DB08) and Oracle Instant Client genezi utility (DB11).
