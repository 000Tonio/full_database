WordPress 2.0.6, and 2.1Alpha 3 (SVN:4662), does not properly verify that the m parameter value has the string data type, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via an invalid m[] parameter, as demonstrated by obtaining the path, and obtaining certain SQL information such as the table prefix.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**
