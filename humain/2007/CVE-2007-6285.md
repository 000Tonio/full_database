# CVE-2007-6285

- Published: 2007-12-20T22:46:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:29:00

The default configuration for autofs 5 (autofs5) in some Linux distributions, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 4 and 5, does not specify the nodev mount option for the -hosts map, which allows local users to access "important devices" by operating a remote NFS server and creating special device files on that server, as demonstrated by the /dev/mem device.

### CVSS Score: **6.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
