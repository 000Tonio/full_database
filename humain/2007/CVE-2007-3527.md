# CVE-2007-3527

- Published: 2007-07-03T18:30:00

- Modified: 2012-10-31T02:39:00

Integer overflow in Firebird 2.0.0 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via certain database operations with multi-byte character sets that trigger an attempt to use the value 65536 for a 16-bit integer, which is treated as 0 and causes an infinite loop on zero-length data.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
