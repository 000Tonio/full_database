# CVE-2007-3691

- Published: 2007-07-11T17:30:00

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in changePW.php in AV Tutorial Script (avtutorial) 1.0, when magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) id and (2) userid parameters, a different issue than CVE-2007-3630. Successful exploitation allows e.g. to change the administrator's password but requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.
