- Published: 2007-06-19T17:30:00

content.php in WSPortal 1.0, when magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a "';" (quote semicolon) sequence in the page parameter, which reveals the installation path in the resulting forced SQL error message. Successful exploitation requires PHP magic_quotes_gpc set to OFF.

### CVSS Score: **5**
