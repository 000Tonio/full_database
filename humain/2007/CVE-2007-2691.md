MySQL before 4.1.23, 5.0.x before 5.0.42, and 5.1.x before 5.1.18 does not require the DROP privilege for RENAME TABLE statements, which allows remote authenticated users to rename arbitrary tables. The vendor has released a product update to address this issue:
Upgrade to MySQL version 5.1.18: http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/

### CVSS Score: **4.9**
