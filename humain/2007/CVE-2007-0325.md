Multiple buffer overflows in the Trend Micro OfficeScan Web-Deployment SetupINICtrl ActiveX control in OfficeScanSetupINI.dll, as used in OfficeScan 7.0 before Build 1344, OfficeScan 7.3 before Build 1241, and Client / Server / Messaging Security 3.0 before Build 1197, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted HTML document. Successful exploitation requires that OfficeScan client was installed using web deployment. The vendor has issued a fix (7.0 Security Patch - Build 1344; 7.3 Security Patch - Build 1241).
