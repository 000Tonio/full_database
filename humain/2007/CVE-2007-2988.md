A certain admin script in Inout Meta Search Engine sends a redirect to the web browser but does not exit when administrative credentials are missing, which allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary PHP code, as demonstrated by a request to admin/create_engine.php followed by a request to admin/generate_tabs.php.
