# CVE-2007-4319

- Published: 2007-08-13T21:17:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:34:00

The management interface in ZyNOS firmware 3.62(WK.6) on the Zyxel Zywall 2 device allows remote authenticated administrators to cause a denial of service (infinite reboot loop) via invalid configuration data.  NOTE: this issue might not cross privilege boundaries, and it might be resultant from CSRF; if so, then it should not be included in CVE.
