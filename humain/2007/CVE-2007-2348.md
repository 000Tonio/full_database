# CVE-2007-2348

- Published: 2007-04-27T18:19:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:17:00

mirror --script in lftp before 3.5.9 does not properly quote shell metacharacters, which might allow remote user-assisted attackers to execute shell commands via a malicious script. NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue crosses security boundaries, since the script already supports commands such as "get" which could overwrite executable files.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
