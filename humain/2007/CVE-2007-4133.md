# CVE-2007-4133

- Published: 2007-10-04T23:17:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:29:00

The (1) hugetlb_vmtruncate_list and (2) hugetlb_vmtruncate functions in fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.19-rc4 perform certain prio_tree calculations using HPAGE_SIZE instead of PAGE_SIZE units, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
