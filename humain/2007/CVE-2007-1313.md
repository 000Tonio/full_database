NETxAutomation NETxEIB OPC Server before 3.0.1300 does not properly validate OLE for Process Control (OPC) server handles, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors involving the (1) IOPCSyncIO::Read, (2) IOPCSyncIO::Write, (3) IOPCServer::AddGroup, (4) IOPCServer::RemoveGroup, (5) IOPCCommon::SetClientName, and (6) IOPCGroupStateMgt::CloneGroup functions, which allow access to arbitrary memory. NOTE: the vectors might be limited to attackers with physical access.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
