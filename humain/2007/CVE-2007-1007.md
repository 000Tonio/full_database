# CVE-2007-1007

- Published: 2007-02-20T17:28:00

- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:31:00

Format string vulnerability in GnomeMeeting 1.0.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via format strings in the name, which is not properly handled in a call to the gnomemeeting_log_insert function. Failed exploit attempts will like result in a system level denial-of-service condition. The product "GnomeMeeting" is now called "Ekiga".
