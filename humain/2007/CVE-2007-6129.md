# CVE-2007-6129

- Published: 2007-11-26T22:46:00

Directory traversal vulnerability in scripts/include/show_content.php in Amber Script 1.0 allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the id parameter.  NOTE: in some environments, this can be leveraged for remote file inclusion by using a UNC share pathname or an ftp, ftps, or ssh2.sftp URL. Successful exploitation requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.
