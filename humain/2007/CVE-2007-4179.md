Unspecified vulnerability in the Address and Routing Parameter Area (ARPA) transport functionality in HP-UX B.11.11 and B.11.23 allows local users to cause an unspecified denial of service via unknown vectors.  NOTE: this is probably different from CVE-2007-0916, but this is not certain due to lack of vendor details.
