Basic Analysis and Security Engine (BASE) before 1.3.8 sends a redirect to the web browser but does not exit, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via (1) base_main.php, (2) base_qry_alert.php, and possibly other vectors.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
