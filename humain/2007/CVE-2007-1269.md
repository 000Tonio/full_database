# CVE-2007-1269

- Published: 2007-03-06T20:19:00

- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:37:00

GNUMail 1.1.2 and earlier does not properly use the --status-fd argument when invoking GnuPG, which prevents GNUMail from visually distinguishing between signed and unsigned portions of OpenPGP messages with multiple components, which allows remote attackers to forge the contents of a message without detection.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
