# CVE-2007-1885

- Published: 2007-04-06T01:19:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:25:00

Integer overflow in the str_replace function in PHP 4 before 4.4.5 and PHP 5 before 5.2.1 allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a single character search string in conjunction with a long replacement string, which overflows a 32 bit length counter.  NOTE: this is probably the same issue as CVE-2007-0906.6.
