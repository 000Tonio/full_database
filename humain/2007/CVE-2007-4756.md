Directory traversal vulnerability in the FTP client in Total Commander before 7.02 allows remote FTP servers to create or overwrite arbitrary files via "..\" (dot dot backslash) sequences in a filename.  NOTE: the "..\" are not displayed when the user lists files.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for code execution by writing to a Startup folder.
