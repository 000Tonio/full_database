# CVE-2007-1413

- Published: 2007-03-12T23:19:00

Buffer overflow in the snmpget function in the snmp extension in PHP 5.2.3 and earlier, including PHP 4.4.6 and probably other PHP 4 versions, allows context-dependent attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long value in the third argument (object id). Failed exploit attempts will likely cause a denial of serivce on the webserver.
