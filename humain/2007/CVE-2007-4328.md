Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in Mapos Bilder Galerie 1.0 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the config[root_ordner] parameter to (1) index.php, (2) galerie.php, or (3) anzagien.php.  NOTE: A later report states that 1.1 is also affected, but that the filename for vector 3 is anzeigen.php.
