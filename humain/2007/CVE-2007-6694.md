- Published: 2008-01-29T20:00:00

The chrp_show_cpuinfo function (chrp/setup.c) in Linux kernel 2.4.21 through 2.6.18-53, when running on PowerPC, might allow local users to cause a denial of service (crash) via unknown vectors that cause the of_get_property function to fail, which triggers a NULL pointer dereference.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
