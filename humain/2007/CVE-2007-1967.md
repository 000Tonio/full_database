** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in index.php in stat12 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the langpath parameter.  NOTE: this issue was published by an unreliable researcher, and there is little information to determine which product is actually affected.  This is probably an invalid report based on analysis by CVE and a third party.
