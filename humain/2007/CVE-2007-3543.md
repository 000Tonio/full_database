Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in WordPress before 2.2.1 and WordPress MU before 1.2.3 allows remote authenticated users to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code by making a post that specifies a .php filename in the _wp_attached_file metadata field; and then sending this file's content, along with its post_ID value, to (1) wp-app.php or (2) app.php. Successful exploitation requires valid Editor credentials and that the system is configured to allow uploads.
