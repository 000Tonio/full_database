LScube Feng 0.1.15 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL dereference and daemon crash) via (1) a malformed Transport header, which triggers misparsing in parse_transport_header in RTSP_setup.c, as demonstrated by a Transport header that contains only a "RTP/AVP;unicast;client_port" sequence; or (2) a malformed Range header, which triggers misparsing in parse_play_time_range in RTSP_Play, as demonstrated by an empty Range header.

### CVSS Score: **5**
