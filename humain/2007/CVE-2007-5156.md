Incomplete blacklist vulnerability in editor/filemanager/upload/php/upload.php in FCKeditor, as used in SiteX CMS 0.7.3.beta, La-Nai CMS, Syntax CMS, Cardinal Cms, and probably other products, allows remote attackers to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code via a file whose name contains ".php." and has an unknown extension, which is recognized as a .php file by the Apache HTTP server, a different vulnerability than CVE-2006-0658 and CVE-2006-2529.
