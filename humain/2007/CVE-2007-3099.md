usr/mgmt_ipc.c in iscsid in open-iscsi (iscsi-initiator-utils) before 2.0-865 checks the client's UID on the listening AF_LOCAL socket instead of the new connection, which allows remote attackers to access the management interface and cause a denial of service (iscsid exit or iSCSI connection loss).

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
