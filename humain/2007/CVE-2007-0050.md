** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in index.php in OpenPinboard 2.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the language parameter.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the developer and a third party, since the variable is set before use. CVE analysis suggests that there is a small time window of risk before the installation is complete.
