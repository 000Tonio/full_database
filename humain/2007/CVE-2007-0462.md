The _GetSrcBits32ARGB function in Apple QuickDraw, as used by Quicktime 7.1.3 and other applications on Mac OS X 10.4.8 and earlier, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted PICT image with a malformed Alpha RGB (ARGB) record, which triggers memory corruption.
