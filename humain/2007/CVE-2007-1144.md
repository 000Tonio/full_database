Directory traversal vulnerability in jwpn-photos.php in J-Web Pics Navigator 2.0 allows remote attackers to list arbitrary directories via a .. (dot dot) in the dir parameter. J-Web Pics Navigator is prone to a directory-traversal vulnerability because it fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input. 

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to retrieve and edit the contents of arbitrary files from the vulnerable system in the context of the affected application.

J-Web Pics Navigator 2.0 is vulnerable to this issue; other versions may also be affected.
