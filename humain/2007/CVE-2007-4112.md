# CVE-2007-4112

- Published: 2007-07-31T10:17:00

- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:32:00

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Advanced Webhost Billing System (AWBS) before 2.6.0, when magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for XSS attacks that "bypass AWBS's anti-XSS input validation."

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
