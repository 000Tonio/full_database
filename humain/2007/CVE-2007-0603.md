PGP Desktop before 9.5.1 does not validate data objects received over the (1) \pipe\pgpserv named pipe for PGPServ.exe or the (2) \pipe\pgpsdkserv named pipe for PGPsdkServ.exe, which allows remote authenticated users to gain privileges by sending a data object representing an absolute pointer, which causes code execution at the corresponding address.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
