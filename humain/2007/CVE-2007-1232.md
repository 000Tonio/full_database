Directory traversal vulnerability in SQLiteManager 1.2.0 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in a SQLiteManager_currentTheme cookie. Successful exploitation requires that "magic_quotes_gpc" is disabled.  Additionally, in order to exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code, the attacker would first be required to upload a malicious file or inject arbitrary commands into an existing file.
