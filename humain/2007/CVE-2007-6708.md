Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities on the Cisco Linksys WAG54GS Wireless-G ADSL Gateway with 1.01.03 and earlier firmware allow remote attackers to perform actions as administrators via an arbitrary valid request to an administrative URI, as demonstrated by (1) a Restore Factory Defaults action using the mtenRestore parameter to setup.cgi and (2) creation of a user account using the sysname parameter to setup.cgi.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
