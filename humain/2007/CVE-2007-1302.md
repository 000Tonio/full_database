SQL injection vulnerability in guestbook.php in LI-Guestbook 1.1, when magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the country parameter.  NOTE: it was later reported that 1.2 is also affected. Successful exploitation requires "magic_quotes_gpc" to be disabled.
