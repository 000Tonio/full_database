** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in preview.php in the swMenuFree (com_swmenufree) 4.6 component for Joomla! allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the mosConfig_absolute_path parameter.  NOTE: a reliable third party disputes this issue because preview.php tests a certain constant to prevent direct requests.
