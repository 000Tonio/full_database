Format string vulnerability in the MprLogToFile::logEvent function in Mbedthis AppWeb 2.0.5-4, when the build supports logging but the configuration disables logging, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via format string specifiers in the HTTP scheme, as demonstrated by a "GET %n://localhost:80/" request.
