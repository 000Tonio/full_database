Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in functions.php in the default theme in WordPress 2.2 allows remote authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the PATH_INFO (REQUEST_URI) to wp-admin/themes.php, a different vulnerability than CVE-2007-1622.  NOTE: this might not cross privilege boundaries in some configurations, since the Administrator role has the unfiltered_html capability.

### CVSS Score: **6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
