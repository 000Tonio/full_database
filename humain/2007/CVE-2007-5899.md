# CVE-2007-5899

- Published: 2007-11-20T19:46:00

- Modified: 2018-10-15T21:46:00

The output_add_rewrite_var function in PHP before 5.2.5 rewrites local forms in which the ACTION attribute references a non-local URL, which allows remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information by reading the requests for this URL, as demonstrated by a rewritten form containing a local session ID.
