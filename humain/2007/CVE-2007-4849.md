# CVE-2007-4849

- Published: 2007-09-12T20:17:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T21:29:00

JFFS2, as used on One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) build 542 and possibly other Linux systems, when POSIX ACL support is enabled, does not properly store permissions during (1) inode creation or (2) ACL setting, which might allow local users to access restricted files or directories after a remount of a filesystem, related to "legacy modes" and an inconsistency between dentry permissions and inode permissions.

### CVSS Score: **4.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
