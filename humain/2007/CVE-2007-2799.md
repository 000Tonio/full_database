# CVE-2007-2799

- Published: 2007-05-23T21:30:00

- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:45:00

Integer overflow in the "file" program 4.20, when running on 32-bit systems, as used in products including The Sleuth Kit, might allow user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via a large file that triggers an overflow that bypasses an assert() statement.  NOTE: this issue is due to an incorrect patch for CVE-2007-1536.
