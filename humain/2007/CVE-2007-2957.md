Integer overflow in McAfee E-Business Server before 8.5.3 for Solaris, and before 8.1.2 for Linux, HP-UX, and AIX, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a large length value in an authentication packet, which results in a heap-based buffer overflow.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
