# CVE-2007-2172

- Published: 2007-04-22T19:19:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T18:59:00

A typo in Linux kernel 2.6 before 2.6.21-rc6 and 2.4 before 2.4.35 causes RTA_MAX to be used as an array size instead of RTN_MAX, which leads to an "out of bound access" by the (1) dn_fib_props (dn_fib.c, DECNet) and (2) fib_props (fib_semantics.c, IPv4) functions.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
