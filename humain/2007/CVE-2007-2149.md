Stephen Craton (aka WiredPHP) Chatness 2.5.3 and earlier stores usernames and unencrypted passwords in (1) classes/vars.php and (2) classes/varstuff.php, and recommends 0666 or 0777 permissions for these files, which allows local users to gain privileges by reading the files, and allows remote attackers to obtain credentials via a direct request for admin/options.php.
