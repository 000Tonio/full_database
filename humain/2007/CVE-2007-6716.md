- Published: 2008-09-04T17:41:00

- Modified: 2020-08-14T15:40:00

fs/direct-io.c in the dio subsystem in the Linux kernel before 2.6.23 does not properly zero out the dio struct, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS), as demonstrated by a certain fio test.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
