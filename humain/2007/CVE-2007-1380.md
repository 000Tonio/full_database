# CVE-2007-1380

- Published: 2007-03-10T00:19:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:25:00

The php_binary serialization handler in the session extension in PHP before 4.4.5, and 5.x before 5.2.1, allows context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information (memory contents) via a serialized variable entry with a large length value, which triggers a buffer over-read.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
