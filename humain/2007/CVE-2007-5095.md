Microsoft Windows Media Player (WMP) 9 on Windows XP SP2 invokes Internet Explorer to render HTML documents contained inside some media files, regardless of what default web browser is configured, which might allow remote attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in software that the user does not expect to run, as demonstrated by the HTMLView parameter in an .asx file.
