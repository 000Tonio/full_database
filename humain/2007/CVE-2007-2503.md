** DISPUTED **  Directory traversal vulnerability in turbulence.php in PHP Turbulence 0.0.1 alpha allows remote attackers to include and execute arbitrary local files via a .. (dot dot) in the GLOBALS[tcore] parameter.  NOTE: this vulnerability is disputed by CVE and a reliable third party because a direct request to user/turbulence.php triggers a fatal error before inclusion.
