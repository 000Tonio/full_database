Stack-based buffer overflow in the giomgr process in ESRI ArcSDE service 9.2, as used with ArcGIS, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a large number that requires more than 8 bytes to represent in ASCII, which triggers the overflow in an sprintf function call.
