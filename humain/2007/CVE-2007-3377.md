Header.pm in Net::DNS before 0.60, a Perl module, (1) generates predictable sequence IDs with a fixed increment and (2) can use the same starting ID for all child processes of a forking server, which allows remote attackers to spoof DNS responses, as originally reported for qpsmtp and spamassassin.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
