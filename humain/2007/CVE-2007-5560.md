Heap-based buffer overflow in the Juniper HTTP Service allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted HTTP packet.  NOTE: as of 20071016, the only disclosure is a vague pre-advisory with no actionable information. However, since it is from a well-known researcher, it is being assigned a CVE identifier for tracking purposes.
