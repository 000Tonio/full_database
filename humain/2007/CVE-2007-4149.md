# CVE-2007-4149

- Published: 2007-08-03T20:17:00

The Visionsoft Audit on Demand Service (VSAOD) in Visionsoft Audit 12.4.0.0 does not require authentication for (1) the "LOG." command, which allows remote attackers to create or overwrite arbitrary files; (2) the SETTINGSFILE command, which allows remote attackers to overwrite the ini file, and reconfigure VSAOD or cause a denial of service; or (3) the UNINSTALL command, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon shutdown).  NOTE: vector 1 can be leveraged for code execution by writing to a Startup folder.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
