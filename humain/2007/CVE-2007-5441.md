CMS Made Simple 1.1.3.1 does not check the permissions assigned to users in some situations, which allows remote authenticated users to perform some administrative actions, as demonstrated by (1) adding a user via a direct request to admin/adduser.php and (2) reading the admin log via an "admin/adminlog.php?page=1" request.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
