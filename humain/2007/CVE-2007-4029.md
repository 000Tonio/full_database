libvorbis 1.1.2, and possibly other versions before 1.2.0, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service via (1) an invalid mapping type, which triggers an out-of-bounds read in the vorbis_info_clear function in info.c, and (2) invalid blocksize values that trigger a segmentation fault in the read function in block.c. Vendor has issued upgrade for this vulnerability: https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1590
