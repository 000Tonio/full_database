The Intersil isl3893 extensions for Boa 0.93.15, as used on the FreeLan RO80211G-AP and other devices, do not prevent stack writes from entering memory locations used for string constants, which allows remote attackers to change the admin password stored in memory via a long username in an HTTP Basic Authentication request.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
