Buffer overflow in the open_sty function in mkind.c for makeindex 2.14 in teTeX might allow user-assisted remote attackers to overwrite files and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long filename.  NOTE: other overflows exist but might not be exploitable, such as a heap-based overflow in the check_idx function.
