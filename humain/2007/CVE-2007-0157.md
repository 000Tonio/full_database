# CVE-2007-0157

- Published: 2007-01-09T21:28:00

- Modified: 2011-03-08T02:48:00

Array index error in the uri_lookup function in the URI parser for neon 0.26.0 to 0.26.2, possibly only on 64-bit platforms, allows remote malicious servers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a URI with non-ASCII characters, which triggers a buffer under-read due to a type conversion error that generates a negative index.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
