# CVE-2007-3930

- Published: 2007-07-21T00:30:00

- Modified: 2021-07-23T15:12:00

Interpretation conflict between Microsoft Internet Explorer and DocuWiki before 2007-06-26b allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks when spellchecking UTF-8 encoded messages via the spell_utf8test function in lib/exe/spellcheck.php, which triggers HTML document identification and script execution by Internet Explorer even though the Content-Type header is text/plain.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
