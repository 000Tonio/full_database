The American Power Conversion (APC) AP7932 0u 30amp Switched Rack Power Distribution Unit (PDU), with rpdu 3.5.5 and aos 3.5.6, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and obtain login access by making a login attempt while a different client is logged in, and then resubmitting the login attempt once the other client exits.
