AhnLab Antivirus 3 Internet Security 2008 Platinum appends data to a filename string at a location indicated by the "Filename length" field in a ZIP header, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (machine crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a ZIP file in which this field's value is larger than the actual number of bytes in the filename.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**
