# CVE-2007-3106

- Published: 2007-07-26T21:30:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:17:00

lib/info.c in libvorbis 1.1.2, and possibly other versions before 1.2.0, allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via invalid (1) blocksize_0 and (2) blocksize_1 values, which trigger a "heap overwrite" in the _01inverse function in res0.c. NOTE: this issue has been RECAST so that CVE-2007-4029 handles additional vectors.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
