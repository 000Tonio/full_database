# CVE-2007-5938

- Published: 2007-12-06T15:46:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:29:00

The iwl_set_rate function in compatible/iwl3945-base.c in iwlwifi 1.1.21 and earlier dereferences an iwl_get_hw_mode return value without checking for NULL, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (kernel panic) via unspecified vectors during module initialization.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
