Credant Mobile Guardian Shield for Windows 5.2.1.105 and earlier stores account names and passwords in plaintext in memory, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by (1) reading the paging file or (2) dumping and searching the memory image.  NOTE: This issue crosses privilege boundaries because the product is intended to protect the data on a stolen computer. This issue is addressed in patch version 5.2.1.125 of this product.
