Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Contact Details functionality in Yahoo! Messenger 8.1.0.209 and earlier allow user-assisted remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a javascript: URI in the SRC attribute of an IMG element to the (1) First Name, (2) Last Name, and (3) Nickname fields.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information. Access Complexity: Successful exploitation requires that the attacker is in the messenger list of the target.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
