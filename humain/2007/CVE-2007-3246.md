# CVE-2007-3246

- Published: 2007-06-15T01:30:00

- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:32:00

The do_set_password function in modules/chanserv/set.c in IRC Services before 5.0.60 preserves channel founder privileges across a channel password change (ChanServ SET PASSWORD), which allows remote authenticated users to obtain the new password through automated e-mail, or perform privileged actions without knowing the new password.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
