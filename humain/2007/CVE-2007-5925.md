- Modified: 2018-10-03T21:50:00

The convert_search_mode_to_innobase function in ha_innodb.cc in the InnoDB engine in MySQL 5.1.23-BK and earlier allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (database crash) via a certain CONTAINS operation on an indexed column, which triggers an assertion error.

| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
