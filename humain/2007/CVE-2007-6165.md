Mail in Apple Mac OS X Leopard (10.5.1) allows user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an AppleDouble attachment containing an apparently-safe file type and script in a resource fork, which does not warn the user that a separate program is going to be executed.  NOTE: this is a regression error related to CVE-2006-0395.
