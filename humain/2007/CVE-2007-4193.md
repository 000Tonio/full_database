# CVE-2007-4193

- Published: 2007-08-08T01:17:00

- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:32:00

Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in index.php in IDE Group DVD Rental System (DRS) 5.1 before 20070801 allow remote attackers to perform certain actions as arbitrary users, as demonstrated by (1) modifying data or (2) canceling a subscription. NOTE: it is not clear whether IDE Group updates all DRS installations in its role as an application service provider. If so, then this issue should not be included in CVE.
