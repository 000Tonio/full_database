Cisco Clean Access (CCA) 3.5.x through 3.5.9 and 3.6.x through 3.6.1.1 on the Clean Access Manager (CAM) allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and download arbitrary manual database backups by guessing the snapshot filename using brute force, then making a direct request for the file.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
