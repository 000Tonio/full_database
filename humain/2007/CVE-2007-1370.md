# CVE-2007-1370

- Published: 2007-03-09T22:19:00

- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:30:00

Zend Platform 2.2.3 and earlier has incorrect ownership for scd.sh and certain other files, which allows local users to gain root privileges by modifying the files.  NOTE: this only occurs when safe_mode and open_basedir are disabled; other settings require leverage for other vulnerabilities.
