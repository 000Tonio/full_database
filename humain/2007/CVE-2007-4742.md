- Published: 2007-09-06T19:17:00

Claroline before 1.8.6 allows remote authenticated administrators to obtain sensitive information via an invalid value in the sort parameter to admin/adminusers.php, which reveals the path in an error message in some circumstances, as demonstrated by a parameter value containing an XSS sequence.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
