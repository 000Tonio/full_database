Integer overflow in the gifGetBandProc function in ImageIO in Apple Mac OS X 10.4.8 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted GIF image that triggers the overflow during decompression.  NOTE: this is a different issue than CVE-2006-3502 and CVE-2006-3503.
