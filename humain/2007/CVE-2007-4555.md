Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Ipswitch WS_FTP allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via arguments to a valid command, which is not properly handled when it is displayed by the view log option in the administration interface.  NOTE: this can be leveraged to create a new admin account.
