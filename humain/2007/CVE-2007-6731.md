# CVE-2007-6731

- Published: 2009-09-13T22:30:00

Extended Module Player (XMP) 2.5.1 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via an OXM file with a negative value, which bypasses a check in (1) test_oxm and (2) decrunch_oxm functions in misc/oxm.c, leading to a buffer overflow.

### CVSS Score: **10**
