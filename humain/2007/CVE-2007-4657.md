# CVE-2007-4657

- Published: 2007-09-04T22:17:00

- Modified: 2018-10-26T14:05:00

Multiple integer overflows in PHP 4 before 4.4.8, and PHP 5 before 5.2.4, allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (memory contents) or cause a denial of service (thread crash) via a large len value to the (1) strspn or (2) strcspn function, which triggers an out-of-bounds read.  NOTE: this affects different product versions than CVE-2007-3996.
