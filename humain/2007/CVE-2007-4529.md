The WebAdmin interface in TeamSpeak Server 2.0.20.1 allows remote authenticated users with the ServerAdmin flag to assign Registered users certain privileges, resulting in a privilege set that extends beyond that ServerAdmin's own servers, as demonstrated by the (1) AdminAddServer, (2) AdminDeleteServer, (3) AdminStartServer, and (4) AdminStopServer privileges; and administration of arbitrary virtual servers via a request to a .tscmd URI with a modified serverid parameter, as demonstrated by (a) add_server.tscmd, (b) ask_delete_server.tscmd, (c) start_server.tscmd, and (d) stop_server.tscmd.
