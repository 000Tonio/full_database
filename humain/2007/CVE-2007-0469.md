- Published: 2007-01-24T01:28:00

- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:32:00

The extract_files function in installer.rb in RubyGems before 0.9.1 does not check whether files exist before overwriting them, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files, cause a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code via crafted GEM packages.
