# CVE-2007-5168

Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in ClanLite 1.23.01.2005 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the root_path parameter to (1) modules/serveur_jeux.php or (2) conf/conf-php.php.  NOTE: vector 1 is disputed by CVE because the require_once is only reached when a certain constant has already been defined.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
