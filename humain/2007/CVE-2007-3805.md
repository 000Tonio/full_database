- Published: 2007-07-16T23:30:00

- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:32:00

The IKE implementation in Clavister CorePlus before 8.80.03, and 8.80.00, does not properly validate certificates during IKE negotiation, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (gateway stop) via certain certificates.

### CVSS Score: **5.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |
