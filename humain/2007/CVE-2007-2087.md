Multiple PHP remote file inclusion vulnerabilities in CNStats 2.12, when register_globals is enabled and .htaccess is not recognized, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the bn parameter to (1) who_r.php or (2) who_s.php in reports/.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled and support for ".htaccess" files is disabled.
