# CVE-2007-2618

- Published: 2007-05-11T16:19:00

CRLF injection vulnerability in index.php in Drake CMS 0.4.0 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary HTTP headers and conduct HTTP response splitting attacks via CRLF sequences in the lang parameter. NOTE: Drake CMS has only a beta version available, and the vendor has previously stated "We do not consider security reports valid until the first official release of Drake CMS." In order to make the exploit work, the attacker would have to craft a webpage (hosted on the same domain as the Drake CMS website) and have the Drake CMS user make a post from that page.
Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.
