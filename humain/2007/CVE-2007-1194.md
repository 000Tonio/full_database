# CVE-2007-1194

- Published: 2007-03-02T21:18:00

- Modified: 2018-10-16T16:37:00

Norman SandBox Analyzer does not use the proper range for Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) entries, which allows local users to determine that the local machine is an emulator, or a similar environment not based on a physical Intel processor, which allows attackers to produce malware that is more difficult to analyze.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
