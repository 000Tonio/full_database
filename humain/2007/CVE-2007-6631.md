Multiple buffer overflows in LScube libnemesi 0.6.4-rc1 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) a reply that begins with a long version string, which triggers an overflow in handle_rtsp_pkt in rtsp_handlers.c; long headers that trigger overflows in (2) send_pause_request, (3) send_play_request, (4) send_setup_request, or (5) send_teardown_request in rtsp_send.c, as demonstrated by the Content-Base header; or a long Transport header, which triggers an overflow in (6) get_transport_str_sctp, (7) get_transport_str_tcp, or (8) get_transport_str_udp in rtsp_transport.c.
