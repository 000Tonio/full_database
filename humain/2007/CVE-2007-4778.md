Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the content component (com_content) in Joomla! 1.5 Beta1, Beta2, and RC1 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the filter parameter in an archive action to (1) archive.php, (2) category.php, or (3) section.php in models/.  NOTE: this may be the same as CVE-2007-4777.
