# CVE-2007-3641

- Published: 2007-07-14T00:30:00

- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:32:00

archive_read_support_format_tar.c in libarchive before 2.2.4 does not properly compute the length of a certain buffer when processing a malformed pax extension header, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted (1) PAX or (2) TAR archive that triggers a buffer overflow.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
