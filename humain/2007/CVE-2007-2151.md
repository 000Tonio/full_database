The administration server in McAfee e-Business Server before 8.1.1 and 8.5.x before 8.5.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (service crash) via a large length value in a malformed authentication packet, which triggers a heap over-read. The vendor has addressed this issue in the following product update:
