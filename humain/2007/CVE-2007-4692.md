# CVE-2007-4692

- Published: 2007-11-15T00:46:00

The tabbed browsing feature in Apple Safari 3 before Beta Update 3.0.4 on Windows, and Mac OS X 10.4 through 10.4.10, allows remote attackers to spoof HTTP authentication for other sites and possibly conduct phishing attacks by causing an authentication sheet to be displayed for a tab that is not active, which makes it appear as if it is associated with the active tab.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
