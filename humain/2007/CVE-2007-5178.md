# CVE-2007-5178

- Published: 2007-10-03T14:17:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:29:00

contrib/mx_glance_sdesc.php in the mx_glance 2.3.3 module for mxBB places a critical security check within a comment because of a missing comment delimiter, which allows remote attackers to conduct remote file inclusion attacks and execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the mx_root_path parameter.  NOTE: some sources incorrectly state that phpbb_root_path is the affected parameter.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
