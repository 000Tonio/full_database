# CVE-2007-1359

- Published: 2007-03-08T22:19:00

Interpretation conflict in ModSecurity (mod_security) 2.1.0 and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass request rules via application/x-www-form-urlencoded POST data that contains an ASCIIZ (0x00) byte, which mod_security treats as a terminator even though it is still processed as normal data by some HTTP parsers including PHP 5.2.0, and possibly parsers in Perl, and Python.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
