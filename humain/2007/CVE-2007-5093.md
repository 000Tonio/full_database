# CVE-2007-5093

- Published: 2007-09-26T21:17:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:18:00

The disconnect method in the Philips USB Webcam (pwc) driver in Linux kernel 2.6.x before 2.6.22.6 "relies on user space to close the device," which allows user-assisted local attackers to cause a denial of service (USB subsystem hang and CPU consumption in khubd) by not closing the device after the disconnect is invoked. NOTE: this rarely crosses privilege boundaries, unless the attacker can convince the victim to unplug the affected device.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
