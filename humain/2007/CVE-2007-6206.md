# CVE-2007-6206

- Published: 2007-12-04T00:46:00

- Modified: 2020-08-12T19:26:00

The do_coredump function in fs/exec.c in Linux kernel 2.4.x and 2.6.x up to 2.6.24-rc3, and possibly other versions, does not change the UID of a core dump file if it exists before a root process creates a core dump in the same location, which might allow local users to obtain sensitive information.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
