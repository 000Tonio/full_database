** DISPUTED **  PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in inc-calcul.php3 in SPIP 1.7.2 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via a URL in the squelette_cache parameter, a different vector than CVE-2006-1702. NOTE: this issue has been disputed by third party researchers, stating that the squelette_cache variable is initialized before use, and is only used within the scope of a function.
