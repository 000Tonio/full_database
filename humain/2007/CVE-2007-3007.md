# CVE-2007-3007

- Published: 2007-06-04T17:30:00

- Modified: 2022-08-29T20:07:00

PHP 5 before 5.2.3 does not enforce the open_basedir or safe_mode restriction in certain cases, which allows context-dependent attackers to determine the existence of arbitrary files by checking if the readfile function returns a string.  NOTE: this issue might also involve the realpath function.

### CVSS Score: **5**
