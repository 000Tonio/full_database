# CVE-2007-0267

- Published: 2007-01-17T00:28:00

- Modified: 2011-06-10T04:00:00

The ufs_lookup function in the Mac OS X 10.4.8 and FreeBSD 6.1 kernels allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel panic) and possibly corrupt other filesystems by mounting a crafted UNIX File System (UFS) DMG image that contains a corrupted directory entry (struct direct), related to the ufs_dirbad function.  NOTE: a third party states that the FreeBSD issue does not cross privilege boundaries.

### CVSS Score: **6.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
