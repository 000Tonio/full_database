Ghost Security Suite alpha 1.200 does not properly validate certain parameters to System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) function handlers, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly gain privileges via the (1) NtCreateKey, (2) NtCreateThread, (3) NtDeleteValueKey, (4) NtQueryValueKey, (5) NtSetSystemInformation, and (6) NtSetValueKey kernel SSDT hooks.
