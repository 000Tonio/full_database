# CVE-2007-3769

- Published: 2007-07-15T21:30:00

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the mirrored server management interface in SurgeFTP 2.3a1 allows user-assisted, remote FTP servers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a malformed response without a status code, which is reflected to the user in the resulting error message.  NOTE: this can be leveraged for root access via a sequence of steps involving web script that creates a new FTP user account.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
