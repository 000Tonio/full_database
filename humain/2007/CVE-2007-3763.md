# CVE-2007-3763

- Published: 2007-07-18T17:30:00

- Modified: 2011-03-08T02:57:00

The IAX2 channel driver (chan_iax2) in Asterisk before 1.2.22 and 1.4.x before 1.4.8, Business Edition before B.2.2.1, AsteriskNOW before beta7, Appliance Developer Kit before 0.5.0, and s800i before 1.0.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted (1) LAGRQ or (2) LAGRP frame that contains information elements of IAX frames, which results in a NULL pointer dereference when Asterisk does not properly set an associated variable.
