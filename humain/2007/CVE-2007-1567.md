# CVE-2007-1567

- Published: 2007-03-21T21:19:00

- Modified: 2011-03-08T02:52:00

Stack-based buffer overflow in War FTP Daemon 1.65, and possibly earlier, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code via unspecified vectors, as demonstrated by warftp_165.tar by Immunity.  NOTE: this might be the same issue as CVE-1999-0256, CVE-2000-0131, or CVE-2006-2171, but due to Immunity's lack of details, this cannot be certain.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
