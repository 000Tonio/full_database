Norton Internet Security 2008 15.0.0.60 does not properly validate certain parameters to System Service Descriptor Table (SSDT) function handlers, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly gain privileges via the NtOpenSection kernel SSDT hook.  NOTE: the NtCreateMutant and NtOpenEvent function hooks are already covered by CVE-2007-1793.
