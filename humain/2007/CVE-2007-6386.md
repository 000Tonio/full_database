- Published: 2007-12-15T02:46:00

Stack-based buffer overflow in PccScan.dll before build 1451 in Trend Micro AntiVirus plus AntiSpyware 2008, Internet Security 2008, and Internet Security Pro 2008 allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (SfCtlCom.exe crash), and allows local users to gain privileges, via a malformed .zip archive with a long name, as demonstrated by a .zip file created via format string specifiers in a crafted .uue file.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
