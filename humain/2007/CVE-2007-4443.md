The UCC dedicated server for the Unreal engine, possibly 2003 and 2004, on Windows allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (continuous beep and server slowdown) via a string containing many 0x07 characters in (1) a request to the images/ directory, (2) the Content-Type field, (3) a HEAD request, and possibly other unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **5**
