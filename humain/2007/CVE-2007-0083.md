Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Nuked Klan 1.7 and earlier allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a javascript: URI in a getURL statement in a .swf file, as demonstrated by "Remote Cookie Disclosure."  NOTE: it could be argued that this is an issue in Shockwave instead of Nuked Klan.
