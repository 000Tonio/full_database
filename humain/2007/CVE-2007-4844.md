X-Diesel Unreal Commander 0.92 build 565 and 573 does not properly react to an FTP server's behavior after sending a "CWD /" command, which allows remote FTP servers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) by (1) repeatedly sending a 550 error response, or (2) sending a 550 error response and then disconnecting.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
