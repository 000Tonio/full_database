# CVE-2007-4416

** DISPUTED **  captcha.php in BellaBook (aka BellaBuffs) allows remote attackers to obtain administrative privileges by sending the admin's username (admin_name) in a pheap_login cookie.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this vulnerability because authentication data is derived from the admin_pass and secret variables, in addition to the admin_name; and because the exploit code is designed for an unrelated application.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
