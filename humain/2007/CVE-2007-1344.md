# CVE-2007-1344

- Published: 2007-03-08T22:19:00

- Modified: 2021-07-12T17:11:00

Multiple buffer overflows in src/ezstream.c in Ezstream before 0.3.0 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted XML configuration file processed by the (1) urlParse function, which causes a stack-based overflow and the (2) ReplaceString function, which causes a heap-based overflow.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
