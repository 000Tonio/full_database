# CVE-2007-0006

- Published: 2007-02-06T19:28:00

- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:31:00

The key serial number collision avoidance code in the key_alloc_serial function in Linux kernel 2.6.9 up to 2.6.20 allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) via vectors that trigger a null dereference, as originally reported as "spinlock CPU recursion." The scheme for selecting serial numbers was changed from incrementing a counter to random number selection, increasing the likelihood of a serial number collision.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
