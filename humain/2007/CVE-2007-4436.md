# CVE-2007-4436

- Published: 2007-08-20T22:17:00

- Modified: 2017-07-29T01:32:00

The Drupal Project module before 5.x-1.0, 4.7.x-2.3, and 4.7.x-1.3 and Project issue tracking module before 5.x-1.0, 4.7.x-2.4, and 4.7.x-1.4 do not properly enforce permissions, which allows remote attackers to (1) obtain sensitive via the Tracker Module and the Recent posts page; (2) obtain project names via unspecified vectors; (3) obtain sensitive information via the statistics pages; and (4) read CVS project activity.

### CVSS Score: **5**
