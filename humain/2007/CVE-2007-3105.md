# CVE-2007-3105

- Published: 2007-07-27T21:30:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:17:00

Stack-based buffer overflow in the random number generator (RNG) implementation in the Linux kernel before 2.6.22 might allow local root users to cause a denial of service or gain privileges by setting the default wakeup threshold to a value greater than the output pool size, which triggers writing random numbers to the stack by the pool transfer function involving "bound check ordering". NOTE: this issue might only cross privilege boundaries in environments that have granular assignment of privileges for root.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**
