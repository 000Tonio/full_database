- Published: 2007-12-14T20:46:00

- Modified: 2011-08-08T04:00:00

scponly 4.6 and earlier allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended restrictions and execute code by invoking dangerous subcommands including (1) unison, (2) rsync, (3) svn, and (4) svnserve, as originally demonstrated by creating a Subversion (SVN) repository with malicious hooks, then using svn to trigger execution of those hooks.

### CVSS Score: **8.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
