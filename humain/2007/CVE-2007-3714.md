Directory traversal vulnerability in Ada Image Server (ImgSvr) 0.6.5 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files via a .. (dot dot) in the template parameter to the default URI.  NOTE: the provenance of this information is unknown; the details are obtained solely from third party information.  NOTE: this is probably a different issue than CVE-2004-2464.  NOTE: it was later reported that 0.6.21 and earlier is also affected.
