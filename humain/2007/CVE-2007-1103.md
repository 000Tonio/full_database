- Published: 2007-02-26T17:28:00

Tor does not verify a node's uptime and bandwidth advertisements, which allows remote attackers who operate a low resource node to make false claims of greater resources, which places the node into use for many circuits and compromises the anonymity of traffic sources and destinations.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| --- | --- | --- |
