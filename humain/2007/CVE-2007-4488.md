Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Siemens Gigaset SE361 WLAN router with firmware 1.00.0 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the portion of the URI immediately following the filename for (1) a GIF filename, which triggers display of the GIF file in text format and an unspecified denial of service (crash); or (2) the login.tri filename, which triggers a continuous loop of the browser attempting to visit the login page.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
