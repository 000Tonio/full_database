Heap-based buffer overflow in Kakadu kdu_v32m.dll in Yahoo! Messenger 8.1.0.413 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a certain length field in JPEG2000 data, as demonstrated by sending an "invite to view my webcam" request, and then injecting a DLL into the attacker's peer Yahoo! Messenger application when this request is accepted.
