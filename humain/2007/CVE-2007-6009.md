# CVE-2007-6009

- Published: 2007-11-15T22:46:00

- Modified: 2008-11-15T07:03:00

Multiple buffer overflows in ACD products allow user-assisted remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long section string in a (1) XBM or (2) XPM file to (a) ID_X.apl or (b) IDE_ACDStd.apl.  NOTE: the PSP and LHA vectors are already covered by CVE-2007-4344 and CVE-2007-6007.  NOTE: these might be integer overflows rather than buffer overflows.
