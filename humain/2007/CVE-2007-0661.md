# CVE-2007-0661

Intel Enterprise Southbridge 2 Baseboard Management Controller (BMC), Intel Server Boards 5000XAL, S5000PAL, S5000PSL, S5000XVN, S5000VCL, S5000VSA, SC5400RA, and OEM Firmware for Intel Enterprise Southbridge Baseboard Management Controller before 20070119, when Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) is enabled, allow remote attackers to connect and issue arbitrary IPMI commands, possibly triggering a denial of service. The IPMI configuration does not appear to be the cause, but an extra condition for when it's possible.  This is the reason for medium access complexity.

### CVSS Score: **5.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
