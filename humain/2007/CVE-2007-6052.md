# CVE-2007-6052

- Published: 2007-11-20T20:46:00

- Modified: 2011-03-08T03:01:00

IBM DB2 UDB 9.1 before Fixpak 4 does not properly perform vector aggregation, which might allow attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and DBMS crash), related to an "overflow." NOTE: the vendor description of this issue is too vague to be certain that it is security-related.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
