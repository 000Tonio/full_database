# CVE-2007-6243

- Published: 2007-12-20T01:46:00

- Modified: 2017-09-29T01:29:00

Adobe Flash Player 9.x up to 9.0.48.0, 8.x up to 8.0.35.0, and 7.x up to 7.0.70.0 does not sufficiently restrict the interpretation and usage of cross-domain policy files, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-domain and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
