Certificate Server 7.2 in Red Hat Certificate System (RHCS) does not properly handle new revocations that occur while a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) is being generated, which might prevent certain revoked certificates from appearing on the CRL quickly and allow users with revoked certificates to bypass the intended CRL.
