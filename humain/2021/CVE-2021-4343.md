# CVE-2021-4343

- Published: 2023-06-07T02:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-07T02:44:00

The Unauthenticated Account Creation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Account Creation in versions up to, and including, 1.6.6. This is due to the stm_listing_register AJAX action function being accessible and taking roles unprotected. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to create accounts, even those with administrator privileges.
