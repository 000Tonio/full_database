NVIDIA GeForce Experience, all versions prior to 3.22, contains a vulnerability in GameStream plugins where log files are created using NT/System level permissions, which may lead to code execution, denial of service, or local privilege escalation. The attacker does not have control over the consequence of a modification nor would they be able to leak information as a direct result of the overwrite.
