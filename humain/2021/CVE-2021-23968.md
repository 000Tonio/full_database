If Content Security Policy blocked frame navigation, the full destination of a redirect served in the frame was reported in the violation report; as opposed to the original frame URI. This could be used to leak sensitive information contained in such URIs. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 86, Thunderbird < 78.8, and Firefox ESR < 78.8.
