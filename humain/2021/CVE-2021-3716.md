# CVE-2021-3716

- Published: 2022-03-02T23:15:00

- Modified: 2022-03-09T19:34:00

A flaw was found in nbdkit due to to improperly caching plaintext state across the STARTTLS encryption boundary. A MitM attacker could use this flaw to inject a plaintext NBD_OPT_STRUCTURED_REPLY before proxying everything else a client sends to the server, potentially leading the client to terminate the NBD session. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**
