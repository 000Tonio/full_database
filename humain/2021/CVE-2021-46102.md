# CVE-2021-46102

- Published: 2022-01-27T18:15:00

From version 0.2.14 to 0.2.16 for Solana rBPF, function "relocate" in the file src/elf.rs has an integer overflow bug because the sym.st_value is read directly from ELF file without checking. If the sym.st_value is rather large, an integer overflow is triggered while calculating the variable "addr" via "addr = (sym.st_value + refd_pa) as u64";

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
