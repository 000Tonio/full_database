The Doneren met Mollie plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive Data Exposure in versions up to, and including, 2.8.5 via the dmm_export_donations() function which is called via the admin_post_dmm_export hook due to missing capability checks. This can allow authenticated attackers to extract a CSV file that contains sensitive information about the donors.
