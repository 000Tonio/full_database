The Batch Cat WordPress plugin through 0.3 defines 3 custom AJAX actions, which both require authentication but are available for all roles. As a result, any authenticated user (including simple subscribers) can add/set/delete arbitrary categories to posts.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
