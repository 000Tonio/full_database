An Insecure Permissions issue exists in Gestionale Open 11.00.00. A low privilege account is able to rename the mysqld.exe file located in bin folder and replace with a malicious file that would connect back to an attacking computer giving system level privileges (nt authority\system) due to the service running as Local System. While a low privilege user is unable to restart the service through the application, a restart of the computer triggers the execution of the malicious file. The application also have unquoted service path issues.
