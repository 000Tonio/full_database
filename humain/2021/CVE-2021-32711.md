Shopware is an open source eCommerce platform. Versions prior to 6.3.5.1 may leak of information via Store-API. The vulnerability could only be fixed by changing the API system, which involves a non-backward-compatible change. Only consumers of the Store-API should be affected by this change. We recommend to update to the current version 6.3.5.1. You can get the update to 6.3.5.1 regularly via the Auto-Updater or directly via the download overview. https://www.shopware.com/en/download/#shopware-6 The vulnerability could only be fixed by changing the API system, which involves a non-backward-compatible change.
