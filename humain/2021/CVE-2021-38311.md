In Contiki 3.0, potential nonterminating acknowledgment loops exist in the Telnet service. When the negotiated options are already disabled, servers still respond to DONT and WONT requests with WONT or DONT commands, which may lead to infinite acknowledgment loops, denial of service, and excessive CPU consumption.
