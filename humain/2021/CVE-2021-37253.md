** DISPUTED ** M-Files Web before 20.10.9524.1 allows a denial of service via overlapping ranges (in HTTP requests with crafted Range or Request-Range headers). NOTE: this is disputed because the range behavior is the responsibility of the web server, not the responsibility of the individual web application.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
