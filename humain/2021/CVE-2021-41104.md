ESPHome is a system to control the ESP8266/ESP32. Anyone with web_server enabled and HTTP basic auth configured on version 2021.9.1 or older is vulnerable to an issue in which `web_server` allows over-the-air (OTA) updates without checking user defined basic auth username & password. This issue is patched in version 2021.9.2. As a workaround, one may disable or remove `web_server`.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
