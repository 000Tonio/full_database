Execution unit scheduler contention may lead to a side channel vulnerability found on AMD CPU microarchitectures codenamed “Zen 1”, “Zen 2” and “Zen 3” that use simultaneous multithreading (SMT). By measuring the contention level on scheduler queues an attacker may potentially leak sensitive information.
