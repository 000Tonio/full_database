Couchbase Server before 6.6.3 and 7.x before 7.0.2 stores Sensitive Information in Cleartext. The issue occurs when the cluster manager forwards a HTTP request from the pluggable UI (query workbench etc) to the specific service. In the backtrace, the Basic Auth Header included in the HTTP request, has the "@" user credentials of the node processing the UI request.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
