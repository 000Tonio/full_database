Invalid JPEG XL images using libjxl can cause an out of bounds access on a std::vector<std::vector<T>> when rendering splines. The OOB read access can either lead to a segfault, or rendering splines based on other process memory. It is recommended to upgrade past 0.6.0 or patch with https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl/pull/757
