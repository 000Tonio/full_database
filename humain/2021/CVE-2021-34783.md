A vulnerability in the software-based SSL/TLS message handler of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of SSL/TLS messages when the device performs software-based SSL/TLS decryption. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted SSL/TLS message to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a DoS condition. Note: Datagram TLS (DTLS) messages cannot be used to exploit this vulnerability.
