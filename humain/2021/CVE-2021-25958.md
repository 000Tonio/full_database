In Apache Ofbiz, versions v17.12.01 to v17.12.07 implement a try catch exception to handle errors at multiple locations but leaks out sensitive table info which may aid the attacker for further recon. A user can register with a very long password, but when he tries to login with it an exception occurs.

### CVSS Score: **5**
