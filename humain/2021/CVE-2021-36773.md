uBlock Origin before 1.36.2 and nMatrix before 4.4.9 support an arbitrary depth of parameter nesting for strict blocking, which allows crafted web sites to cause a denial of service (unbounded recursion that can trigger memory consumption and a loss of all blocking functionality).

### CVSS Score: **5**
