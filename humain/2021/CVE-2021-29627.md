In FreeBSD 13.0-STABLE before n245050, 12.2-STABLE before r369525, 13.0-RC4 before p0, and 12.2-RELEASE before p6, listening socket accept filters implementing the accf_create callback incorrectly freed a process supplied argument string. Additional operations on the socket can lead to a double free or use after free.
