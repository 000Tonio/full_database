An issue was discovered in Couchbase Server before 6.0.5, 6.1.x through 6.5.x before 6.5.2, and 6.6.x before 6.6.1. An internal user with administrator privileges, @ns_server, leaks credentials in cleartext in the cbcollect_info.log, debug.log, ns_couchdb.log, indexer.log, and stats.log files. NOTE: updating the product does not automatically address leaks that occurred in the past.
