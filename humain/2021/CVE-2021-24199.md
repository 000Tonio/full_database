The wpDataTables â€“ Tables & Table Charts premium WordPress plugin before 3.4.2 allows a low privilege authenticated user to perform Boolean-based blind SQL Injection in the table list page on the endpoint /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=get_wdtable&table_id=1, on the 'start' HTTP POST parameter. This allows an attacker to access all the data in the database and obtain access to the WordPress application.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |
