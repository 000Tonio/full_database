Combodo iTop is a web based IT Service Management tool. In 3.0.0 beta releases prior to beta6 the `ajax.render.php?operation=wizard_helper` page did not properly escape the user supplied parameters, allowing for a cross site scripting attack vector. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
