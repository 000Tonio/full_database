# CVE-2021-4401

- Published: 2023-07-01T06:15:00

- Modified: 2023-07-01T06:15:00

The Style Kits plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.8.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the update_posts_stylekit() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update style kits for posts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
