wire-ios is the iOS version of Wire, an open-source secure messaging app. wire-ios versions 3.8.0 and earlier have a bug in which a conversation could be incorrectly set to "unverified. This occurs when: - Self user is added to a new conversation - Self user is added to an existing conversation - All the participants in the conversation were previously marked as verified. The vulnerability is patched in wire-ios version 3.8.1. As a workaround, one can unverify & verify a device in the conversation.
