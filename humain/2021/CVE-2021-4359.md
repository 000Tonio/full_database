# CVE-2021-4359

- Published: 2023-06-07T02:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-07T02:44:00

The Frontend File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Post Deletion in versions up to, and including, 18.2. This is due to lacking authentication protections and lacking a security nonce on the wpfm_delete_file AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete any posts and pages on the site.

### CVSS Score: **null**
