# CVE-2021-23355

This affects all versions of package ps-kill. If (attacker-controlled) user input is given to the kill function, it is possible for an attacker to execute arbitrary commands. This is due to use of the child_process exec function without input sanitization in the index.js file. PoC (provided by reporter): var ps_kill = require('ps-kill'); ps_kill.kill('$(touch success)',function(){});
