Nucleus CMS v3.71 is affected by a file upload vulnerability. In this vulnerability, we can use upload to change the upload path to the path without the Htaccess file. Upload an Htaccess file and write it to AddType application / x-httpd-php.jpg. In this way, an attacker can upload a picture with shell, treat it as PHP, execute commands, so as to take down website resources.
