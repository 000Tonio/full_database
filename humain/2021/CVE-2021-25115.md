The WP Photo Album Plus WordPress plugin before 8.0.10 was vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Error log content was handled improperly, therefore any user, even unauthenticated, could cause arbitrary javascript to be executed in the admin panel.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
