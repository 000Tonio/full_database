The wpForo Forum WordPress plugin before 1.9.7 did not validate the redirect_to parameter in the login form of the forum, leading to an open redirect issue after a successful login. Such issue could allow an attacker to induce a user to use a login URL redirecting to a website under their control and being a replica of the legitimate one, asking them to re-enter their credentials (which will then in the attacker hands)
