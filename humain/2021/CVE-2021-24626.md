The Chameleon CSS WordPress plugin through 1.2 does not have any CSRF and capability checks in all its AJAX calls, allowing any authenticated user, such as subscriber to call them and perform unauthorised actions. One of AJAX call, remove_css, also does not sanitise or escape the css_id POST parameter before using it in a SQL statement, leading to a SQL Injection
