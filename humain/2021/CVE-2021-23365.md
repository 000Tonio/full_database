The package github.com/tyktechnologies/tyk-identity-broker before 1.1.1 are vulnerable to Authentication Bypass via the Go XML parser which can cause SAML authentication bypass. This is because the XML parser doesnâ€™t guarantee integrity in the XML round-trip (encoding/decoding XML data).

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
