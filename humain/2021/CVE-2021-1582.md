A vulnerability in the web UI of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) or Cisco Cloud APIC could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to perform a stored cross-site scripting attack on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to improper input validation in the web UI. An authenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious input to the web UI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web-based interface or access sensitive, browser-based information.
