An open redirect vulnerability exists in the /preauth Servlet in Zimbra Collaboration Suite through 9.0. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would need to have obtained a valid zimbra auth token or a valid preauth token. Once the token is obtained, an attacker could redirect a user to any URL via isredirect=1&redirectURL= in conjunction with the token data (e.g., a valid authtoken= value).

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
