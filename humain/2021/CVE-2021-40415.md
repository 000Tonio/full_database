An incorrect default permission vulnerability exists in the cgiserver.cgi cgi_check_ability functionality of reolink RLC-410W v3.0.0.136_20121102. In cgi_check_ability the Format API does not have a specific case, the user permission will default to 7. This will give non-administrative users the possibility to format the SD card and reboot the device.
