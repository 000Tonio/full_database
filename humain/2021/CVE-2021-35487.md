Nokia Broadcast Message Center through 11.1.0 allows an authenticated user to perform a Boolean Blind SQL Injection attack on the endpoint /owui/block/send-receive-updates (for the Manage Alerts page) via the extIdentifier HTTP POST parameter. This allows an attacker to obtain the database user, database name, and database version information, and potentially database data.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
