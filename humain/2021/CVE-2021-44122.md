SPIP 4.0.0 is affected by a Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in ecrire/public/aiguiller.php, ecrire/public/balises.php, ecrire/balise/formulaire_.php. To exploit the vulnerability, a visitor must visit a malicious website which redirects to the SPIP website. It is also possible to combine XSS vulnerabilities in SPIP 4.0.0 to exploit it.
