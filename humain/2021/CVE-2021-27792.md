The request handling functions in web management interface of Brocade Fabric OS versions before v9.0.1a, v8.2.3a, and v7.4.2h do not properly handle malformed user input, resulting in a service crash. An authenticated attacker could use this weakness to cause the FOS HTTP application handler to crash, requiring a reboot.
