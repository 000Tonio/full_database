# CVE-2021-25018

- Published: 2022-02-14T12:15:00

The PPOM for WooCommerce WordPress plugin before 24.0 does not have authorisation and CSRF checks in the ppom_settings_panel_action AJAX action, allowing any authenticated to call it and set arbitrary settings. Furthermore, due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping, it could lead to Stored XSS issues

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
