The package colors after 1.4.0 are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) that was introduced through an infinite loop in the americanFlag module. Unfortunately this appears to have been a purposeful attempt by a maintainer of colors to make the package unusable, other maintainers' controls over this package appear to have been revoked in an attempt to prevent them from fixing the issue. Vulnerable Code js for (let i = 666; i < Infinity; i++;) { Alternative Remediation Suggested * Pin dependancy to 1.4.0
