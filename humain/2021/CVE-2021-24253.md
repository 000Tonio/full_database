# CVE-2021-24253

The Classyfrieds WordPress plugin through 3.8 does not properly check the uploaded file when an authenticated user adds a listing, only checking the content-type in the request. This allows any authenticated user to upload arbitrary PHP files via the Add Listing feature of the plugin, leading to RCE.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |
