Successful exploitation of this vulnerability on Claroty Secure Remote Access (SRA) Site versions 3.0 through 3.2 allows an attacker with local command line interface access to gain the secret key, subsequently allowing them to generate valid session tokens for the web user interface (UI). With access to the web UI an attacker can access assets managed by the SRA installation and could compromise the installation.
