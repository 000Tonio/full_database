** DISPUTED ** PyBitmessage through 0.6.3.2 allows attackers to write screen captures to Potentially Unwanted Directories via a crafted apinotifypath value. NOTE: the discoverer states "security mitigation may not be necessary as there is no evidence yet that these screen intercepts are actually transported away from the local host." NOTE: it is unclear whether there are any common use cases in which apinotifypath is controlled by an attacker.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |
