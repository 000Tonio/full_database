Incorrect calculation of buffer size vulnerability in Peleton TTR01 up to and including PTV55G allows a remote attacker to trigger a Denial of Service attack through the GymKit daemon process by exploiting a heap overflow in the network server handling the Apple GymKit communication. This can lead to an Apple MFI device not being able to authenticate with the Peleton Bike
