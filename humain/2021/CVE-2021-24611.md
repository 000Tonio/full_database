The Keyword Meta WordPress plugin through 3.0 does not sanitise of escape its settings before outputting them back in the page after they are saved, allowing for Cross-Site Scripting issues. Furthermore, it is also lacking any CSRF check, allowing attacker to make a logged in high privilege user save arbitrary setting via a CSRF attack.
