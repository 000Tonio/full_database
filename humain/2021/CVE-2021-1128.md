A vulnerability in the CLI parser of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to view more information than their privileges allow. The vulnerability is due to insufficient application of restrictions during the execution of a specific command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using a specific command at the command line. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive information within the configuration that otherwise might not have been accessible beyond the privileges of the invoking user.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
