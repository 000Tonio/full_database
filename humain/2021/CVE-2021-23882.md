Improper Access Control vulnerability in McAfee Endpoint Security (ENS) for Windows prior to 10.7.0 February 2021 Update allows local administrators to prevent the installation of some ENS files by placing carefully crafted files where ENS will be installed. This is only applicable to clean installations of ENS as the Access Control rules will prevent modification prior to up an upgrade.
