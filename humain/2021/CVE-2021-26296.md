# CVE-2021-26296

- Published: 2021-02-19T09:15:00

- Modified: 2021-06-02T15:15:00

In the default configuration, Apache MyFaces Core versions 2.2.0 to 2.2.13, 2.3.0 to 2.3.7, 2.3-next-M1 to 2.3-next-M4, and 3.0.0-RC1 use cryptographically weak implicit and explicit cross-site request forgery (CSRF) tokens. Due to that limitation, it is possible (although difficult) for an attacker to calculate a future CSRF token value and to use that value to trick a user into executing unwanted actions on an application.

### CVSS Score: **5.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
