The SAP BusinessObjects BI Platform version - 420 allows an attacker, who has basic access to the application, to inject a malicious script while creating a new module document, file, or folder. When another user visits that page, the stored malicious script will execute in their session, hence allowing the attacker to compromise their confidentiality and integrity.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
