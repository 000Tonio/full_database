In OpenEMR, versions 5.0.2 to 6.0.0 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) due to user input not being validated properly and rendered in the U2F USB Device authentication method page. A highly privileged attacker could inject arbitrary code into input fields when creating a new user.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
