A vulnerability in the image verification function of Cisco Expressway Series and Cisco TelePresence Video Communication Server (VCS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute code with internal user privileges on the underlying operating system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the content of upgrade packages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a malicious archive to the Upgrade page of the administrative web interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code with user-level privileges (the _nobody account) on the underlying operating system.

### CVSS Score: **9**
