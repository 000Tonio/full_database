In RPCMS v1.8 and below, the "nickname" variable is not properly sanitized before being displayed on page. When the API functions are enabled, the attacker can use API to update user nickname with XSS payload and achieve stored XSS. Users who view the articles published by the injected user will trigger the XSS.
