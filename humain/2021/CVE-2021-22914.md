Citrix Cloud Connector before 6.31.0.62192 suffers from insecure storage of sensitive information due to sensitive information being stored in the Citrix Cloud Connector installation log files. Such information could be used by an malicious actor to access a Citrix Cloud environment. This issue affects all versions of Citrix Cloud Connector that were installed by passing secure client parameters for installation via the command line. The issue does not affect Citrix Cloud Connector if it was installed using the interactive installer or where a parameter file was used with the command-line installer.
