- Published: 2021-09-07T07:15:00

- Modified: 2021-09-13T17:44:00

The Bluetooth Classic implementation on AB32VG1 devices does not properly handle the reception of continuous unsolicited LMP responses, allowing attackers in radio range to trigger a denial of service (either restart or deadlock the device) by flooding a device with LMP_AU_rand data.
