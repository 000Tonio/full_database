The actionpack ruby gem before 6.1.3.2, 6.0.3.7, 5.2.4.6, 5.2.6 suffers from a possible denial of service vulnerability in the Token Authentication logic in Action Controller due to a too permissive regular expression. Impacted code uses `authenticate_or_request_with_http_token` or `authenticate_with_http_token` for request authentication.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| --- | --- | --- |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
