** DISPUTED ** Python 3.x through 3.10 has an open redirection vulnerability in lib/http/server.py due to no protection against multiple (/) at the beginning of URI path which may leads to information disclosure. NOTE: this is disputed by a third party because the http.server.html documentation page states "Warning: http.server is not recommended for production. It only implements basic security checks."
