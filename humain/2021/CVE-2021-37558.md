A SQL injection vulnerability in a MediaWiki script in Centreon before 20.04.14, 20.10.8, and 21.04.2 allows remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the host_name and service_description parameters. The vulnerability can be exploited only when a valid Knowledge Base URL is configured on the Knowledge Base configuration page and points to a MediaWiki instance. This relates to the proxy feature in class/centreon-knowledge/ProceduresProxy.class.php and include/configuration/configKnowledge/proxy/proxy.php.
