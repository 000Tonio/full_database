# CVE-2021-32030

The administrator application on ASUS GT-AC2900 devices before 3.0.0.4.386.42643 allows authentication bypass when processing remote input from an unauthenticated user, leading to unauthorized access to the administrator interface. This relates to handle_request in router/httpd/httpd.c and auth_check in web_hook.o. An attacker-supplied value of '\0' matches the device's default value of '\0' in some situations.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
