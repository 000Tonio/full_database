In SiCKRAGE, versions 9.3.54.dev1 to 10.0.11.dev1 are vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS) due to user input not being validated properly in the `quicksearch` feature. Therefore, an attacker can steal a user's sessionID to masquerade as a victim user, to carry out any actions in the context of the user.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
