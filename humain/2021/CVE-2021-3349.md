** DISPUTED ** GNOME Evolution through 3.38.3 produces a "Valid signature" message for an unknown identifier on a previously trusted key because Evolution does not retrieve enough information from the GnuPG API. NOTE: third parties dispute the significance of this issue, and dispute whether Evolution is the best place to change this behavior.
