The N5 Upload Form WordPress plugin through 1.0 suffers from an arbitrary file upload issue in page where a Form from the plugin is embed, as any file can be uploaded. The uploaded filename might be hard to guess as it's generated with md5(uniqid(rand())), however, in the case of misconfigured servers with Directory listing enabled, accessing it is trivial.
