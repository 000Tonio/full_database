On BIG-IP versions 15.1.0.4 through 15.1.3, when the Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK)/Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) driver is used with BIG-IP on Amazon Web Services (AWS) systems, undisclosed requests can cause the Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM) to terminate. This is due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-5862. Note: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated.
