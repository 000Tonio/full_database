In Liferay Portal 7.3.0 and earlier, and Liferay DXP 7.0 before fix pack 96, 7.1 before fix pack 18, and 7.2 before fix pack 5, password reset tokens are not invalidated after a user changes their password, which allows remote attackers to change the userâ€™s password via the old password reset token.
