# CVE-2021-25309

- Published: 2021-03-02T01:15:00

The telnet administrator service running on port 650 on Gigaset DX600A v41.00-175 devices does not implement any lockout or throttling functionality. This situation (together with the weak password policy that forces a 4-digit password) allows remote attackers to easily obtain administrative access via brute-force attacks.

### CVSS Score: **5**
