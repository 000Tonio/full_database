# CVE-2021-35942

- Published: 2021-07-22T18:15:00

The wordexp function in the GNU C Library (aka glibc) through 2.33 may crash or read arbitrary memory in parse_param (in posix/wordexp.c) when called with an untrusted, crafted pattern, potentially resulting in a denial of service or disclosure of information. This occurs because atoi was used but strtoul should have been used to ensure correct calculations.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
