The parameters $cache_path, $wp_cache_debug_ip, $wp_super_cache_front_page_text, $cache_scheduled_time, $cached_direct_pages used in the settings of WP Super Cache WordPress plugin before 1.7.3 result in RCE because they allow input of '$' and '\n'. This is due to an incomplete fix of CVE-2021-24209.
