** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** Oracle GlassFish Server 3.1.2.18 and below allows /common/logViewer/logViewer.jsf XSS. A malicious user can cause an administrator user to supply dangerous content to the vulnerable page, which is then reflected back to the user and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to victims. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by the maintainer.
