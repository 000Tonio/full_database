# CVE-2021-3753

- Published: 2022-02-16T19:15:00

- Modified: 2022-12-07T01:58:00

A race problem was seen in the vt_k_ioctl in drivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c in the Linux kernel, which may cause an out of bounds read in vt as the write access to vc_mode is not protected by lock-in vt_ioctl (KDSETMDE). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
