# CVE-2021-3336

- Published: 2021-01-29T05:15:00

DoTls13CertificateVerify in tls13.c in wolfSSL before 4.7.0 does not cease processing for certain anomalous peer behavior (sending an ED22519, ED448, ECC, or RSA signature without the corresponding certificate). The client side is affected because man-in-the-middle attackers can impersonate TLS 1.3 servers.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
