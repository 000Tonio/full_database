The Easy Social Icons plugin <= 3.0.8 for WordPress echoes out the raw value of `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` in its main file. On certain configurations including Apache+modPHP this makes it possible to use it to perform a reflected Cross-Site Scripting attack by injecting malicious code in the request path.
