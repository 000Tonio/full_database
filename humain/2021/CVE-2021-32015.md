In Nuvoton NPCT75x TPM 1.2 firmware 7.4.0.0, a local authenticated malicious user with high privileges could potentially gain unauthorized access to TPM non-volatile memory. NOTE: Upgrading to firmware version 7.4.0.1 will mitigate against the vulnerability, but version 7.4.0.1 is not TCG or Common Criteria (CC) certified. Nuvoton recommends that users apply the NPCT75x TPM 1.2 firmware update.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
