# CVE-2021-36359

OrbiTeam BSCW Classic before 7.4.3 allows exportpdf authenticated remote code execution (RCE) via XML tag injection because reportlab\platypus\paraparser.py (reached via bscw.cgi op=_editfolder.EditFolder) calls eval on attacker-supplied Python code. This is fixed in 5.0.12, 5.1.10, 5.2.4, 7.3.3, and 7.4.3.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**
