# CVE-2021-20317

- Published: 2021-09-27T11:15:00

- Modified: 2022-06-14T11:15:00

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the timerqueue_add function in lib/timerqueue.c. This flaw allows a local attacker with special user privileges to cause a denial of service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.
