An issue was discovered in PrimeKey EJBCA before 7.6.0. The General Purpose Custom Publisher, which is normally run to invoke a local script upon a publishing operation, was still able to run if the System Configuration setting Enable External Script Access was disabled. With this setting disabled it's not possible to create new such publishers, but existing publishers would continue to run.
