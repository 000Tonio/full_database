EmTec ZOC through 8.02.4 allows remote servers to cause a denial of service (Windows GUI hang) by telling the ZOC window to change its title repeatedly at high speed, which results in many SetWindowTextA or SetWindowTextW calls. In other words, it does not implement a usleep or similar delay upon processing a title change.
