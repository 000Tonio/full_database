Total.js framework (npm package total.js) is a framework for Node.js platfrom written in pure JavaScript similar to PHP's Laravel or Python's Django or ASP.NET MVC. In total.js framework before version 3.4.9, calling the utils.set function with user-controlled values leads to code-injection. This can cause a variety of impacts that include arbitrary code execution. This is fixed in version 3.4.9.
