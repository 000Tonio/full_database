# CVE-2021-26929

- Published: 2021-02-14T04:15:00

An XSS issue was discovered in Horde Groupware Webmail Edition through 5.2.22 (where the Horde_Text_Filter library before 2.3.7 is used). The attacker can send a plain text e-mail message, with JavaScript encoded as a link or email that is mishandled by preProcess in Text2html.php, because bespoke use of \x00\x00\x00 and \x01\x01\x01 interferes with XSS defenses.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
