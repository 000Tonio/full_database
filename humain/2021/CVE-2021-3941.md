# CVE-2021-3941

- Published: 2022-03-25T19:15:00

- Modified: 2023-02-03T23:41:00

In ImfChromaticities.cpp routine RGBtoXYZ(), there are some division operations such as `float Z = (1 - chroma.white.x - chroma.white.y) * Y / chroma.white.y;` and `chroma.green.y * (X + Z))) / d;` but the divisor is not checked for a 0 value. A specially crafted file could trigger a divide-by-zero condition which could affect the availability of programs linked with OpenEXR.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
