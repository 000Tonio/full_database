GE UR firmware versions prior to version 8.1x web server task does not properly handle receipt of unsupported HTTP verbs, resulting in the web server becoming temporarily unresponsive after receiving a series of unsupported HTTP requests. When unresponsive, the web server is inaccessible. By itself, this is not particularly significant as the relay remains effective in all other functionality and communication channels.

### CVSS Score: **5**
