An unauthenticated attacker with physical access to a computer with NetSetMan Pro before 5.0 installed, that has the pre-logon profile switch button within the Windows logon screen enabled, is able to drop to an administrative shell and execute arbitrary commands as SYSTEM via the "save log to file" feature. To accomplish this, the attacker can navigate to cmd.exe.
