The Telus Wi-Fi Hub (PRV65B444A-S-TS) with firmware version 3.00.20 is affected by an authenticated command injection vulnerability in multiple parameters passed to tr69_cmd.cgi. A remote attacker connected to the router's LAN and authenticated with a super user account, or using a bypass authentication vulnerability like CVE-2021-20090 could leverage this issue to run commands or gain a shell as root on the target device.
