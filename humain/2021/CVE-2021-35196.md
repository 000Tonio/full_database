** DISPUTED ** Manuskript through 0.12.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted settings.pickle file in a project file, because there is insecure deserialization via the pickle.load() function in settings.py. NOTE: the vendor's position is that the product is not intended for opening an untrusted project file.
