ECOA BAS controller is vulnerable to configuration disclosure when direct object reference is made to the specific files using an HTTP GET request. This will enable the unauthenticated attacker to remotely disclose sensitive information and help her in authentication bypass, privilege escalation and full system access.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
