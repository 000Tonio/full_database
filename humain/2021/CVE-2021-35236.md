The Secure flag is not set in the SSL Cookie of Kiwi Syslog Server 9.7.2 and previous versions. The Secure attribute tells the browser to only send the cookie if the request is being sent over a secure channel such as HTTPS. This will help protect the cookie from being passed over unencrypted requests. If the application can be accessed over both HTTP, there is a potential for the cookie can be sent in clear text.
