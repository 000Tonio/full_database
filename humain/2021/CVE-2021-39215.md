Jitsi Meet is an open source video conferencing application. In versions prior to 2.0.5963, a Prosody module allows the use of symmetrical algorithms to validate JSON web tokens. This means that tokens generated by arbitrary sources can be used to gain authorization to protected rooms. This issue is fixed in Jitsi Meet 2.0.5963. There are no known workarounds aside from updating.
