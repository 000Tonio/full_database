raspap-webgui in RaspAP 2.6.6 allows attackers to execute commands as root because of the insecure sudoers permissions. The www-data account can execute /etc/raspap/hostapd/enablelog.sh as root with no password; however, the www-data account can also overwrite /etc/raspap/hostapd/enablelog.sh with any executable content.

### CVSS Score: **9**
