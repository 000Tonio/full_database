# CVE-2021-25087

- Published: 2022-03-07T09:15:00

- Modified: 2022-04-12T15:55:00

The Download Manager WordPress plugin before 3.2.35 does not have any authorisation checks in some of the REST API endpoints, allowing unauthenticated attackers to call them, which could lead to sensitive information disclosure, such as posts passwords (fixed in 3.2.24) and files Master Keys (fixed in 3.2.25).

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
