A stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was identified in Apperta Foundation OpenEyes 3.5.1. Updating a patient's details allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the Address1 parameter. This JavaScript then executes when the patient profile is loaded, which could be used in a XSS attack.
