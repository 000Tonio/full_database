SAP's HCM Travel Management Fiori Apps V2, version - 608, does not perform proper authorization check, allowing an authenticated but unauthorized attacker to read personnel numbers of employees, resulting in escalation of privileges. However, the attacker can only read some information like last name, first name of the employees, so there is some loss of confidential information, Integrity and Availability are not impacted.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
