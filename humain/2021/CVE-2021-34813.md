Matrix libolm before 3.2.3 allows a malicious Matrix homeserver to crash a client (while it is attempting to retrieve an Olm encrypted room key backup from the homeserver) because olm_pk_decrypt has a stack-based buffer overflow. Remote code execution might be possible for some nonstandard build configurations.
