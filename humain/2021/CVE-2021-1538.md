A vulnerability in the configuration dashboard of Cisco Common Services Platform Collector (CSPC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of configuration entries. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in as a super admin and entering crafted input to configuration options on the CSPC configuration dashboard. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute remote code as root.
