# CVE-2021-23340

This affects the package pimcore/pimcore before 6.8.8. A Local FIle Inclusion vulnerability exists in the downloadCsvAction function of the CustomReportController class (bundles/AdminBundle/Controller/Reports/CustomReportController.php). An authenticated user can reach this function with a GET request at the following endpoint: /admin/reports/custom-report/download-csv?exportFile=&91;filename]. Since exportFile variable is not sanitized, an attacker can exploit a local file inclusion vulnerability.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
