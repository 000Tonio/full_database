Anuko Time Tracker is an open source, web-based time tracking application written in PHP. In Time Tracker before version 1.19.27.5431 a Cross site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability existed. The nature of CSRF is that a logged on user may be tricked by social engineering to click on an attacker-provided form that executes an unintended action such as changing user password. The vulnerability is fixed in Time Tracker version 1.19.27.5431. Upgrade is recommended. If upgrade is not practical, introduce ttMitigateCSRF() function in /WEB-INF/lib/common.php.lib using the latest available code and call it from ttAccessAllowed().
