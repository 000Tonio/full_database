# CVE-2021-4028

- Published: 2022-08-24T16:15:00

- Modified: 2023-02-10T16:18:00

A flaw in the Linux kernel's implementation of RDMA communications manager listener code allowed an attacker with local access to setup a socket to listen on a high port allowing for a list element to be used after free. Given the ability to execute code, a local attacker could leverage this use-after-free to crash the system or possibly escalate privileges on the system.
