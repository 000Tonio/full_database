In Requarks wiki.js, versions 2.0.0-beta.147 to 2.5.255 are affected by Stored XSS vulnerability, where a low privileged (editor) user can upload a SVG file that contains malicious JavaScript while uploading assets in the page. That will send the JWT tokens to the attackerâ€™s server and will lead to account takeover when accessed by the victim.
