In OpenNMS Horizon, versions opennms-1-0-stable through opennms-27.1.0-1; OpenNMS Meridian, versions meridian-foundation-2015.1.0-1 through meridian-foundation-2019.1.18-1; meridian-foundation-2020.1.0-1 through meridian-foundation-2020.1.6-1 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting since there is no validation on the input being sent to the `name` parameter in `noticeWizard` endpoint. Due to this flaw an authenticated attacker could inject arbitrary script and trick other admin users into downloading malicious files.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
