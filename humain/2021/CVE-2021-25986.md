In Django-wiki, versions 0.0.20 to 0.7.8 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Notifications Section. An attacker who has access to edit pages can inject JavaScript payload in the title field. When a victim gets a notification regarding the changes made in the application, the payload in the notification panel renders and loads external JavaScript.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
