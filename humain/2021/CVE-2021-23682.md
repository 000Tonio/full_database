This affects the package litespeed.js before 0.3.12; the package appwrite/server-ce from 0.12.0 and before 0.12.2, before 0.11.1. When parsing the query string in the getJsonFromUrl function, the key that is set in the result object is not properly sanitized leading to a Prototype Pollution vulnerability.
