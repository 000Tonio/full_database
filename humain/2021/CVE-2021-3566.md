# CVE-2021-3566

- Published: 2021-08-05T21:15:00

Prior to ffmpeg version 4.3, the tty demuxer did not have a 'read_probe' function assigned to it. By crafting a legitimate "ffconcat" file that references an image, followed by a file the triggers the tty demuxer, the contents of the second file will be copied into the output file verbatim (as long as the `-vcodec copy` option is passed to ffmpeg).

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
