PHP Event Calendar before 2021-09-03 allows SQL injection, as demonstrated by the /server/ajax/user_manager.php username parameter. This can be used to execute SQL statements directly on the database, allowing an adversary in some cases to completely compromise the database system. It can also be used to bypass the login form.
