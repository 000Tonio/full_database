An issue was discovered in CrushFTP 9. The creation of a new user through the /WebInterface/UserManager/ interface allows an attacker, with access to the administration panel, to perform Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The payload can be executed in multiple scenarios, for example when the user's page appears in the Most Visited section of the page.
