ShowMyPC 3606 on Windows suffers from a DLL hijack vulnerability. If an attacker overwrites the file %temp%\ShowMyPC\-ShowMyPC3606\wodVPN.dll, it will run any malicious code contained in that file. The code will run with normal user privileges unless the user specifically runs ShowMyPC as administrator.
