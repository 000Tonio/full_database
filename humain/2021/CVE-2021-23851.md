A specially crafted TCP/IP packet may cause the camera recovery image web interface to crash. It may also cause a buffer overflow which could enable remote code execution. The recovery image can only be booted with administrative rights or with physical access to the camera and allows the upload of a new firmware in case of a damaged firmware.
