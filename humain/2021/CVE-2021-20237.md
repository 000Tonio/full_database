An uncontrolled resource consumption (memory leak) flaw was found in ZeroMQ's src/xpub.cpp in versions before 4.3.3. This flaw allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to send crafted PUB messages that consume excessive memory if the CURVE/ZAP authentication is disabled on the server, causing a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
