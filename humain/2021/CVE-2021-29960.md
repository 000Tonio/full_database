Firefox used to cache the last filename used for printing a file. When generating a filename for printing, Firefox usually suggests the web page title. The caching and suggestion techniques combined may have lead to the title of a website visited during private browsing mode being stored on disk. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 89.
