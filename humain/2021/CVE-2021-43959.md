Affected versions of Atlassian Jira Service Management Server and Data Center allow authenticated remote attackers to access the content of internal network resources via a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the CSV importing feature of JSM Insight. When running in an environment like Amazon EC2, this flaw may be used to access to a metadata resource that provides access credentials and other potentially confidential information. The affected versions are before version 4.13.20, from version 4.14.0 before 4.20.8, and from version 4.21.0 before 4.22.2.

### CVSS Score: **null**
