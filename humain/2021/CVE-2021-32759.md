OpenMage magento-lts is an alternative to the Magento CE official releases. Due to missing sanitation in data flow in versions prior to 19.4.15 and 20.0.13, it was possible for admin users to upload arbitrary executable files to the server. OpenMage versions 19.4.15 and 20.0.13 have a patch for this Issue.
