# CVE-2021-4041

- Published: 2022-08-24T16:15:00

- Modified: 2022-08-29T14:30:00

A flaw was found in ansible-runner. An improper escaping of the shell command, while calling the ansible_runner.interface.run_command, can lead to parameters getting executed as host's shell command. A developer could unintentionally write code that gets executed in the host rather than the virtual environment.
