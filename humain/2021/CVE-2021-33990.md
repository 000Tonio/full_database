** DISPUTED ** Liferay Portal 6.2.5 allows Command=FileUpload&Type=File&CurrentFolder=/ requests when frmfolders.html exists. NOTE: The vendor disputes this issue because the exploit reference link only shows frmfolders.html is accessible and does not demonstrate how an unauthorized user can upload a file.
