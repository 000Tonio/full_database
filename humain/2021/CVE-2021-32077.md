Primary Source Verification in VerityStream MSOW Solutions before 3.1.1 allows an anonymous internet user to discover Social Security Number (SSN) values via a brute-force attack on a (sometimes hidden) search field, because the last four SSN digits are part of the supported combination of search selectors. This discloses doctors' and nurses' social security numbers and PII.

### CVSS Score: **5**
