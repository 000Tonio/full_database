The password parameter on Simple Online Mens Salon Management System (MSMS) 1.0 appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection attacks through the password parameter. The predictive tests of this application interacted with that domain, indicating that the injected SQL query was executed. The attacker can retrieve all authentication and information about the users of this system.

### CVSS Score: **5**
