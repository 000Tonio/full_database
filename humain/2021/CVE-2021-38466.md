InHand Networks IR615 Router's Versions 2.3.0.r4724 and 2.3.0.r4870 do not perform sufficient input validation on client requests from the help page. This may allow an attacker to perform a reflected cross-site scripting attack, which could allow an attacker to run code on behalf of the client browser.
