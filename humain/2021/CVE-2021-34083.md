Google-it is a Node.js package which allows its users to send search queries to Google and receive the results in a JSON format. When using the 'Open in browser' option in versions up to 1.6.2, google-it will unsafely concat the result's link retrieved from google to a shell command, potentially exposing the server to RCE.
