An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in routing process daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS devices configured with BGP origin validation using Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI), allows an attacker to send a specific BGP update which may cause RPKI policy-checks to be bypassed. This, in turn, may allow a spoofed advertisement to be accepted or propagated. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S18; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S9; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R3-S3; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S7; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S9, 17.4R3; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S13; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R3-S3; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S1; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R3; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R2; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R2; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2.
