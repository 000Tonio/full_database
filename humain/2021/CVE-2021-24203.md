In the Elementor Website Builder WordPress plugin before 3.1.4, the divider widget (includes/widgets/divider.php) accepts an ‘html_tag’ parameter. Although the element control lists a fixed set of possible html tags, it is possible for a user with Contributor or above permissions to send a modified ‘save_builder’ request with this parameter set to ‘script’ and combined with a ‘text’ parameter containing JavaScript, which will then be executed when the saved page is viewed or previewed.
