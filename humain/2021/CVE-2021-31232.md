The Alertmanager in CNCF Cortex before 1.8.1 has a local file disclosure vulnerability when -experimental.alertmanager.enable-api is used. The HTTP basic auth password_file can be used as an attack vector to send any file content via a webhook. The alertmanager templates can be used as an attack vector to send any file content because the alertmanager can load any text file specified in the templates list.
