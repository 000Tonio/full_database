# CVE-2021-23434

This affects the package object-path before 0.11.6. A type confusion vulnerability can lead to a bypass of CVE-2020-15256 when the path components used in the path parameter are arrays. In particular, the condition currentPath === '__proto__' returns false if currentPath is ['__proto__']. This is because the === operator returns always false when the type of the operands is different.
