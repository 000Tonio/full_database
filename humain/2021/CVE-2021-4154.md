A use-after-free flaw was found in cgroup1_parse_param in kernel/cgroup/cgroup-v1.c in the Linux kernel's cgroup v1 parser. A local attacker with a user privilege could cause a privilege escalation by exploiting the fsconfig syscall parameter leading to a container breakout and a denial of service on the system.
