Vapor is a web framework for Swift. In versions 4.47.1 and prior, bug in the `Data.init(base32Encoded:)` function opens up the potential for exposing server memory and/or crashing the server (Denial of Service) for applications where untrusted data can end up in said function. Vapor does not currently use this function itself so this only impact applications that use the impacted function directly or through other dependencies. The vulnerability is patched in version 4.47.2. As a workaround, one may use an alternative to Vapor's built-in `Data.init(base32Encoded:)`.
