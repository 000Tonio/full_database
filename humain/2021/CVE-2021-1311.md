A vulnerability in the reclaim host role feature of Cisco Webex Meetings and Cisco Webex Meetings Server could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to take over the host role during a meeting. This vulnerability is due to a lack of protection against brute forcing of the host key. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to a vulnerable Cisco Webex Meetings or Webex Meetings Server site. A successful exploit would require the attacker to have access to join a Webex meeting, including applicable meeting join links and passwords. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to acquire or take over the host role for a meeting.
