# CVE-2021-24556

- Published: 2021-08-23T12:15:00

The kento_email_subscriber_ajax AJAX action of the Email Subscriber WordPress plugin through 1.1, does not properly sanitise, validate and escape the submitted subscribe_email and subscribe_name POST parameters, inserting them in the DB and then outputting them back in the Subscriber list (/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=kes_campaign&page=kento_email_subscriber_list_settings), leading a Stored XSS issue.
