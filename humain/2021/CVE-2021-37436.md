Amazon Echo Dot devices through 2021-07-02 sometimes allow attackers, who have physical access to a device after a factory reset, to obtain sensitive information via a series of complex hardware and software attacks. NOTE: reportedly, there were vendor marketing statements about safely removing personal content via a factory reset. Also, the vendor has reportedly indicated that they are working on mitigations.
