# CVE-2021-26720

- Published: 2021-02-17T22:15:00

- Modified: 2022-12-06T21:52:00

avahi-daemon-check-dns.sh in the Debian avahi package through 0.8-4 is executed as root via /etc/network/if-up.d/avahi-daemon, and allows a local attacker to cause a denial of service or create arbitrary empty files via a symlink attack on files under /run/avahi-daemon. NOTE: this only affects the packaging for Debian GNU/Linux (used indirectly by SUSE), not the upstream Avahi product.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
