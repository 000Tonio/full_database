# CVE-2021-24911

- Published: 2022-08-22T15:15:00

The Transposh WordPress Translation WordPress plugin before 1.0.8 does not sanitise and escape the tk0 parameter from the tp_translation AJAX action, leading to Stored Cross-Site Scripting, which will trigger in the admin dashboard of the plugin. The minimum role needed to perform such attack depends on the plugin "Who can translate ?" setting.
