The TRENDnet TI-PG1284i switch(hw v2.0R) prior to version 2.0.2.S0 suffers from a null pointer dereference vulnerability. This vulnerability exists in its lldp related component. Due to fail to check if ChassisID TLV is contained in the packet, by sending a crafted lldp packet to the device, an attacker can crash the process due to null pointer dereference.
