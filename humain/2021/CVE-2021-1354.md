A vulnerability in the certificate registration process of Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) Central Software could allow an authenticated, adjacent attacker to register a rogue Cisco Unified Computing System Manager (UCSM). This vulnerability is due to improper certificate validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the registration API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to register a rogue Cisco UCSM and gain access to Cisco UCS Central Software data and Cisco UCSM inventory data.
