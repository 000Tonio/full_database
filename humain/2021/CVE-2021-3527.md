# CVE-2021-3527

- Published: 2021-05-26T22:15:00

- Modified: 2022-09-05T06:15:00

A flaw was found in the USB redirector device (usb-redir) of QEMU. Small USB packets are combined into a single, large transfer request, to reduce the overhead and improve performance. The combined size of the bulk transfer is used to dynamically allocate a variable length array (VLA) on the stack without proper validation. Since the total size is not bounded, a malicious guest could use this flaw to influence the array length and cause the QEMU process to perform an excessive allocation on the stack, resulting in a denial of service.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
