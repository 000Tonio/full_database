The IP2Location Country Blocker WordPress plugin before 2.26.5 does not have authorisation and CSRF checks in the ip2location_country_blocker_save_rules AJAX action, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscriber to call it and block arbitrary country, or block all of them at once, preventing users from accessing the frontend.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
