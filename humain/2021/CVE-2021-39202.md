WordPress is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with a MySQL or MariaDB database. In affected versions the widgets editor introduced in WordPress 5.8 beta 1 has improper handling of HTML input in the Custom HTML feature. This leads to stored XSS in the custom HTML widget. This has been patched in WordPress 5.8. It was only present during the testing/beta phase of WordPress 5.8.
