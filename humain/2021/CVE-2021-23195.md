Fresenius Kabi Vigilant Software Suite (Mastermed Dashboard) version 2.0.1.3 has the option for automated indexing (directory listing) activated. When accessing a directory, a web server delivers its entire content in HTML form. If an index file does not exist and directory listing is enabled, all content of the directory will be displayed, allowing an attacker to identify and access files on the server.
