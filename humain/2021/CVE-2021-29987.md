After requesting multiple permissions, and closing the first permission panel, subsequent permission panels will be displayed in a different position but still record a click in the default location, making it possible to trick a user into accepting a permission they did not want to. *This bug only affects Firefox on Linux. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 91 and Thunderbird < 91.
