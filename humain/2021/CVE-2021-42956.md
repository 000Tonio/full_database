Zoho Remote Access Plus Server Windows Desktop Binary fixed in 10.1.2132.6 is affected by a sensitive information disclosure vulnerability. Due to improper privilege management, the process launches as the logged in user, so memory dump can be done by non-admin also. Remotely, an attacker can dump all sensitive information including DB Connection string, entire IT infrastructure details, commands executed by IT admin including credentials, secrets, private keys and more.
