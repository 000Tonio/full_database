A DLL sideloading vulnerability in McAfee Agent for Windows prior to 5.7.4 could allow a local user to perform a DLL sideloading attack with an unsigned DLL with a specific name and in a specific location. This would result in the user gaining elevated permissions and the ability to execute arbitrary code as the system user, through not checking the DLL signature.
