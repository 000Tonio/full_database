A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco Prime Infrastructure and Cisco Evolved Programmable Network (EPN) Manager could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access sensitive information stored on the underlying file system of an affected system. This vulnerability exists because sensitive information is not sufficiently secured when it is stored. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information on an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to create forged authentication requests and gain unauthorized access to the affected system.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
