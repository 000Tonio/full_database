A security vulnerability originally reported in the SYNC2101 product, and applicable to specific sub-families of SYNC devices, allows an attacker to download the configuration file used in the device and apply a modified configuration file back to the device. The attack requires network access to the SYNC device and knowledge of its IP address. The attack exploits the unsecured communication channel used between the administration tool Easyconnect and the SYNC device (in the affected family of SYNC products).
