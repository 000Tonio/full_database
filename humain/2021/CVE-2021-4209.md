# CVE-2021-4209

- Published: 2022-08-24T16:15:00

- Modified: 2022-10-27T16:57:00

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in GnuTLS. As Nettle's hash update functions internally call memcpy, providing zero-length input may cause undefined behavior. This flaw leads to a denial of service after authentication in rare circumstances.
