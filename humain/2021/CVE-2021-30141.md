** DISPUTED ** Module/Settings/UserExport.php in Friendica through 2021.01 allows settings/userexport to be used by anonymous users, as demonstrated by an attempted access to an array offset on a value of type null, and excessive memory consumption. NOTE: the vendor states "the feature still requires a valid authentication cookie even if the route is accessible to non-logged users."

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
