A ZTE's product of the transport network access layer has a security vulnerability. Because the system does not sufficiently verify the data reliability, attackers could replace an authenticated optical module on the equipment with an unauthenticated one, bypassing system authentication and detection, thus affecting signal transmission. This affects: <ZXCTN 6120H><V5.10.00B24>

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
