# CVE-2021-4364

- Published: 2023-06-07T02:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-07T02:44:00

The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the jobsearch_add_job_import_schedule_call() function in versions up to, and including, 1.8.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to add and/or modify schedule calls.
