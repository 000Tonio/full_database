The Ibtana WordPress plugin before 1.1.4.9 does not have authorisation and CSRF checks in the ive_save_general_settings AJAX action, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscriber to call it and change the plugin's settings which could lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue.

| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
