prog.cgi on D-Link DIR-3060 devices before 1.11b04 HF2 allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary commands in an admin or root context because SetVirtualServerSettings calls CheckArpTables, which calls popen unsafely.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
