** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** EMQ X Dashboard V3.0.0 is affected by username enumeration in the "/api /v3/auth" interface. When a user login, the application returns different results depending on whether the account is correct, that allowed an attacker to determine if a given username was valid.

### CVSS Score: **5**
