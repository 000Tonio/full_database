Mahara 20.10 is affected by Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) that allows a remote attacker to remove inbox-mail on the server. The application fails to validate the CSRF token for a POST request. An attacker can craft a module/multirecipientnotification/inbox.php pieform_delete_all_notifications request, which leads to removing all messages from a mailbox.
