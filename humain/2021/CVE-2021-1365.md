Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Communications Manager IM &amp; Presence Service could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct SQL injection attacks on an affected system. These vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-submitted parameters. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by authenticating to the application and sending malicious requests to an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain data or modify data that is stored in the underlying database.
