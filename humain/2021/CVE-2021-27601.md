SAP NetWeaver AS Java (Applications based on HTMLB for Java) allows a basic-level authorized attacker to store a malicious file on the server. When a victim tries to open this file, it results in a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability and the attacker can read and modify data. However, the attacker does not have control over kind or degree.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**
