UploadService in Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Business Analytics through 9.1 does not properly verify uploaded user files, which allows an authenticated user to upload various files of different file types. Specifically, a .jsp file is not allowed, but a .jsp. file is allowed (and leads to remote code execution).

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
