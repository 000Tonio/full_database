CourseMS (aka Course Registration Management System) 2.1 is affected by cross-site scripting (XSS). When an attacker with access to an Admin account creates a Job Title in the Site area (aka the admin/add_jobs.php name parameter), they can insert an XSS payload. This payload will execute whenever anyone visits the registration page.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**
