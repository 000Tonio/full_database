# CVE-2021-41861

The Telegram application 7.5.0 through 7.8.0 for Android does not properly implement image self-destruction, a different vulnerability than CVE-2019-16248. After approximately two to four uses of the self-destruct feature, there is a misleading UI indication that an image was deleted (on both the sender and recipient sides). The images are still present in the /Storage/Emulated/0/Telegram/Telegram Image/ directory.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
