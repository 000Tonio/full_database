This affects the package putil-merge before 3.8.0. The merge() function does not check the values passed into the argument. An attacker can supply a malicious value by adjusting the value to include the constructor property. Note: This vulnerability derives from an incomplete fix in https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-PUTILMERGE-1317077
