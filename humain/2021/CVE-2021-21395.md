Magneto LTS (Long Term Support) is a community developed alternative to the Magento CE official releases. Versions prior to 19.4.22 and 20.0.19 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery. The password reset form is vulnerable to CSRF between the time the reset password link is clicked and user submits new password. This issue is patched in versions 19.4.22 and 20.0.19. There are no workarounds.
