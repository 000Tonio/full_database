An incorrect default permission vulnerability exists in the cgiserver.cgi cgi_check_ability functionality of reolink RLC-410W v3.0.0.136_20121102. The UpgradePrepare is the API that checks if a provided filename identifies a new version of the RLC-410W firmware. If the version is new, it would be possible, allegedly, to later on perform the Upgrade. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.
