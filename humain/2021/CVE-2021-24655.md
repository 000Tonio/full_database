The WP User Manager WordPress plugin before 2.6.3 does not ensure that the user ID to reset the password of is related to the reset key given. As a result, any authenticated user can reset the password (to an arbitrary value) of any user knowing only their ID, and gain access to their account.

### CVSS Score: **6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
