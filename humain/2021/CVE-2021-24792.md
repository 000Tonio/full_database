The Shiny Buttons WordPress plugin through 1.1.0 does not have any authorisation and CSRF in place when saving a template (wpbtn_save_template function hooked to the init action), nor sanitise and escape them before outputting them in the admin dashboard, which allow unauthenticated users to add a malicious template and lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting issues.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
