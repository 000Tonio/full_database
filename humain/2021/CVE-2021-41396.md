# CVE-2021-41396

- Published: 2022-07-12T14:15:00

- Modified: 2022-07-18T18:59:00

Live555 through 1.08 does not handle socket connections properly. A huge number of incoming socket connections in a short time invokes the error-handling module, in which a heap-based buffer overflow happens. An attacker can leverage this to launch a DoS attack.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
