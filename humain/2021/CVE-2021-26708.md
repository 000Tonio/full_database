# CVE-2021-26708

- Published: 2021-02-05T14:15:00

- Modified: 2022-02-25T19:07:00

A local privilege escalation was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.10.13. Multiple race conditions in the AF_VSOCK implementation are caused by wrong locking in net/vmw_vsock/af_vsock.c. The race conditions were implicitly introduced in the commits that added VSOCK multi-transport support.
