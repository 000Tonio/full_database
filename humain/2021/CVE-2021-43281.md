MyBB before 1.8.29 allows Remote Code Injection by an admin with the "Can manage settings?" permission. The Admin CP's Settings management module does not validate setting types correctly on insertion and update, making it possible to add settings of supported type "php" with PHP code, executed on Change Settings pages.
