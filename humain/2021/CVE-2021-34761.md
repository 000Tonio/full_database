A vulnerability in Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite or append arbitrary data to system files using root-level privileges. The attacker must have administrative credentials on the device. This vulnerability is due to incomplete validation of user input for a specific CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device with administrative privileges and issuing a CLI command with crafted user parameters. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite or append arbitrary data to system files using root-level privileges.

### CVSS Score: **6.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |
