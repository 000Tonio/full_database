In onCreate of CompanionDeviceActivity.java or DeviceChooserActivity.java, there is a possible way for HTML tags to interfere with a consent dialog due to improper input validation. This could lead to remote escalation of privilege, confusing the user into accepting pairing of a malicious Bluetooth device, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation.Product: AndroidVersions: Android-10 Android-11 Android-12 Android-9Android ID: A-172251622
