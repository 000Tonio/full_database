# CVE-2021-4346

- Published: 2023-06-07T02:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-07T02:44:00

The uListing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Unauthenticated Arbitrary Account Changes in versions up to, and including, 1.6.6. This is due to missing login checks on the stm_listing_profile_edit AJAX action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to edit any account on the blog, such as changing the admin account's email address.
