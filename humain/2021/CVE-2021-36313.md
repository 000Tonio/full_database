Dell EMC CloudLink 7.1 and all prior versions contain an OS command injection Vulnerability. A remote high privileged attacker, may potentially exploit this vulnerability, leading to the execution of arbitrary OS commands on the application's underlying OS, with the privileges of the vulnerable application. Exploitation may lead to a system take over by an attacker. This vulnerability is considered critical as it may be leveraged to completely compromise the vulnerable application as well as the underlying operating system. Dell recommends customers to upgrade at the earliest opportunity.
