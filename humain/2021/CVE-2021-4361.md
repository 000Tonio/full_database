The JobSearch WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the jobsearch_job_integrations_settin_save AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 1.8.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers to update arbitrary options on the site.
