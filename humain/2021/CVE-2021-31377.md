An Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource vulnerability of a certain file in the filesystem of Junos OS allows a local authenticated attacker to cause routing process daemon (RPD) to crash and restart, causing a Denial of Service (DoS). Repeated actions by the attacker will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
