# CVE-2021-1287

- Published: 2021-03-18T19:15:00

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco RV132W ADSL2+ Wireless-N VPN Routers and Cisco RV134W VDSL2 Wireless-AC VPN Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on an affected device or cause the device to restart unexpectedly. The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system or cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device.

### CVSS Score: **9**
