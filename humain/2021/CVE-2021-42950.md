Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability exists in Zepl Notebooks all previous versions before October 25 2021. Users can register for an account and are allocated a set number of credits to try the product. Once users authenticate, they can proceed to create a new organization by which additional users can be added for various collaboration abilities, which allows malicious user to create new Zepl Notebooks with various languages, contexts, and deployment scenarios. Upon creating a new notebook with specially crafted malicious code, a user can then launch remote code execution.
