# CVE-2021-45083

- Published: 2022-02-20T18:15:00

An issue was discovered in Cobbler before 3.3.1. Files in /etc/cobbler are world readable. Two of those files contain some sensitive information that can be exposed to a local user who has non-privileged access to the server. The users.digest file contains the sha2-512 digest of users in a Cobbler local installation. In the case of an easy-to-guess password, it's trivial to obtain the plaintext string. The settings.yaml file contains secrets such as the hashed default password.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
