# CVE-2021-41991

- Published: 2021-10-18T14:15:00

- Modified: 2022-04-12T18:42:00

The in-memory certificate cache in strongSwan before 5.9.4 has a remote integer overflow upon receiving many requests with different certificates to fill the cache and later trigger the replacement of cache entries. The code attempts to select a less-often-used cache entry by means of a random number generator, but this is not done correctly. Remote code execution might be a slight possibility.

### CVSS Score: **5**
