SAP Business One - version 10.0, allows an admin user to view DB password in plain text over the network, which should otherwise be encrypted. For an attacker to discover vulnerable function in-depth application knowledge is required, but once exploited the attacker may be able to completely compromise confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application.
