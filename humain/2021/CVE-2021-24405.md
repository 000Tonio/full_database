# CVE-2021-24405

The Easy Cookies Policy WordPress plugin through 1.6.2 is lacking any capability and CSRF check when saving its settings, allowing any authenticated users (such as subscriber) to change them. If users can't register, this can be done through CSRF. Furthermore, the cookie banner setting is not sanitised or validated before being output in all pages of the frontend and the backend settings one, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
