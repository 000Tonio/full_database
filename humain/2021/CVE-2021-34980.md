This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NETGEAR R6260 1.1.0.78_1.0.1 routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the setupwizard.cgi page. When parsing the SOAP_LOGIN_TOKEN environment variable, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root. Was ZDI-CAN-14107.
