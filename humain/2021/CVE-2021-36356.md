# CVE-2021-36356

- Published: 2021-08-31T04:15:00

KRAMER VIAware through August 2021 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because ajaxPages/writeBrowseFilePathAjax.php accepts arbitrary executable pathnames (even though browseSystemFiles.php is no longer reachable via the GUI). NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2019-17124.
