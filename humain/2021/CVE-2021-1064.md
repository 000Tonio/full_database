NVIDIA vGPU manager contains a vulnerability in the vGPU plugin, in which it obtains a value from an untrusted source, converts this value to a pointer, and dereferences the resulting pointer, which may lead to information disclosure or denial of service. This affects vGPU version 8.x (prior to 8.6) and version 11.0 (prior to 11.3).
