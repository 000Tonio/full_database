# CVE-2021-34557

- Published: 2021-06-10T16:15:00

- Modified: 2021-09-21T16:39:00

XScreenSaver 5.45 can be bypassed if the machine has more than ten disconnectable video outputs. A buffer overflow in update_screen_layout() allows an attacker to bypass the standard screen lock authentication mechanism by crashing XScreenSaver. The attacker must physically disconnect many video outputs.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
