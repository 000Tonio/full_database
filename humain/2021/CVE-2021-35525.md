# CVE-2021-35525

- Published: 2021-06-28T18:15:00

PostSRSd before 1.11 allows a denial of service (subprocess hang) if Postfix sends certain long data fields such as multiple concatenated email addresses. NOTE: the PostSRSd maintainer acknowledges "theoretically, this error should never occur ... I'm not sure if there's a reliable way to trigger this condition by an external attacker, but it is a security bug in PostSRSd nevertheless."
