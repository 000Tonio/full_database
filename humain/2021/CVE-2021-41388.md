Netskope client prior to 89.x on macOS is impacted by a local privilege escalation vulnerability. The XPC implementation of nsAuxiliarySvc process does not perform validation on new connections before accepting the connection. Thus any low privileged user can connect and call external methods defined in XPC service as root, elevating their privilege to the highest level.
