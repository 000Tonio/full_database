A link following denial-of-service vulnerability in Trend Micro Worry-Free Business Security (on prem only) could allow a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files in the context of SYSTEM. This is similar to, but not the same as CVE-2021-44024. Please note: an attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.
