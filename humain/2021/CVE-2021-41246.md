Express OpenID Connect is express JS middleware implementing sign on for Express web apps using OpenID Connect. Versions before and including `2.5.1` do not regenerate the session id and session cookie when user logs in. This behavior opens up the application to various session fixation vulnerabilities. Versions `2.5.2` contains a patch for this issue.
