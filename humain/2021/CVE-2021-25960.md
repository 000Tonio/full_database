In “SuiteCRM” application, v7.11.18 through v7.11.19 and v7.10.29 through v7.10.31 are affected by “CSV Injection” vulnerability (Formula Injection). A low privileged attacker can use accounts module to inject payloads in the input fields. When an administrator access accounts module to export the data as a CSV file and opens it, the payload gets executed. This was not fixed properly as part of CVE-2020-15301, allowing the attacker to bypass the security measure.
