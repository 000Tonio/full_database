# CVE-2021-43564

- Published: 2021-11-10T16:15:00

- Modified: 2021-11-16T16:28:00

An issue was discovered in the jobfair (aka Job Fair) extension before 1.0.13 and 2.x before 2.0.2 for TYPO3. The extension fails to protect or obfuscate filenames of uploaded files. This allows unauthenticated users to download files with sensitive data by simply guessing the filename of uploaded files (e.g., uploads/tx_jobfair/cv.pdf).

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
