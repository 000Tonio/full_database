# CVE-2021-24988

- Published: 2021-12-27T11:15:00

The WP RSS Aggregator WordPress plugin before 4.19.3 does not sanitise and escape data before outputting it in the System Info admin dashboard, which could lead to a Stored XSS issue due to the wprss_dismiss_addon_notice AJAX action missing authorisation and CSRF checks, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscriber to call it and set a malicious payload in the addon parameter.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
