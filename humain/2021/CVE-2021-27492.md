# CVE-2021-27492

- Published: 2021-05-27T16:15:00

When opening a specially crafted 3DXML file, the application containing Datakit Software libraries CatiaV5_3dRead, CatiaV6_3dRead, Step3dRead, Ug3dReadPsr, Jt3dReadPsr modules in KeyShot Versions v10.1 and prior could disclose arbitrary files to remote attackers. This is because of the passing of specially crafted content to the underlying XML parser without taking proper restrictions such as prohibiting an external DTD.
