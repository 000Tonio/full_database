# CVE-2021-4357

- Published: 2023-06-07T02:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-07T02:44:00

The uListing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks, and a missing security nonce, on the UlistingUserRole::save_role_api function in versions up to, and including, 1.6.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to arbitrarily delete site posts and pages.
