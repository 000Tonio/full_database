# CVE-2021-3923

- Published: 2023-03-27T21:15:00

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's implementation of RDMA over infiniband. An attacker with a privileged local account can leak kernel stack information when issuing commands to the /dev/infiniband/rdma_cm device node. While this access is unlikely to leak sensitive user information, it can be further used to defeat existing kernel protection mechanisms.
