SAP Lumira Server version 2.4 does not sufficiently encode user controlled inputs, resulting in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This would allow an attacker with basic level privileges to store a malicious script on SAP Lumira Server. The execution of the script content, by a victim registered on SAP Lumira Server, could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of SAP Lumira content.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
