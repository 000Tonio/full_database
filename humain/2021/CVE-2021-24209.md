# CVE-2021-24209

- Published: 2021-04-05T19:15:00

- Modified: 2021-05-04T15:02:00

The WP Super Cache WordPress plugin before 1.7.2 was affected by an authenticated (admin+) RCE in the settings page due to input validation failure and weak $cache_path check in the WP Super Cache Settings -> Cache Location option. Direct access to the wp-cache-config.php file is not prohibited, so this vulnerability can be exploited for a web shell injection.

### CVSS Score: **9**
