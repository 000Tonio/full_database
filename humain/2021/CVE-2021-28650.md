# CVE-2021-28650

- Published: 2021-03-17T06:15:00

- Modified: 2022-05-20T20:49:00

autoar-extractor.c in GNOME gnome-autoar before 0.3.1, as used by GNOME Shell, Nautilus, and other software, allows Directory Traversal during extraction because it lacks a check of whether a file's parent is a symlink in certain complex situations. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-36241.
