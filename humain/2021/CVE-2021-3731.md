LedgerSMB does not sufficiently guard against being wrapped by other sites, making it vulnerable to 'clickjacking'. This allows an attacker to trick a targetted user to execute unintended actions.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
