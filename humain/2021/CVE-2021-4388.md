# CVE-2021-4388

- Published: 2023-07-01T05:15:00

- Modified: 2023-07-01T05:15:00

The Opal Estate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to featured property modifications in versions up to, and including, 1.6.11. This is due to missing  capability checks on the opalestate_set_feature_property() and opalestate_remove_feature_property() functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to set and remove featured properties.
