# CVE-2021-32662

Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals, and techdocs-common contains common functionalities for Backstage's TechDocs. In `@backstage/techdocs-common` versions prior to 0.6.3, a malicious actor could read sensitive files from the environment where TechDocs documentation is built and published by setting a particular path for `docs_dir` in `mkdocs.yml`. These files would then be available over the TechDocs backend API. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker would need access to modify the `mkdocs.yml` in the documentation source code, and would also need access to the TechDocs backend API. The vulnerability is patched in the `0.6.3` release of `@backstage/techdocs-common`.
