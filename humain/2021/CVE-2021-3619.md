Rapid7 Velociraptor 0.5.9 and prior is vulnerable to a post-authentication persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) issue, where an authenticated user could abuse MIME filetype sniffing to embed executable code on a malicious upload. This issue was fixed in version 0.6.0. Note that login rights to Velociraptor is nearly always reserved for trusted and verified users with IT security backgrounds.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
