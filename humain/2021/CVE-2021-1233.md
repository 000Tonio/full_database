A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco SD-WAN Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of requests that are sent to the iperf tool. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the iperf tool, which is included in Cisco SD-WAN Software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain any file from the filesystem of an affected device.
