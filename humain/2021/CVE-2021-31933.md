A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Chamilo through 1.11.14 due to improper input sanitization of a parameter used for file uploads, and improper file-extension filtering for certain filenames (e.g., .phar or .pht). A remote authenticated administrator is able to upload a file containing arbitrary PHP code into specific directories via main/inc/lib/fileUpload.lib.php directory traversal to achieve PHP code execution.
