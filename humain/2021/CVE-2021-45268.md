** DISPUTED ** A Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in Backdrop CMS 1.20, which allows Remote Attackers to gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the Hosting Webserver via uploading a maliciously add-on with crafted PHP file. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the attack requires a session cookie of a high-privileged authenticated user who is entitled to install arbitrary add-ons.
