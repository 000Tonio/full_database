A read-after-free memory flaw was found in the Linux kernel's garbage collection for Unix domain socket file handlers in the way users call close() and fget() simultaneously and can potentially trigger a race condition. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system. This flaw affects Linux kernel versions prior to 5.16-rc4.
