In Netflix OSS Hollow, since the Files.exists(parent) is run before creating the directories, an attacker can pre-create these directories with wide permissions. Additionally, since an insecure source of randomness is used, the file names to be created can be deterministically calculated.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
