The SEO Booster WordPress plugin before 3.8 allows for authenticated SQL injection via the "fn_my_ajaxified_dataloader_ajax" AJAX request as the $_REQUEST['order'][0]['dir'] parameter is not properly escaped leading to blind and error-based SQL injections.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
