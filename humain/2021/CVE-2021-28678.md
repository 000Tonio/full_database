# CVE-2021-28678

- Published: 2021-06-02T16:15:00

- Modified: 2021-09-14T14:29:00

An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. For BLP data, BlpImagePlugin did not properly check that reads (after jumping to file offsets) returned data. This could lead to a DoS where the decoder could be run a large number of times on empty data.
