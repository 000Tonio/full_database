The Bluetooth Classic implementation in the Cypress CYW920735Q60EVB does not properly handle the reception of continuous unsolicited LMP responses, allowing attackers in radio range to trigger a denial of service and restart (crash) of the device by flooding it with LMP_AU_Rand packets after the paging procedure.
