The eCommerce Product Catalog Plugin for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.9.43. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the implecode_save_products_meta() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save product meta data via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
