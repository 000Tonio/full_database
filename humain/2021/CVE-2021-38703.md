# CVE-2021-38703

- Published: 2021-09-01T12:15:00

Wireless devices running certain Arcadyan-derived firmware (such as KPN Experia WiFi 1.00.15) do not properly sanitise user input to the syslog configuration form. An authenticated remote attacker could leverage this to alter the device configuration and achieve remote code execution. This can be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2021-20090.
