An improper check for unusual or exceptional conditions vulnerability in Juniper Networks MX Series platforms with Trio-based MPC (Modular Port Concentrator) deployed in (Ethernet VPN) EVPN-(Virtual Extensible LAN) VXLAN configuration, may allow an attacker sending specific Layer 2 traffic to cause Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection to trigger unexpectedly, resulting in traffic impact. Continued receipt and processing of this specific Layer 2 frames will sustain the Denial of Service (DoS) condition. An indication of compromise is to check DDOS LACP violations: user@device> show ddos-protection protocols statistics brief | match lacp This issue only affects the MX Series platforms with Trio-based MPC. No other products or platforms are affected. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series: 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R7-S9; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S11; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R3-S4; 18.1 versions prior to 18.1R3-S12; 18.2 versions prior to 18.2R2-S8, 18.2R3-S8; 18.3 versions prior to 18.3R3-S4; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R1-S8, 18.4R2-S7, 18.4R3-S7; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S4; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S6; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S2; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S4, 19.4R3-S2; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R2-S1, 20.2R3; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R1-S1, 20.3R2;
