The Listeo WordPress theme before 1.6.11 did not ensure that the Post/Page and Booking to delete belong to the user making the request, allowing any authenticated users to delete arbitrary page/post and booking via an IDOR vector.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
