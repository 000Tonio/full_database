Gryphon Tower routers contain an unprotected openvpn configuration file which can grant attackers access to the Gryphon homebound VPN network which exposes the LAN interfaces of other users' devices connected to the same service. An attacker could leverage this to make configuration changes to, or otherwise attack victims' devices as though they were on an adjacent network.
