An issue was discovered in AnyDesk before 6.2.6 and 6.3.x before 6.3.5. An upload of an arbitrary file to a victim's local ~/Downloads/ directory is possible if the victim is using the AnyDesk Windows client to connect to a remote machine, if an attacker is also connected remotely with AnyDesk to the same remote machine. The upload is done without any approval or action taken by the victim.
