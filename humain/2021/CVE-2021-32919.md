# CVE-2021-32919

- Published: 2021-05-13T16:15:00

- Modified: 2021-05-26T19:26:00

An issue was discovered in Prosody before 0.11.9. The undocumented dialback_without_dialback option in mod_dialback enables an experimental feature for server-to-server authentication. It does not correctly authenticate remote server certificates, allowing a remote server to impersonate another server (when this option is enabled).

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
