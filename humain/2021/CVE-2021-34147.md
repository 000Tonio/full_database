The Bluetooth Classic implementation in the Cypress WICED BT stack through 2.9.0 for CYW20735B1 does not properly handle the reception of a malformed LMP timing accuracy response followed by multiple reconnections to the link slave, allowing attackers to exhaust device BT resources and eventually trigger a crash via multiple attempts of sending a crafted LMP timing accuracy response followed by a sudden reconnection with a random BDAddress.
