# CVE-2021-27691

- Published: 2021-04-16T00:15:00

Command Injection in Tenda G0 routers with firmware versions v15.11.0.6(9039)_CN and v15.11.0.5(5876)_CN , and Tenda G1 and G3 routers with firmware versions v15.11.0.17(9502)_CN or v15.11.0.16(9024)_CN allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted action/setDebugCfg request. This occurs because the "formSetDebugCfg" function executes glibc's system function with untrusted input.
