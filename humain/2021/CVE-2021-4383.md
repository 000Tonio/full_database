# CVE-2021-4383

- Published: 2023-06-07T02:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-07T02:44:00

The WP Quick FrontEnd Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to page content injection in versions up to, and including, 5.5. This is due to missing capability checks in the plugin's page-editing functionality. This makes it possible for low-authenticated attackers, such as subscribers, to edit/create any page or post on the blog.
