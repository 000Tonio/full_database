# CVE-2021-38540

- Published: 2021-09-09T15:15:00

- Modified: 2021-09-21T13:56:00

The variable import endpoint was not protected by authentication in Airflow >=2.0.0, <2.1.3. This allowed unauthenticated users to hit that endpoint to add/modify Airflow variables used in DAGs, potentially resulting in a denial of service, information disclosure or remote code execution. This issue affects Apache Airflow >=2.0.0, <2.1.3.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
