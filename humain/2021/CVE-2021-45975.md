In ListCheck.exe in Acer Care Center 4.x before 4.00.3038, a vulnerability in the loading mechanism of Windows DLLs could allow a local attacker to perform a DLL hijacking attack. This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of directory search paths at run time. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by placing a malicious DLL file on the targeted system. This file will execute when the vulnerable application launches. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system with local administrator privileges.
