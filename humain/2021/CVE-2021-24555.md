# CVE-2021-24555

- Published: 2021-08-23T12:15:00

- Modified: 2022-11-09T19:19:00

The daac_delete_booking_callback function, hooked to the daac_delete_booking AJAX action, takes the id POST parameter which is passed into the SQL statement without proper sanitisation, validation or escaping, leading to a SQL Injection issue. Furthermore, the ajax action is lacking any CSRF and capability check, making it available to any authenticated user.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**
