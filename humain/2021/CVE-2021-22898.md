# CVE-2021-22898

- Published: 2021-06-11T16:15:00

- Modified: 2022-08-30T19:09:00

curl 7.7 through 7.76.1 suffers from an information disclosure when the `-t` command line option, known as `CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS` in libcurl, is used to send variable=content pairs to TELNET servers. Due to a flaw in the option parser for sending NEW_ENV variables, libcurl could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to the server, resulting in potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using a clear-text network protocol.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
