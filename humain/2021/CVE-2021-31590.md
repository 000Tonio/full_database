# CVE-2021-31590

- Published: 2021-07-19T20:15:00

- Modified: 2022-07-12T17:42:00

PwnDoc all versions until 0.4.0 (2021-08-23) has incorrect JSON Webtoken handling, leading to incorrect access control. With a valid JSON Webtoken that is used for authentication and authorization, a user can keep his admin privileges even if he is downgraded to the "user" privilege. Even after a user's account is deleted, the user can still access the administration panel (and add or delete users) and has complete access to the system.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
