Adobe Premiere Rush versions 1.5.16 (and earlier) allows access to an uninitialized pointer vulnerability that allows remote attackers to disclose arbitrary data on affected installations. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of MP4 files. The issue results from the lack of proper initialization of memory prior to accessing it.
