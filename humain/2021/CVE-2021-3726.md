# Vulnerability in `title` function **Description**: the `title` function defined in `lib/termsupport.zsh` uses `print` to set the terminal title to a user-supplied string. In Oh My Zsh, this function is always used securely, but custom user code could use the `title` function in a way that is unsafe. **Fixed in**: [a263cdac](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/commit/a263cdac). **Impacted areas**: - `title` function in `lib/termsupport.zsh`. - Custom user code using the `title` function.
