mySCADA myDESIGNER 8.20.0 and below allows Directory Traversal attacks when importing project files. If an attacker can trick a victim into importing a malicious mep file, then they gain the ability to write arbitrary files to OS locations where the user has permission. This would typically lead to code execution.
