# CVE-2021-4368

- Published: 2023-06-07T02:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-07T02:44:00

The Frontend File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Authenticated Settings Change in versions up to, and including, 18.2. This is due to lacking capability checks and a security nonce, all on the wpfm_save_settings AJAX action. This makes it possible for subscriber-level attackers to edit the plugin settings, such as the allowed upload file types.  This can lead to remote code execution through other vulnerabilities.

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
