A redirect vulnerability in the `fastify-static` module version >= 4.2.4 and < 4.4.1 allows remote attackers to redirect Mozilla Firefox users to arbitrary websites via a double slash `//` followed by a domain: `http://localhost:3000//a//youtube.com/%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e`.A DOS vulnerability is possible if the URL contains invalid characters `curl --path-as-is "http://localhost:3000//^/.."`The issue shows up on all the `fastify-static` applications that set `redirect: true` option. By default, it is `false`.
