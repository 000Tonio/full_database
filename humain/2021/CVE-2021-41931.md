The Company's Recruitment Management System in id=2 of the parameter from view_vacancy app on-page appears to be vulnerable to SQL injection. The payloads 19424269' or '1309'='1309 and 39476597' or '2917'='2923 were each submitted in the id parameter. These two requests resulted in different responses, indicating that the input is being incorporated into a SQL query in an unsafe way.
