The Background service in Allwinner R818 SoC Android Q SDK V1.0 is used to manage background applications. Malicious apps can use the interface provided by the service to set the number of applications allowed to run in the background to 0 and add themselves to the whitelist, so that once other applications enter the background, they will be forcibly stopped by the system, causing a denial of service.
