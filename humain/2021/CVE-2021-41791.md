An issue was discovered in Hyland org.alfresco:share through 7.0.0.2 and org.alfresco:community-share through 7.0. An evasion of the XSS filter for HTML input validation in the Alfresco Share User Interface leads to stored XSS that could be exploited by an attacker (given that he has privileges on the content collaboration features).
