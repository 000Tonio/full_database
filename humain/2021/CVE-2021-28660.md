rtw_wx_set_scan in drivers/staging/rtl8188eu/os_dep/ioctl_linux.c in the Linux kernel through 5.11.6 allows writing beyond the end of the ->ssid[] array. NOTE: from the perspective of kernel.org releases, CVE IDs are not normally used for drivers/staging/* (unfinished work); however, system integrators may have situations in which a drivers/staging issue is relevant to their own customer base.

### CVSS Score: **8.3**
