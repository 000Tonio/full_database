The BP Better Messages WordPress plugin before 1.9.9.41 does not check for CSRF in multiple of its AJAX actions: bp_better_messages_leave_chat, bp_better_messages_join_chat, bp_messages_leave_thread, bp_messages_mute_thread, bp_messages_unmute_thread, bp_better_messages_add_user_to_thread, bp_better_messages_exclude_user_from_thread. This could allow attackers to make logged in users do unwanted actions
