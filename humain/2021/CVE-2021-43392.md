STMicroelectronics STSAFE-J 1.1.4, J-SAFE3 1.2.5, and J-SIGN sometimes allow attackers to obtain information on cryptographic secrets. This is associated with the ECDSA signature algorithm on the Java Card J-SAFE3 and STSAFE-J platforms exposing a 3.0.4 Java Card API. It is exploitable for STSAFE-J in closed configuration and J-SIGN (when signature verification is activated) but not for J-SAFE3 EPASS BAC and EAC products. It might also impact other products based on the J-SAFE-3 Java Card platform.
