# CVE-2021-4074

- Published: 2022-01-18T17:15:00

The WHMCS Bridge WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the cc_whmcs_bridge_url parameter found in the ~/whmcs-bridge/bridge_cp.php file which allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 6.1. Due to missing authorization checks on the cc_whmcs_bridge_add_admin function, low-level authenticated users such as subscribers can exploit this vulnerability.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
