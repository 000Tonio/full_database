ImpressCMS before 1.4.3 has Incorrect Access Control because include/findusers.php allows access by unauthenticated attackers (who are, by design, able to have a security token).

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
