Attendance Management System 1.0 is affected by a Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The value of the FirstRecord request parameter is copied into the value of an HTML tag attribute which is encapsulated in double quotation marks. The attacker can access the system, by using the XSS-reflected method, and then can store information by injecting the admin account on this system.
