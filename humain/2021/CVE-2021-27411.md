Micrium OS Versions 5.10.1 and prior are vulnerable to integer wrap-around in functions Mem_DynPoolCreate, Mem_DynPoolCreateHW and Mem_PoolCreate. This unverified memory assignment can lead to arbitrary memory allocation, resulting in unexpected behavior such as very small blocks of memory being allocated instead of very large ones.
