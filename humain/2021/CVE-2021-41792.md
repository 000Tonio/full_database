An issue was discovered in Hyland org.alfresco:alfresco-content-services through 6.2.2.18 and org.alfresco:alfresco-transform-services through 1.3. A crafted HTML file, once uploaded, could trigger an unexpected request by the transformation engine. The response to the request is not available to the attacker, i.e., this is blind SSRF.
