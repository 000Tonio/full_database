The Stripe for WooCommerce WordPress plugin is missing a capability check on the save() function found in the ~/includes/admin/class-wc-stripe-admin-user-edit.php file that makes it possible for attackers to configure their account to use other site users unique STRIPE identifier and make purchases with their payment accounts. This affects versions 3.0.0 - 3.3.9.
