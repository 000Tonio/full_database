The Integration Builder Framework of SAP Process Integration versions - 7.10, 7.11, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50, does not sufficiently validate an XML document uploaded from local source. An attacker can craft a malicious XML which when uploaded and parsed by the application, could lead to Denial-of-service conditions due to consumption of a large amount of system memory, thus highly impacting system availability.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
