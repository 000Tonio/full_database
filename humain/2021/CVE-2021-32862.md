The GitHub Security Lab discovered sixteen ways to exploit a cross-site scripting vulnerability in nbconvert. When using nbconvert to generate an HTML version of a user-controllable notebook, it is possible to inject arbitrary HTML which may lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if these HTML notebooks are served by a web server (eg: nbviewer).
