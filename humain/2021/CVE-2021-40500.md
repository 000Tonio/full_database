SAP BusinessObjects Business Intelligence Platform (Crystal Reports) - versions 420, 430, allows an unauthenticated attacker to exploit missing XML validations at endpoints to read sensitive data. These endpoints are normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation can enable the attacker to retrieve arbitrary files from the server.
