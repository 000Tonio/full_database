An Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions in packet processing on the MS-MPC/MS-MIC utilized by Juniper Networks Junos OS allows a malicious attacker to send a specific packet, triggering the MS-MPC/MS-MIC to reset, causing a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt and processing of this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
