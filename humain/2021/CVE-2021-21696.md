# CVE-2021-21696

Jenkins 2.318 and earlier, LTS 2.303.2 and earlier does not limit agent read/write access to the libs/ directory inside build directories when using the FilePath APIs, allowing attackers in control of agent processes to replace the code of a trusted library with a modified variant. This results in unsandboxed code execution in the Jenkins controller process.
