# CVE-2021-27706

Buffer Overflow in Tenda G1 and G3 routers with firmware version V15.11.0.17(9502)_CN allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted action/"IPMacBindIndex "request. This occurs because the "formIPMacBindDel" function directly passes the parameter "IPMacBindIndex" to strcpy without limit.
