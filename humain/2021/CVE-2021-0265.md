An unvalidated REST API in the AppFormix Agent of Juniper Networks AppFormix allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute commands as root on the host running the AppFormix Agent, when certain preconditions are performed by the attacker, thus granting the attacker full control over the environment. This issue affects: Juniper Networks AppFormix 3 versions prior to 3.1.22, 3.2.14, 3.3.0.
