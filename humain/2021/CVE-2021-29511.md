# CVE-2021-29511

- Published: 2021-05-12T18:15:00

- Modified: 2022-10-25T19:13:00

evm is a pure Rust implementation of Ethereum Virtual Machine. Prior to the patch, when executing specific EVM opcodes related to memory operations that use `evm_core::Memory::copy_large`, the `evm` crate can over-allocate memory when it is not needed, making it possible for an attacker to perform denial-of-service attack. The flaw was corrected in commit `19ade85`. Users should upgrade to `==0.21.1, ==0.23.1, ==0.24.1, ==0.25.1, >=0.26.1`. There are no workarounds. Please upgrade your `evm` crate version.
