Pelco Digital Sentry Server 7.18.72.11464 has an XML External Entity vulnerability (exploitable via the DTD parameter entities technique), resulting in disclosure and retrieval of arbitrary data on the affected node via an out-of-band (OOB) attack. The vulnerability is triggered when input passed to the XML parser is not sanitized while parsing the ControlPointCacheShare.xml file (in a %APPDATA%\Pelco directory) when DSControlPoint.exe is executed.
