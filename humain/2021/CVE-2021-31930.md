Persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) in the web interface of Concerto through 2.3.6 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to introduce arbitrary JavaScript by injecting an XSS payload into the First Name or Last Name parameter upon registration. When a privileged user attempts to delete the account, the XSS payload will be executed.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
