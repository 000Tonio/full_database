It was discovered that the SteelCentral AppInternals Dynamic Sampling Agent (DSA) uses the ".debug_command.config" file to store a json string that contains a list of IDs and pre-configured commands. The config file is subsequently used by the "/api/appInternals/1.0/agent/configuration" API to map the corresponding ID to a command to be executed.
