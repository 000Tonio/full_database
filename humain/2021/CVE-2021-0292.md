# CVE-2021-0292

- Published: 2021-07-15T20:15:00

An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in the ARP daemon (arpd) and Network Discovery Protocol (ndp) process of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a malicious attacker on the local network to consume memory resources, ultimately resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Link-layer functions such as IPv4 and/or IPv6 address resolution may be impacted, leading to traffic loss. The processes do not recover on their own and must be manually restarted. Changes in memory usage can be monitored using the following shell commands (header shown for clarity): user@router:/var/log# ps aux | grep arpd USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND root 31418 59.0 0.7 *5702564* 247952 ? xxx /usr/sbin/arpd --app-name arpd -I object_select --shared-objects-mode 3 user@router:/var/log# ps aux | grep arpd USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND root 31418 49.1 1.0 *5813156* 351184 ? xxx /usr/sbin/arpd --app-name arpd -I object_select --shared-objects-mode 3 Memory usage can be monitored for the ndp process in a similar fashion: user@router:/var/log# ps aux | grep ndp USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND root 14935 0.0 0.1 *5614052* 27256 ?

Ssl Jun15 0:17 /usr/sbin/ndp -I no_tab_chk,object_select --app-name ndp --shared-obje This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S3-EVO; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S4-EVO; all versions of 20.2-EVO. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 19.4R2-EVO.
