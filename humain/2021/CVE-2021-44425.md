An issue was discovered in AnyDesk before 6.2.6 and 6.3.x before 6.3.3. An unnecessarily open listening port on a machine in the LAN of an attacker, opened by the Anydesk Windows client when using the tunneling feature, allows the attacker unauthorized access to the local machine's AnyDesk tunneling protocol stack (and also to any remote destination machine software that is listening to the AnyDesk tunneled port).
