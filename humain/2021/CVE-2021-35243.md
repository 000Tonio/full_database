The HTTP PUT and DELETE methods were enabled in the Web Help Desk web server (12.7.7 and earlier), allowing users to execute dangerous HTTP requests. The HTTP PUT method is normally used to upload data that is saved on the server with a user-supplied URL. While the DELETE method requests that the origin server removes the association between the target resource and its current functionality. Improper use of these methods may lead to a loss of integrity.
