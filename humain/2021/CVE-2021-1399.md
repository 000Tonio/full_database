A vulnerability in the Self Care Portal of Cisco Unified Communications Manager (Unified CM) and Cisco Unified Communications Manager Session Management Edition (Unified CM SME) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to modify data on an affected system without proper authorization. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied data to the Self Care Portal. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to an affected system.
