# CVE-2021-30493

- Published: 2021-04-14T15:15:00

- Modified: 2021-04-22T15:11:00

Multiple system services installed alongside the Razer Synapse 3 software suite perform privileged operations on entries within the ChromaBroadcast subkey. These privileged operations consist of file name concatenation of a runtime log file that is used to store runtime log information. In other words, an attacker can create a file in an unintended directory (with some limitations).
