vpn-user-portal (aka eduVPN or Let's Connect!) before 2.3.14, as packaged for Debian 10, Debian 11, and Fedora, allows remote authenticated users to obtain OS filesystem access, because of the interaction of QR codes with an exec that uses the -r option. This can be leveraged to obtain additional VPN access.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
