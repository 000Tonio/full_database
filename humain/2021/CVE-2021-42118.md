Persistent Cross Site Scripting in Web Applications operating on Business-DNA Solutions GmbHâ€™s TopEaseÂ® Platform Version <= 7.1.27 via the Structure Component allows an authenticated remote attacker with Object Modification privileges to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code in an object attribute, which is then rendered in the Structure Component, to alter the intended functionality and steal cookies, the latter allowing for account takeover.
