In Gradle Enterprise through 2021.3, probing of the server-side network environment can occur via an SMTP configuration test. The installation configuration user interface available to administrators allows testing the configured SMTP server settings. This test function can be used to identify the listening TCP ports available to the server, revealing information about the internal network environment.
