Odyssey passes to server unencrypted bytes from man-in-the-middle When Odyssey is configured to use certificate Common Name for client authentication, a man-in-the-middle attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries when a connection is first established, despite the use of SSL certificate verification and encryption. This is similar to CVE-2021-23214 for PostgreSQL.
