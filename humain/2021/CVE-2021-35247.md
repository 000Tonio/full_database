Serv-U web login screen to LDAP authentication was allowing characters that were not sufficiently sanitized. SolarWinds has updated the input mechanism to perform additional validation and sanitization. Please Note: No downstream affect has been detected as the LDAP servers ignored improper characters. To insure proper input validation is completed in all environments. SolarWinds recommends scheduling an update to the latest version of Serv-U.

### CVSS Score: **5**
