Phoenix Contact Classic Line Controllers ILC1x0 and ILC1x1 in all versions/variants are affected by a Denial-of-Service vulnerability. The communication protocols and device access do not feature authentication measures. Remote attackers can use specially crafted IP packets to cause a denial of service on the PLC's network communication module. A successful attack stops all network communication. To restore the network connectivity the device needs to be restarted. The automation task is not affected.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
