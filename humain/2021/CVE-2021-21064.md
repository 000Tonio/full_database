Magento UPWARD-php version 1.1.4 (and earlier) is affected by a Path traversal vulnerability in Magento UPWARD Connector version 1.1.2 (and earlier) due to the upload feature. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to upload a malicious YAML file that can contain instructions which allows reading arbitrary files from the remote server. Access to the admin console is required for successful exploitation.
