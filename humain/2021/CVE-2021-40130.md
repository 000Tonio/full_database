A vulnerability in the web application of Cisco Common Services Platform Collector (CSPC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to specify non-log files as sources for syslog reporting. This vulnerability is due to improper restriction of the syslog configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by configuring non-log files as sources for syslog reporting through the web application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read non-log files on the CSPC.
