# CVE-2021-3935

- Published: 2021-11-22T16:15:00

- Modified: 2022-03-16T17:22:00

When PgBouncer is configured to use "cert" authentication, a man-in-the-middle attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries when a connection is first established, despite the use of TLS certificate verification and encryption. This flaw affects PgBouncer versions prior to 1.16.1.

### CVSS Score: **5.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
