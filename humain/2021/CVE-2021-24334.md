The Instant Images â€“ One Click Unsplash Uploads WordPress plugin before 4.4.0.1 did not properly validate and sanitise its unsplash_download_w and unsplash_download_h parameter settings (/wp-admin/upload.php?page=instant-images), only validating them client side before saving them, leading to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting issue.
