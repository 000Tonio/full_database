There is a pointer double free vulnerability in some versions of CloudEngine 5800, CloudEngine 6800, CloudEngine 7800 and CloudEngine 12800. When a function is called, the same memory pointer is copied to two functional modules. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by performing a malicious operation to cause the pointer double free.
