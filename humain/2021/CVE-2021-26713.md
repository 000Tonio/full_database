A stack-based buffer overflow in res_rtp_asterisk.c in Sangoma Asterisk before 16.16.1, 17.x before 17.9.2, and 18.x before 18.2.1 and Certified Asterisk before 16.8-cert6 allows an authenticated WebRTC client to cause an Asterisk crash by sending multiple hold/unhold requests in quick succession. This is caused by a signedness comparison mismatch.

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
