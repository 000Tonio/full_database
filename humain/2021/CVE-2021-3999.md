# CVE-2021-3999

- Published: 2022-08-24T16:15:00

- Modified: 2023-02-12T23:43:00

A flaw was found in glibc. An off-by-one buffer overflow and underflow in getcwd() may lead to memory corruption when the size of the buffer is exactly 1. A local attacker who can control the input buffer and size passed to getcwd() in a setuid program could use this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code and escalate their privileges on the system.
