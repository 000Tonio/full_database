Stargate-Bukkit is a mod for the minecraft video game which adds a portal focused environment. In affected versions Minecarts with chests will drop their items when teleporting through a portal; when they reappear, they will still have their items impacting the integrity of the game world. The teleport code has since been rewritten and is available in release `0.11.5.1`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
