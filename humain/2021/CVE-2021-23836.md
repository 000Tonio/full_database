An issue was discovered in flatCore before 2.0.0 build 139. A stored XSS vulnerability was identified in the prefs_smtp_psw HTTP request body parameter for the acp interface. An admin user can inject malicious client-side script into the affected parameter without any form of input sanitization. The injected payload will be executed in the browser of a user whenever one visits the affected module page.
