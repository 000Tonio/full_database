# CVE-2021-46828

- Published: 2022-07-20T06:15:00

- Modified: 2022-12-02T20:02:00

In libtirpc before 1.3.3rc1, remote attackers could exhaust the file descriptors of a process that uses libtirpc because idle TCP connections are mishandled. This can, in turn, lead to an svc_run infinite loop without accepting new connections.
