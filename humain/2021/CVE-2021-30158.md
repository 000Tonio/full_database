An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.31.12 and 1.32.x through 1.35.x before 1.35.2. Blocked users are unable to use Special:ResetTokens. This has security relevance because a blocked user might have accidentally shared a token, or might know that a token has been compromised, and yet is not able to block any potential future use of the token by an unauthorized party.

### CVSS Score: **5**
