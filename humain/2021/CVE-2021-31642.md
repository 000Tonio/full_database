A denial of service condition exists after an integer overflow in several IoT devices from CHIYU Technology, including BIOSENSE, Webpass, and BF-630, BF-631, and SEMAC. The vulnerability can be explored by sending an unexpected integer (> 32 bits) on the page parameter that will crash the web portal and making it unavailable until a reboot of the device.
