In Kibana versions before 7.12.0 and 6.8.15 a flaw in the session timeout was discovered where the xpack.security.session.idleTimeout setting is not being respected. This was caused by background polling activities unintentionally extending authenticated users sessions, preventing a user session from timing out.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |
