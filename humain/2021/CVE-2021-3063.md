An improper handling of exceptional conditions vulnerability exists in Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect portal and gateway interfaces that enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to send specifically crafted traffic to a GlobalProtect interface that causes the service to stop responding. Repeated attempts to send this request result in denial of service to all PAN-OS services by restarting the device and putting it into maintenance mode. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 8.1.21; PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.14-h4; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.11-h3; PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.8-h4; PAN-OS 10.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.1.3. Prisma Access customers are not impacted by this issue.
