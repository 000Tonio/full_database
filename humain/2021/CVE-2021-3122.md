CMCAgent in NCR Command Center Agent 16.3 on Aloha POS/BOH servers permits the submission of a runCommand parameter (within an XML document sent to port 8089) that enables the remote, unauthenticated execution of an arbitrary command as SYSTEM, as exploited in the wild in 2020 and/or 2021. NOTE: the vendor's position is that exploitation occurs only on devices with a certain "misconfiguration."
