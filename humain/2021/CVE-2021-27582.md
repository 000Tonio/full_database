org/mitre/oauth2/web/OAuthConfirmationController.java in the OpenID Connect server implementation for MITREid Connect through 1.3.3 contains a Mass Assignment (aka Autobinding) vulnerability. This arises due to unsafe usage of the @ModelAttribute annotation during the OAuth authorization flow, in which HTTP request parameters affect an authorizationRequest.
