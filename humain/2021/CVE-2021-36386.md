# CVE-2021-36386

- Published: 2021-07-30T14:15:00

- Modified: 2022-10-28T13:14:00

report_vbuild in report.c in Fetchmail before 6.4.20 sometimes omits initialization of the vsnprintf va_list argument, which might allow mail servers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via long error messages. NOTE: it is unclear whether use of Fetchmail on any realistic platform results in an impact beyond an inconvenience to the client user.

### CVSS Score: **5**
