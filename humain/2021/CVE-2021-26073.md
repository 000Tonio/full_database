# CVE-2021-26073

Broken Authentication in Atlassian Connect Express (ACE) from version 3.0.2 before version 6.6.0: Atlassian Connect Express is a Node.js package for building Atlassian Connect apps. Authentication between Atlassian products and the Atlassian Connect Express app occurs with a server-to-server JWT or a context JWT. Atlassian Connect Express versions from 3.0.2 before 6.6.0 erroneously accept context JWTs in lifecycle endpoints (such as installation) where only server-to-server JWTs should be accepted, permitting an attacker to send authenticated re-installation events to an app.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
