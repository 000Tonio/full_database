The package koa-remove-trailing-slashes before 2.0.2 are vulnerable to Open Redirect via the use of trailing double slashes in the URL when accessing the vulnerable endpoint (such as https://example.com//attacker.example/). The vulnerable code is in index.js::removeTrailingSlashes(), as the web server uses relative URLs instead of absolute URLs.
