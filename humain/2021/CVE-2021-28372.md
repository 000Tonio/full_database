ThroughTek's Kalay Platform 2.0 network allows an attacker to impersonate an arbitrary ThroughTek (TUTK) device given a valid 20-byte uniquely assigned identifier (UID). This could result in an attacker hijacking a victim's connection and forcing them into supplying credentials needed to access the victim TUTK device.
