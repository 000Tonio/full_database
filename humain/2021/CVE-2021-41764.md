A cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability exists in Streama up to and including v1.10.3. The application does not have CSRF checks in place when performing actions such as uploading local files. As a result, attackers could make a logged-in administrator upload arbitrary local files via a CSRF attack and send them to the attacker.
