# CVE-2021-44223

WordPress before 5.8 lacks support for the Update URI plugin header. This makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a supply-chain attack against WordPress installations that use any plugin for which the slug satisfies the naming constraints of the WordPress.org Plugin Directory but is not yet present in that directory.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
