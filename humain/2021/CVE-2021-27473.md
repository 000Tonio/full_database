Rockwell Automation Connected Components Workbench v12.00.00 and prior does not sanitize paths specified within the .ccwarc archive file during extraction. This type of vulnerability is also commonly referred to as a Zip Slip. A local, authenticated attacker can create a malicious .ccwarc archive file that, when opened by Connected Components Workbench, will allow the attacker to gain the privileges of the software. If the software is running at SYSTEM level, the attacker will gain admin level privileges. User interaction is required for this exploit to be successful.
