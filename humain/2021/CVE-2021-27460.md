Rockwell Automation FactoryTalk AssetCentre v10.00 and earlier components contain .NET remoting endpoints that deserialize untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid. This vulnerability may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to gain full access to the FactoryTalk AssetCentre main server and all agent machines.
