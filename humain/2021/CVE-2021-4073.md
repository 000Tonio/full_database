The RegistrationMagic WordPress plugin made it possible for unauthenticated users to log in as any site user, including administrators, if they knew a valid username on the site due to missing identity validation in the social login function social_login_using_email() of the plugin. This affects versions equal to, and less than, 5.0.1.7.
