There is a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the formSetPPTPServer function of Tenda-AX3 router V16.03.12.10_CN. The v13 variable is directly retrieved from the http request parameter startIp. Then v13 will be splice to stack by function sscanf without any security check, which causes stack overflow. By POSTing the page /goform/SetPptpServerCfg with proper startIp, the attacker can easily perform remote code execution with carefully crafted overflow data.
