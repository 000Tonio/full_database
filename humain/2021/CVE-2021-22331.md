There is a JavaScript injection vulnerability in certain Huawei smartphones. A module does not verify some inputs sufficiently. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious application request to launch JavaScript injection. This may compromise normal service. Affected product versions include HUAWEI P30 versions earlier than 10.1.0.165(C01E165R2P11), 11.0.0.118(C635E2R1P3), 11.0.0.120(C00E120R2P5), 11.0.0.138(C10E4R5P3), 11.0.0.138(C185E4R7P3), 11.0.0.138(C432E8R2P3), 11.0.0.138(C461E4R3P3), 11.0.0.138(C605E4R1P3), and 11.0.0.138(C636E4R3P3).
