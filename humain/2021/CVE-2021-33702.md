Under certain conditions, NetWeaver Enterprise Portal, versions - 7.10, 7.11, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50, does not sufficiently encode report data. An attacker can craft malicious data and print it to the report. In a successful attack, a victim opens the report, and the malicious script gets executed in the victim's browser, resulting in a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**
