# CVE-2021-4379

- Published: 2023-06-07T13:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-07T14:35:00

The WooCommerce Multi Currency plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the wmc_bulk_fixed_price function in versions up to, and including, 2.1.17. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to make changes to product prices.

### CVSS Score: **null**
