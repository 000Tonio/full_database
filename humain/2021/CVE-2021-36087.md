# CVE-2021-36087

- Published: 2021-07-01T03:15:00

- Modified: 2021-11-17T14:05:00

The CIL compiler in SELinux 3.2 has a heap-based buffer over-read in ebitmap_match_any (called indirectly from cil_check_neverallow). This occurs because there is sometimes a lack of checks for invalid statements in an optional block.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
