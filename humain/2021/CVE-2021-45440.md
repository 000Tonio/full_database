A unnecessary privilege vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One and Trend Micro Worry-Free Business Security 10.0 SP1 (on-prem versions only) could allow a local attacker to abuse an impersonation privilege and elevate to a higher level of privileges. Please note: an attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.
