The Social Share, Social Login and Social Comments Plugin WordPress plugin before 7.13.30 does not sanitise and escape the urls parameter in its the_champ_sharing_count AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users) before outputting it back in the response, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting issue.
