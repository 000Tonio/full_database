# CVE-2021-4238

- Published: 2022-12-27T22:15:00

- Modified: 2023-01-05T04:43:00

Randomly-generated alphanumeric strings contain significantly less entropy than expected. The RandomAlphaNumeric and CryptoRandomAlphaNumeric functions always return strings containing at least one digit from 0 to 9. This significantly reduces the amount of entropy in short strings generated by these functions.
