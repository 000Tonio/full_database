Revive Adserver before v5.2.0 is vulnerable to a reflected XSS vulnerability in the `statsBreakdown` parameter of stats.php (and possibly other scripts) due to single quotes not being escaped. An attacker could trick a user with access to the user interface of a Revive Adserver instance into clicking on a specifically crafted URL and pressing a certain key combination to execute injected JavaScript code.
