In Calibre-web, versions 0.6.0 to 0.6.13 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). By luring an authenticated user to click on a link, an attacker can create a new user role with admin privileges and attacker-controlled credentials, allowing them to take over the application.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
