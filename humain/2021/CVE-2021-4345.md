# CVE-2021-4345

- Published: 2023-06-07T02:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-07T02:44:00

The uListing plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability and nonce checks on the UlistingUserRole::save_role_api method in versions up to, and including, 1.6.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to remove or add roles, and add capabilities.
