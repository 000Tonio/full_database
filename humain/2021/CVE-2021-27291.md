# CVE-2021-27291

- Published: 2021-03-17T13:15:00

In pygments 1.1+, fixed in 2.7.4, the lexers used to parse programming languages rely heavily on regular expressions. Some of the regular expressions have exponential or cubic worst-case complexity and are vulnerable to ReDoS. By crafting malicious input, an attacker can cause a denial of service.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
