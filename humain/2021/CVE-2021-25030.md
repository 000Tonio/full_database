The Events Made Easy WordPress plugin before 2.2.36 does not sanitise and escape the search_text parameter before using it in a SQL statement via the eme_searchmail AJAX action, available to any authenticated users. As a result, users with a role as low as subscriber can call it and perform SQL injection attacks

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
