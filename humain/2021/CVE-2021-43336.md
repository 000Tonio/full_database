An Out-of-Bounds Write vulnerability exists when reading a DXF or DWG file using Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK before 2022.11. The specific issue exists within the parsing of DXF and DWG files. Crafted data in a DXF or DWG file (an invalid number of properties) can trigger a write operation past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
