An issue was discovered in the CentralAuth extension in MediaWiki through 1.36. The Special:GlobalUserRights page provided search results which, for a suppressed MediaWiki user, were different than for any other user, thus easily disclosing suppressed accounts (which are supposed to be completely hidden).
