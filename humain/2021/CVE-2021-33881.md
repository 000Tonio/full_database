On NXP MIFARE Ultralight and NTAG cards, an attacker can interrupt a write operation (aka conduct a "tear off" attack) over RFID to bypass a Monotonic Counter protection mechanism. The impact depends on how the anti tear-off feature is used in specific applications such as public transportation, physical access control, etc.
