# CVE-2021-3048

- Published: 2021-08-11T17:15:00

Certain invalid URL entries contained in an External Dynamic List (EDL) cause the Device Server daemon (devsrvr) to stop responding. This condition causes subsequent commits on the firewall to fail and prevents administrators from performing commits and configuration changes even though the firewall remains otherwise functional. If the firewall then restarts, it results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition and the firewall stops processing traffic. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 9.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.14; PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.9; PAN-OS 10.0 versions earlier than PAN-OS 10.0.5. PAN-OS 8.1 and PAN-OS 10.1 versions are not impacted.
