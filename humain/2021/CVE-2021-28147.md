The team sync HTTP API in Grafana Enterprise 6.x before 6.7.6, 7.x before 7.3.10, and 7.4.x before 7.4.5 has an Incorrect Access Control issue. On Grafana instances using an external authentication service and having the EditorsCanAdmin feature enabled, this vulnerability allows any authenticated user to add external groups to any existing team.
