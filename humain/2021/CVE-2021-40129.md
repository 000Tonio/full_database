A vulnerability in the configuration dashboard of Cisco Common Services Platform Collector (CSPC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to submit a SQL query through the CSPC configuration dashboard. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of uploaded files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by uploading a file containing a SQL query to the configuration dashboard. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read restricted information from the CSPC SQL database.
