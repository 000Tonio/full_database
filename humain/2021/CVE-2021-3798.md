# CVE-2021-3798

- Published: 2022-08-23T16:15:00

- Modified: 2023-02-12T23:42:00

A flaw was found in openCryptoki. The openCryptoki Soft token does not check if an EC key is valid when an EC key is created via C_CreateObject, nor when C_DeriveKey is used with ECDH public data. This may allow a malicious user to extract the private key by performing an invalid curve attack.
