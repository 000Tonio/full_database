In RSA Archer 6.9.SP1 P3, if some application functions are precluded by the Administrator, this can be bypassed by intercepting the API request at the /api/V2/internal/TaskPermissions/CheckTaskAccess endpoint. If the parameters of this request are replaced with empty fields, the attacker achieves access to the precluded functions.

### CVSS Score: **4**
