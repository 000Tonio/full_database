There is a path traversal vulnerability in Huawei FusionCube 6.0.2.The vulnerability is due to that the software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly validate the pathname. Successful exploit could allow the attacker to access a location that is outside of the restricted directory by a crafted filename.
