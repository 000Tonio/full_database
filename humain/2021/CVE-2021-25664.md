A vulnerability has been identified in Capital VSTAR (Versions including affected IPv6 stack), Nucleus NET (All versions), Nucleus ReadyStart V3 (All versions < V2017.02.4), Nucleus ReadyStart V4 (All versions < V4.1.0), Nucleus Source Code (Versions including affected IPv6 stack). The function that processes the Hop-by-Hop extension header in IPv6 packets and its options lacks any checks against the length field of the header, allowing attackers to put the function into an infinite loop by supplying arbitrary length values.
