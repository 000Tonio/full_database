# CVE-2021-25076

- Published: 2022-01-24T08:15:00

- Modified: 2022-02-21T18:15:00

The WP User Frontend WordPress plugin before 3.5.26 does not validate and escape the status parameter before using it in a SQL statement in the Subscribers dashboard, leading to an SQL injection. Due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping, this could also lead to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
