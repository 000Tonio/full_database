# CVE-2021-31786

- Published: 2021-09-07T07:15:00

- Modified: 2022-07-12T17:42:00

The Bluetooth Classic Audio implementation on Actions ATS2815 and ATS2819 devices does not properly handle a connection attempt from a host with the same BDAddress as the current connected BT host, allowing attackers to trigger a disconnection and deadlock of the device by connecting with a forged BDAddress that matches the original connected host.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
