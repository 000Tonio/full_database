In TP-Link TL-XDR3230 < 1.0.12, TL-XDR1850 < 1.0.9, TL-XDR1860 < 1.0.14, TL-XDR3250 < 1.0.2, TL-XDR6060 Turbo < 1.1.8, TL-XDR5430 < 1.0.11, and possibly others, when IPv6 is used, a routing loop can occur that generates excessive network traffic between an affected device and its upstream ISP's router. This occurs when a link prefix route points to a point-to-point link, a destination IPv6 address belongs to the prefix and is not a local IPv6 address, and a router advertisement is received with at least one global unique IPv6 prefix for which the on-link flag is set.
