# CVE-2021-37748

- Published: 2021-10-28T12:15:00

- Modified: 2021-11-03T14:00:00

Multiple buffer overflows in the limited configuration shell (/sbin/gs_config) on Grandstream HT801 devices before 1.0.29 allow remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code as root via a crafted manage_if setting, thus bypassing the intended restrictions of this shell and taking full control of the device. There are default weak credentials that can be used to authenticate.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
