Wire is a collaboration platform. wire-ios-transport handles authentication of requests, network failures, and retries for the iOS implementation of Wire. In the 3.82 version of the iOS application, a new web socket implementation was introduced for users running iOS 13 or higher. This new websocket implementation is not configured to enforce certificate pinning when available. Certificate pinning for the new websocket is enforced in version 3.84 or above.

### CVSS Score: **4**
