# CVE-2021-23803

This affects the package latte/latte before 2.10.6. There is a way to bypass allowFunctions that will affect the security of the application. When the template is set to allow/disallow the use of certain functions, adding control characters (x00-x08) after the function will bypass these restrictions.
