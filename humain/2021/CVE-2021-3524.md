# CVE-2021-3524

- Published: 2021-05-17T17:15:00

- Modified: 2022-10-27T12:38:00

A flaw was found in the Red Hat Ceph Storage RadosGW (Ceph Object Gateway) in versions before 14.2.21. The vulnerability is related to the injection of HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader tag. The newline character in the ExposeHeader tag in the CORS configuration file generates a header injection in the response when the CORS request is made. In addition, the prior bug fix for CVE-2020-10753 did not account for the use of \r as a header separator, thus a new flaw has been created.
