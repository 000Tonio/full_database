Seceon aiSIEM before 6.3.2 (build 585) is prone to an unauthenticated account takeover vulnerability in the Forgot Password feature. The lack of correct configuration leads to recovery of the password reset link generated via the password reset functionality, and thus an unauthenticated attacker can set an arbitrary password for any user.
