Autodesk Licensing Installer was found to be vulnerable to privilege escalation issues. A malicious user with limited privileges could run any number of tools on a system to identify services that are configured with weak permissions and are running under elevated privileges. These weak permissions could allow all users on the operating system to modify the service configuration and take ownership of the service.
