In GoCD, versions 19.6.0 to 21.1.0 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery due to missing CSRF protection at the `/go/api/config/backup` endpoint. An attacker can trick a victim to click on a malicious link which could change backup configurations or execute system commands in the post_backup_script field.
