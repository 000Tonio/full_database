ETINET BACKBOX E4.09 and H4.09 mismanages password access control. When a user uses the User ID of the process running BBSV to login to the Backbox UI application, the system procedure (USER_AUTHENTICATE_) used for verifying the Password returns 0 (no error). The reason is that the user is not running the XYGate application. Hence, BBSV assumes the Password is correct. For H4.09, the affected version isT0954V04^AAO. For E4.09, the affected version is 22SEP2020. Note: If your current version is E4.10-16MAY2021 (version procedure T9999V04_16MAY2022_BPAKETI_10), a hotfix (FIXPAK-19OCT-2022) is available in version E4.10-19OCT2022. Resolution to CVE-2021-33895 in version E4.11-19OCT2022
