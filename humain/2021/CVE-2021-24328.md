# CVE-2021-24328

- Published: 2021-06-01T14:15:00

- Modified: 2022-07-29T16:18:00

The WP Login Security and History WordPress plugin through 1.0 did not have CSRF check when saving its settings, not any sanitisation or validation on them. This could allow attackers to make logged in administrators change the plugin's settings to arbitrary values, and set XSS payloads on them as well

### CVSS Score: **3.5**
