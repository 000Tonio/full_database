# CVE-2021-4380

- Published: 2023-06-07T13:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-07T14:35:00

The Pinterest Automatic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to missing capability checks on the 'wp_pinterest_automatic_parse_request' function and the 'process_form.php' script in versions up to, and including, 1.14.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update arbitrary options on a site that can be used to create new administrative user accounts or redirect unsuspecting site visitors.

### CVSS Score: **null**
