# CVE-2021-3939

- Published: 2021-11-17T04:15:00

- Modified: 2021-11-19T16:30:00

Ubuntu-specific modifications to accountsservice (in patch file debian/patches/0010-set-language.patch) caused the fallback_locale variable, pointing to static storage, to be freed, in the user_change_language_authorized_cb function. This is reachable via the SetLanguage dbus function. This is fixed in versions 0.6.55-0ubuntu12~20.04.5, 0.6.55-0ubuntu13.3, 0.6.55-0ubuntu14.1.
