The User Registration WordPress plugin before 2.0.2 does not properly sanitise the user_registration_profile_pic_url value when submitted directly via the user_registration_update_profile_details AJAX action. This could allow any authenticated user, such as subscriber, to perform Stored Cross-Site attacks when their profile is viewed

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
