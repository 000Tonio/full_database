golang.org/x/text/language in golang.org/x/text before 0.3.7 can panic with an out-of-bounds read during BCP 47 language tag parsing. Index calculation is mishandled. If parsing untrusted user input, this can be used as a vector for a denial-of-service attack.

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
