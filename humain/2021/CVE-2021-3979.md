# CVE-2021-3979

- Published: 2022-08-25T20:15:00

- Modified: 2023-02-12T23:42:00

A key length flaw was found in Red Hat Ceph Storage. An attacker can exploit the fact that the key length is incorrectly passed in an encryption algorithm to create a non random key, which is weaker and can be exploited for loss of confidentiality and integrity on encrypted disks.
