In the Reponsive Menu (free and Pro) WordPress plugins before 4.0.4, attackers could craft a request and trick an administrator into importing all new settings. These settings could be modified to include malicious JavaScript, therefore allowing an attacker to inject payloads that could aid in further infection of the site.
