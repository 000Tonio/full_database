** DISPUTED ** The Telegram app 7.6.2 for iOS allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (application crash) if the victim pastes an attacker-supplied message (e.g., in the Persian language) into a channel or group. The crash occurs in MtProtoKitFramework. NOTE: the vendor's perspective is that "this behavior can't be considered a vulnerability."
