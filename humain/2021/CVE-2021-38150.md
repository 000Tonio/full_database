When an attacker manages to get access to the local memory, or the memory dump of a victim, for example by a social engineering attack, SAP Business Client versions - 7.0, 7.70, will allow him to read extremely sensitive data, such as credentials. This would allow the attacker to compromise the corresponding backend for which the credentials are valid.
