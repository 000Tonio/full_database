# CVE-2021-34558

- Published: 2021-07-15T14:15:00

- Modified: 2022-08-04T20:00:00

The crypto/tls package of Go through 1.16.5 does not properly assert that the type of public key in an X.509 certificate matches the expected type when doing a RSA based key exchange, allowing a malicious TLS server to cause a TLS client to panic.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
