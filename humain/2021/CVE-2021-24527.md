The User Registration & User Profile â€“ Profile Builder WordPress plugin before 3.4.9 has a bug allowing any user to reset the password of the admin of the blog, and gain unauthorised access, due to a bypass in the way the reset key is checked. Furthermore, the admin will not be notified of such change by email for example.
