An issue was discovered in Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central before 100251. By leveraging access to a log file, a context-dependent attacker can obtain (depending on the modules configured) the Base64 encoded Password/Username of AD accounts, the cleartext Password/Username and mail settings of the EAS account (an AD account used to send mail), the cleartext password of recovery_password of Android devices, the cleartext password of account "set", the location of devices enrolled in the platform (with UUID and information related to the name of the person at the location), critical information about all enrolled devices such as Serial Number, UUID, Model, Name, and auth_session_token (usable to spoof a terminal identity on the platform), etc.
