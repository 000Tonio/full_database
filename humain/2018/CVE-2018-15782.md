The Quick Setup component of RSA Authentication Manager versions prior to 8.4 is vulnerable to a relative path traversal vulnerability. A local attacker could potentially provide an administrator with a crafted license that if used during the quick setup deployment of the initial RSA Authentication Manager system, could allow the attacker unauthorized access to that system.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**
