# CVE-2018-16976

- Published: 2018-09-12T22:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-03T00:03:00

Gitolite before 3.6.9 does not (in certain configurations involving @all or a regex) properly restrict access to a Git repository that is in the process of being migrated until the full set of migration steps has been completed. This can allow valid users to obtain unintended access.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
