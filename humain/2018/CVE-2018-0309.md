# CVE-2018-0309

- Published: 2018-06-21T11:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-09T23:31:00

A vulnerability in the implementation of a specific CLI command and the associated Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) MIB for Cisco NX-OS (in standalone NX-OS mode) on Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 Series Switches could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to exhaust system memory on an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to the incorrect implementation of the CLI command, resulting in a failure to free all allocated memory upon completion. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the affected device and repeatedly issuing a specific CLI command or sending a specific SNMP poll request for a specific Object Identifier (OID). A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the IP routing process to restart or to cause a device reset, resulting in a DoS condition. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf23136.
