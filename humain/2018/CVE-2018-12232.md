# CVE-2018-12232

- Published: 2018-06-12T12:29:00

In net/socket.c in the Linux kernel through 4.17.1, there is a race condition between fchownat and close in cases where they target the same socket file descriptor, related to the sock_close and sockfs_setattr functions. fchownat does not increment the file descriptor reference count, which allows close to set the socket to NULL during fchownat's execution, leading to a NULL pointer dereference and system crash.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
