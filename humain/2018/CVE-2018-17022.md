# CVE-2018-17022

- Published: 2018-09-13T19:29:00

Stack-based buffer overflow on the ASUS GT-AC5300 router through 3.0.0.4.384_32738 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by setting a long sh_path0 value and then sending an appGet.cgi?hook=select_list("Storage_x_SharedPath") request, because ej_select_list in router/httpd/web.c uses strcpy.
