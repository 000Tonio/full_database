When receiving calls using WhatsApp on Android, a stack allocation failed to properly account for the amount of data being passed in. An off-by-one error meant that data was written beyond the allocated space on the stack. This issue affects WhatsApp for Android starting in version 2.18.180 and was fixed in version 2.18.295. It also affects WhatsApp Business for Android starting in version v2.18.103 and was fixed in version v2.18.150.
