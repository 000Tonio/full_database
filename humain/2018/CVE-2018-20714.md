The logging system of the Automattic WooCommerce plugin before 3.4.6 for WordPress is vulnerable to a File Deletion vulnerability. This allows deletion of woocommerce.php, which leads to certain privilege checks not being in place, and therefore a shop manager can escalate privileges to admin.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**
