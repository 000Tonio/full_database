** DISPUTED *** Lack of authentication in Citrix Xen Mobile through 10.8 allows low-privileged local users to execute system commands as root by making requests to private services listening on ports 8000, 30000 and 30001.  NOTE: the vendor disputes that this is a vulnerability, stating it is "already mitigated by the internal firewall that limits access to configuration services to localhost."

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
