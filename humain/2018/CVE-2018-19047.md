** DISPUTED ** mPDF through 7.1.6, if deployed as a web application that accepts arbitrary HTML, allows SSRF, as demonstrated by a '<img src="http://192.168' substring that triggers a call to getImage in Image/ImageProcessor.php. NOTE: the software maintainer disputes this, stating "If you allow users to pass HTML without sanitising it, you're asking for trouble."

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
