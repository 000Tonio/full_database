Infinispan permits improper deserialization of trusted data via XML and JSON transcoders under certain server configurations. A user with authenticated access to the server could send a malicious object to a cache configured to accept certain types of objects, achieving code execution and possible further attacks. Versions 9.0.3.Final, 9.1.7.Final, 8.2.10.Final, 9.2.2.Final, 9.3.0.Alpha1 are believed to be affected.
