# CVE-2018-6594

- Published: 2018-02-03T15:29:00

- Modified: 2020-07-31T19:15:00

lib/Crypto/PublicKey/ElGamal.py in PyCrypto through 2.6.1 generates weak ElGamal key parameters, which allows attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading ciphertext data (i.e., it does not have semantic security in face of a ciphertext-only attack). The Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption does not hold for PyCrypto's ElGamal implementation.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
