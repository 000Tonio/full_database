# CVE-2018-1095

- Published: 2018-04-02T03:29:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:53:00

The ext4_xattr_check_entries function in fs/ext4/xattr.c in the Linux kernel through 4.15.15 does not properly validate xattr sizes, which causes misinterpretation of a size as an error code, and consequently allows attackers to cause a denial of service (get_acl NULL pointer dereference and system crash) via a crafted ext4 image.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
