# CVE-2018-1120

- Published: 2018-06-20T13:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-09T23:38:00

A flaw was found affecting the Linux kernel before version 4.17. By mmap()ing a FUSE-backed file onto a process's memory containing command line arguments (or environment strings), an attacker can cause utilities from psutils or procps (such as ps, w) or any other program which makes a read() call to the /proc/<pid>/cmdline (or /proc/<pid>/environ) files to block indefinitely (denial of service) or for some controlled time (as a synchronization primitive for other attacks).

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
