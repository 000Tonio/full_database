The ASUS ZenFone 3 Max Android device with a build fingerprint of asus/US_Phone/ASUS_X008_1:7.0/NRD90M/US_Phone-14.14.1711.92-20171208:user/release-keys contains a pre-installed platform app with a package name of com.asus.dm (versionCode=1510500200, versionName=1.5.0.40_171122) has an exposed interface in an exported service named com.asus.dm.installer.DMInstallerService that allows any app co-located on the device to use its capabilities to download an arbitrary app over the internet and install it. Any app on the device can send an intent with specific embedded data that will cause the com.asus.dm app to programmatically download and install the app. For the app to be downloaded and installed, certain data needs to be provided: download URL, package name, version name from the app's AndroidManifest.xml file, and the MD5 hash of the app. Moreover, any app that is installed using this method can also be programmatically uninstalled using the same unprotected component named com.asus.dm.installer.DMInstallerService.
