An issue was discovered in MicroStrategy Web Services (the Microsoft Office plugin) before 10.4 Hotfix 7, and before 10.11. The vulnerability is unauthenticated and leads to access to the asset files with the MicroStrategy user privileges. (This includes the credentials to access the admin dashboard which may lead to RCE.) The path traversal is located in a SOAP request in the web service component.
