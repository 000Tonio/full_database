A vulnerability was discovered in all versions of Medtronic MyCareLink 24950 and 24952 Patient Monitor. The affected product's update service does not sufficiently verify the authenticity of the data uploaded. An attacker who obtains per-product credentials from the monitor and paired implantable cardiac device information can potentially upload invalid data to the Medtronic CareLink network.
