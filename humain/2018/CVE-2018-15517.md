The MailConnect feature on D-Link Central WiFiManager CWM-100 1.03 r0098 devices is intended to check a connection to an SMTP server but actually allows outbound TCP to any port on any IP address, leading to SSRF, as demonstrated by an index.php/System/MailConnect/host/127.0.0.1/port/22/secure/ URI.
