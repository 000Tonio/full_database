# CVE-2018-14767

- Published: 2018-07-31T06:29:00

In Kamailio before 5.0.7 and 5.1.x before 5.1.4, a crafted SIP message with a double "To" header and an empty "To" tag causes a segmentation fault and crash. The reason is missing input validation in the "build_res_buf_from_sip_req" core function. This could result in denial of service and potentially the execution of arbitrary code.
