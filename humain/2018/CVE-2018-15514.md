# CVE-2018-15514

- Published: 2018-09-01T01:29:00

HandleRequestAsync in Docker for Windows before 18.06.0-ce-rc3-win68 (edge) and before 18.06.0-ce-win72 (stable) deserialized requests over the \\.\pipe\dockerBackend named pipe without verifying the validity of the deserialized .NET objects. This would allow a malicious user in the "docker-users" group (who may not otherwise have administrator access) to escalate to administrator privileges.
