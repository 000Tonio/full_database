A buffer overflow vulnerability in the DHCP and PPPOE configuration interface of the Auerswald COMfort 1200 IP phone 3.4.4.1-10589 allows a remote attacker (authenticated as simple user in the same network as the device) to trigger remote code execution via a POST request (ManufacturerName parameter) to the web server on the device. The web server is running with root privileges and the injected code will also run with root privileges.
