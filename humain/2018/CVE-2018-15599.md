# CVE-2018-15599

- Published: 2018-08-21T01:29:00

- Modified: 2020-12-30T20:15:00

The recv_msg_userauth_request function in svr-auth.c in Dropbear through 2018.76 is prone to a user enumeration vulnerability because username validity affects how fields in SSH_MSG_USERAUTH messages are handled, a similar issue to CVE-2018-15473 in an unrelated codebase.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |

| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
