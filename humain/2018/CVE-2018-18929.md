The Tightrope Media Carousel Seneca HDn Windows-based appliance 7.0.4.104 is shipped with a default local administrator username and password. This can be found by a limited user account in an "unattend.xml" file left over on the C: drive from the Sysprep process. An attacker with this username and password can leverage it to gain administrator-level access on the system.

### CVSS Score: **4**
