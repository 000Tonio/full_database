The forgotten-password feature in index.php/member/reset/reset_email.html in YzmCMS v3.2 through v3.7 has a Response Discrepancy Information Exposure issue and an unexpectedly long lifetime for a verification code, which makes it easier for remote attackers to hijack accounts via a brute-force approach.
