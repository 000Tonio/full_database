RSA Identity Lifecycle and Governance versions 7.0.1, 7.0.2 and 7.1.0 contains an authorization bypass vulnerability within the workflow architect component (ACM). A remote authenticated malicious user with non-admin privileges could potentially bypass the Java Security Policies. Once bypassed, a malicious user could potentially run arbitrary system commands at the OS level with application owner privileges on the affected system.
