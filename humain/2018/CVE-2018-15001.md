The Vivo V7 Android device with a build fingerprint of vivo/1718/1718:7.1.2/N2G47H/compil11021857:user/release-keys contains a platform app with a package name of com.vivo.bsptest (versionCode=1, versionName=1.0) containing an exported activity app component named com.vivo.bsptest.BSPTestActivity that allows any app co-located on the device to initiate the writing of the logcat log, bluetooth log, and kernel log to external storage. When logging is enabled, there is a notification in the status bar, so it is not completely transparent to the user. The user can cancel the logging, but it can be re-enabled since the app with a package name of com.vivo.bsptest cannot be disabled. The writing of these logs can be initiated by an app co-located on the device, although the READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission is necessary to for an app to access the log files.
