An exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the HTTP header-parsing function of the Webroot BrightCloud SDK. The function bc_http_read_header incorrectly handles overlong headers, leading to arbitrary code execution. An unauthenticated attacker could impersonate a remote BrightCloud server to trigger this vulnerability.
