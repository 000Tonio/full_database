Grafana 2.x, 3.x, and 4.x before 4.6.4 and 5.x before 5.2.3 allows authentication bypass because an attacker can generate a valid "remember me" cookie knowing only a username of an LDAP or OAuth user.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
