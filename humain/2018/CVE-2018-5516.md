On F5 BIG-IP 13.0.0-13.1.0.5, 12.1.0-12.1.2, or 11.2.1-11.6.3.1, Enterprise Manager 3.1.1, BIG-IQ Centralized Management 5.0.0-5.4.0 or 4.6.0, BIG-IQ Cloud and Orchestration 1.0.0, or F5 iWorkflow 2.0.2-2.3.0, authenticated users granted TMOS Shell (tmsh) access can access objects on the file system which would normally be disallowed by tmsh restrictions. This allows for authenticated, low privileged attackers to exfiltrate objects on the file system which should not be allowed.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
