** DISPUTED ** zb_system/function/lib/upload.php in Z-BlogPHP through 1.5.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by using the image/jpeg content type in an upload to the zb_system/admin/index.php?act=UploadMng URI. NOTE: The vendor's position is "We have no dynamic including. No one can run PHP by uploading an image in current version." It also requires authentication.
