Bluetooth firmware or operating system software drivers in macOS versions before 10.13, High Sierra and iOS versions before 11.4, and Android versions before the 2018-06-05 patch may not sufficiently validate elliptic curve parameters used to generate public keys during a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which may allow a remote attacker to obtain the encryption key used by the device.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
