HisiPHP 1.0.8 allows CSRF via admin.php/admin/user/adduser.html to add an administrator account. The attacker can then use that account to execute arbitrary PHP code by leveraging app/common/model/AdminAnnex.php to add .php to the default list of allowable file-upload types (.jpg, .png, .gif, .jpeg, and .ico).
