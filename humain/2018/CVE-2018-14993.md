The ASUS Zenfone V Live Android device with a build fingerprint of asus/VZW_ASUS_A009/ASUS_A009:7.1.1/NMF26F/14.0610.1802.78-20180313:user/release-keys and the Asus ZenFone 3 Max Android device with a build fingerprint of asus/US_Phone/ASUS_X008_1:7.0/NRD90M/US_Phone-14.14.1711.92-20171208:user/release-keys both contain a pre-installed platform app with a package name of com.asus.splendidcommandagent (versionCode=1510200090, versionName=1.2.0.18_160928) that contains an exported service named com.asus.splendidcommandagent.SplendidCommandAgentService that allows any app co-located on the device to supply arbitrary commands to be executed as the system user. This app cannot be disabled by the user and the attack can be performed by a zero-permission app. Executing commands as system user can allow a third-party app to video record the user's screen, factory reset the device, obtain the user's notifications, read the logcat logs, inject events in the Graphical User Interface (GUI), change the default Input Method Editor (IME) (e.g., keyboard) with one contained within the attacking app that contains keylogging functionality, obtain the user's text messages, and more.
