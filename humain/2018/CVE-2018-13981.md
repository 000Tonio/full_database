# CVE-2018-13981

- Published: 2018-07-16T14:29:00

The websites that were built from Zeta Producer Desktop CMS before 14.2.1 are vulnerable to unauthenticated remote code execution due to a default component that permits arbitrary upload of PHP files, because the formmailer widget blocks .php files but not .php5 or .phtml files. This is related to /assets/php/formmailer/SendEmail.php and /assets/php/formmailer/functions.php.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
