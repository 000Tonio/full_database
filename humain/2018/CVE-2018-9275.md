In check_user_token in util.c in the Yubico PAM module (aka pam_yubico) 2.18 through 2.25, successful logins can leak file descriptors to the auth mapping file, which can lead to information disclosure (serial number of a device) and/or DoS (reaching the maximum number of file descriptors).

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | PARTIAL |
