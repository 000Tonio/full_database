# CVE-2018-20799

- Published: 2019-03-01T15:29:00

In pfSense 2.4.4_1, blocking of source IP addresses on the basis of failed HTTPS authentication is inconsistent with blocking of source IP addresses on the basis of failed SSH authentication (the behavior does not match the sshguard documentation), which might make it easier for attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
