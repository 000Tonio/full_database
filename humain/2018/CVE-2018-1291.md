Apache Fineract 1.0.0, 0.6.0-incubating, 0.5.0-incubating, 0.4.0-incubating exposes different REST end points to query domain specific entities with a Query Parameter 'orderBy' which are appended directly with SQL statements. A hacker/user can inject/draft the 'orderBy' query parameter by way of the "order" param in such a way to read/update the data for which he doesn't have authorization.
