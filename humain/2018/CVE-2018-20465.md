- Published: 2018-12-25T23:29:00

Craft CMS through 3.0.34 allows remote authenticated administrators to read sensitive information via server-side template injection, as demonstrated by a {% string for craft.app.config.DB.user and craft.app.config.DB.password in the URI Format of the Site Settings, which causes a cleartext username and password to be displayed in a URI field.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
