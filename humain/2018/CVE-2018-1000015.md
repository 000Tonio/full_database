# CVE-2018-1000015

- Published: 2018-01-23T14:29:00

On Jenkins instances with Authorize Project plugin, the authentication associated with a build may lack the Computer/Build permission on some agents. This did not prevent the execution of Pipeline `node` blocks on those agents due to incorrect permissions checks in Pipeline: Nodes and Processes plugin 2.17 and earlier.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
