# CVE-2018-19413

- Published: 2018-12-14T15:29:00

A vulnerability in the API of SonarSource SonarQube before 7.4 could allow an authenticated user to discover sensitive information such as valid user-account logins in the web application. The vulnerability occurs because of improperly configured access controls that cause the API to return the externalIdentity field to non-administrator users. The attacker could use this information in subsequent attacks against the system.

### CVSS Score: **4**
