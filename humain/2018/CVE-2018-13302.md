In FFmpeg 4.0.1, improper handling of frame types (other than EAC3_FRAME_TYPE_INDEPENDENT) that have multiple independent substreams in the handle_eac3 function in libavformat/movenc.c may trigger an out-of-array access while converting a crafted AVI file to MPEG4, leading to a denial of service or possibly unspecified other impact.
