An issue was discovered in several Bosch Smart Home cameras (360 degree indoor camera and Eyes outdoor camera) with firmware before 6.52.4. A malicious client could potentially succeed in the unauthorized execution of code on the device via the network interface, because there is a buffer overflow in the RCP+ parser of the web server.
