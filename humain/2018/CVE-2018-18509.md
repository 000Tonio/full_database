A flaw during verification of certain S/MIME signatures causes emails to be shown in Thunderbird as having a valid digital signature, even if the shown message contents aren't covered by the signature. The flaw allows an attacker to reuse a valid S/MIME signature to craft an email message with arbitrary content. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 60.5.1.
