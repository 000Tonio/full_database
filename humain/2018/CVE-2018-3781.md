A missing sanitization of search results for an autocomplete field in NextCloud Talk <3.2.5 could lead to a stored XSS requiring user-interaction. The missing sanitization only affected user names, hence malicious search results could only be crafted by authenticated users.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
