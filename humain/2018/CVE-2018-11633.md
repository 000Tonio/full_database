An issue was discovered in the MULTIDOTS Woo Checkout for Digital Goods plugin 2.1 for WordPress. If an admin user can be tricked into visiting a crafted URL created by an attacker (via spear phishing/social engineering), the attacker can change the plugin settings. The function woo_checkout_settings_page in the file class-woo-checkout-for-digital-goods-admin.php doesn't do any check against wp-admin/admin-post.php Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) and user capabilities.
