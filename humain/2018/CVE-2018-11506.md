# CVE-2018-11506

- Published: 2018-05-28T04:29:00

- Modified: 2020-08-24T17:37:00

The sr_do_ioctl function in drivers/scsi/sr_ioctl.c in the Linux kernel through 4.16.12 allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact because sense buffers have different sizes at the CDROM layer and the SCSI layer, as demonstrated by a CDROMREADMODE2 ioctl call.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**
