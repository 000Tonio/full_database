# CVE-2018-16132

- Published: 2018-08-29T22:29:00

- Modified: 2018-11-08T19:45:00

The image rendering component (createGenericPreview) of the Open Whisper Signal app through 2.29.0 for iOS fails to check for unreasonably large images before manipulating received images. This allows for a large image sent to a user to exhaust all available memory when the image is displayed, resulting in a forced restart of the device.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
