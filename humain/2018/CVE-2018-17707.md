The specific flaw exists within the handler for the com.epicgames.launcher protocol. A crafted URI with the com.epicgames.launcher protocol can trigger execution of a system call composed from a user-supplied string. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current user. Was ZDI-CAN-7241.
