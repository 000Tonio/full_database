** DISPUTED ** cryptlib through 3.4.4 allows a memory-cache side-channel attack on DSA and ECDSA signatures, aka the Return Of the Hidden Number Problem or ROHNP. To discover a key, the attacker needs access to either the local machine or a different virtual machine on the same physical host. NOTE: the vendor does not include side-channel attacks within its threat model.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**
