In Pydio before 8.2.2, an attack is possible via PHP Object Injection because a user is allowed to use the $phpserial$a:0:{} syntax to store a preference. An attacker either needs a "public link" of a file, or access to any unprivileged user account for creation of such a link.

### CVSS Score: **10**
