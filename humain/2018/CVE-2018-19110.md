# CVE-2018-19110

- Published: 2018-11-08T08:29:00

- Modified: 2020-08-24T17:37:00

The skin-management feature in tianti 2.3 allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended permission restrictions by visiting tianti-module-admin/user/skin/list directly because controller\usercontroller.java maps a /skin/list request to the function skinList, and lacks an authorization check.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
