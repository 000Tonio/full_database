# CVE-2018-20839

- Published: 2019-05-17T04:29:00

- Modified: 2022-02-20T06:10:00

systemd 242 changes the VT1 mode upon a logout, which allows attackers to read cleartext passwords in certain circumstances, such as watching a shutdown, or using Ctrl-Alt-F1 and Ctrl-Alt-F2. This occurs because the KDGKBMODE (aka current keyboard mode) check is mishandled.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
