The pkgmgr system service in Tizen allows an unprivileged process to perform package management actions, due to improper D-Bus security policy configurations. Such actions include installing, decrypting, and killing other packages. This affects Tizen before 5.0 M1, and Tizen-based firmwares including Samsung Galaxy Gear series before build RE2.
