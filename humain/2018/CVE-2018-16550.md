- Published: 2018-09-05T22:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-03T00:03:00

TeamViewer 10.x through 13.x allows remote attackers to bypass the brute-force authentication protection mechanism by skipping the "Cancel" step, which makes it easier to determine the correct value of the default 4-digit PIN.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
