# CVE-2018-14650

- Published: 2018-09-27T20:29:00

It was discovered that sos-collector does not properly set the default permissions of newly created files, making all files created by the tool readable by any local user. A local attacker may use this flaw by waiting for a legit user to run sos-collector and steal the collected data in the /var/tmp directory.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**
