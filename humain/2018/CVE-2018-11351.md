script.php in Jirafeau before 3.4.1 is affected by two stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. These are stored within the shared files description file and allow the execution of a JavaScript payload each time an administrator searches or lists uploaded files. These two injections could be triggered without authentication, and target the administrator. The attack vectors are the Content-Type field and the filename parameter.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
