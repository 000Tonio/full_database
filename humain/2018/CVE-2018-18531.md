text/impl/DefaultTextCreator.java, text/impl/ChineseTextProducer.java, and text/impl/FiveLetterFirstNameTextCreator.java in kaptcha 2.3.2 use the Random (rather than SecureRandom) function for generating CAPTCHA values, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a brute-force approach.

### CVSS Score: **5**
