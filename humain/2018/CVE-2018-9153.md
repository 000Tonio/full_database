The plugin upload component in Z-BlogPHP 1.5.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via the app_id parameter to zb_users/plugin/AppCentre/plugin_edit.php because of an unanchored regular expression, a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-8893. The component must be accessed directly by an administrator, or through CSRF.
