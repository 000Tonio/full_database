RSA Authentication Manager versions prior to 8.3 P3 contain a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the Operations Console. A malicious Operations Console administrator could exploit this vulnerability to store arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code through the web interface. When other Operations Console administrators open the affected page, the injected scripts could potentially be executed in their browser.
