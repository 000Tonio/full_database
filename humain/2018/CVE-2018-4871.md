An Out-of-bounds Read issue was discovered in Adobe Flash Player before 28.0.0.137. This vulnerability occurs because of computation that reads data that is past the end of the target buffer. The use of an invalid (out-of-range) pointer offset during access of internal data structure fields causes the vulnerability. A successful attack can lead to sensitive data exposure.
