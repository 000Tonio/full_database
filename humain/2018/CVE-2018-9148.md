Western Digital WD My Cloud v04.05.00-320 devices embed the session token (aka PHPSESSID) in filenames, which makes it easier for attackers to bypass authentication by listing a directory. NOTE: this can be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2018-7171 for remote authentication bypass within a product that uses My Cloud.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
