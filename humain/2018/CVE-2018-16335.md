newoffsets handling in ChopUpSingleUncompressedStrip in tif_dirread.c in LibTIFF 4.0.9 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted TIFF file, as demonstrated by tiff2pdf. This is a different vulnerability than CVE-2018-15209.
