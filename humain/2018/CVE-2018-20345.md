Incorrect access control in StackStorm API (st2api) in StackStorm before 2.9.2 and 2.10.x before 2.10.1 allows an attacker (who has a StackStorm account and is authenticated against the StackStorm API) to retrieve datastore items for other users by utilizing the /v1/keys "?scope=all" and "?user=<username>" query filter parameters. Enterprise editions with RBAC enabled are not affected.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
