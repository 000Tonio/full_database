# CVE-2018-7187

- Published: 2018-02-16T17:29:00

- Modified: 2022-08-16T13:01:00

The "go get" implementation in Go 1.9.4, when the -insecure command-line option is used, does not validate the import path (get/vcs.go only checks for "://" anywhere in the string), which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted web site.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
