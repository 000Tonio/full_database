private_address_check ruby gem before 0.5.0 is vulnerable to a time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition due to the address the socket uses not being checked. DNS entries with a TTL of 0 can trigger this case where the initial resolution is a public address but the subsequent resolution is a private address.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
