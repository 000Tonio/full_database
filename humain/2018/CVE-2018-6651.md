# CVE-2018-6651

- Published: 2018-02-05T22:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-09T23:41:00

In the uncurl_ws_accept function in uncurl.c in uncurl before 0.07, as used in Parsec before 140-3, insufficient Origin header validation (accepting an arbitrary substring match) for WebSocket API requests allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions. In Parsec, this means full control over the victim's computer.
