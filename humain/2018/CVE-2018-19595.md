PbootCMS V1.3.1 build 2018-11-14 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via use of "eval" with mixed case, as demonstrated by an index.php/list/5/?current={pboot:if(evAl($_GET[a]))}1{/pboot:if}&a=phpinfo(); URI, because of an incorrect apps\home\controller\ParserController.php parserIfLabel protection mechanism.
