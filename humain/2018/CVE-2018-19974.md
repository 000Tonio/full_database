- Published: 2018-12-17T19:29:00

- Modified: 2020-08-24T17:37:00

In YARA 3.8.1, bytecode in a specially crafted compiled rule can read uninitialized data from VM scratch memory in libyara/exec.c. This can allow attackers to discover addresses in the real stack (not the YARA virtual stack).

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
