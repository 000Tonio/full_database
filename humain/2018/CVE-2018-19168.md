Shell Metacharacter Injection in www/modules/save.php in FruityWifi (aka PatatasFritas/PatataWifi) through 2.4 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code with root privileges via a crafted mod_name parameter in a POST request. NOTE: unlike in CVE-2018-17317, the attacker does not need a valid session.
