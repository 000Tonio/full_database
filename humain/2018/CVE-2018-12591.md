Ubiquiti Networks EdgeSwitch version 1.7.3 and prior suffer from an improperly neutralized element in an OS command due to lack of protection on the admin CLI, leading to code execution and privilege escalation greater than administrators themselves are allowed. An attacker with access to an admin account could escape the restricted CLI and execute arbitrary shell instructions.

### CVSS Score: **9**
