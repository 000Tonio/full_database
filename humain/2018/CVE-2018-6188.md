django.contrib.auth.forms.AuthenticationForm in Django 2.0 before 2.0.2, and 1.11.8 and 1.11.9, allows remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information by leveraging data exposure from the confirm_login_allowed() method, as demonstrated by discovering whether a user account is inactive.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
