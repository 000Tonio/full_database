# CVE-2018-12384

- Published: 2019-04-29T15:29:00

- Modified: 2020-08-24T17:37:00

When handling a SSLv2-compatible ClientHello request, the server doesn't generate a new random value but sends an all-zero value instead. This results in full malleability of the ClientHello for SSLv2 used for TLS 1.2 in all versions prior to NSS 3.39. This does not impact TLS 1.3.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
