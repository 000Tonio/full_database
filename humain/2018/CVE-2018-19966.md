An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x allowing x86 PV guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly gain host OS privileges because of an interpretation conflict for a union data structure associated with shadow paging. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2017-15595.
