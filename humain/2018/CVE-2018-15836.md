# CVE-2018-15836

- Published: 2018-09-26T21:29:00

- Modified: 2019-01-10T17:52:00

In verify_signed_hash() in lib/liboswkeys/signatures.c in Openswan before 2.6.50.1, the RSA implementation does not verify the value of padding string during PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification. Consequently, a remote attacker can forge signatures when small public exponents are being used. IKEv2 signature verification is affected when RAW RSA keys are used.

### CVSS Score: **5**
