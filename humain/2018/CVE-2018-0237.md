A vulnerability in the file type detection mechanism of the Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Endpoints macOS Connector could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass malware detection. The vulnerability occurs because the software relies on only the file extension for detecting DMG files. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a DMG file with a nonstandard extension to a device that is running an affected AMP for Endpoints macOS Connector. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured malware detection. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCve34034.
