# CVE-2018-6011

- Published: 2018-11-01T17:29:00

- Modified: 2020-08-24T17:37:00

The time-based one-time-password (TOTP) function in the application logic of the Green Electronics RainMachine Mini-8 (2nd generation) uses the administrator's password hash to generate a 6-digit temporary passcode that can be used for remote and local access, aka a "Use of Password Hash Instead of Password for Authentication" issue. This is exploitable by an attacker who discovers a hash value in the rainmachine-settings.sqlite file.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
