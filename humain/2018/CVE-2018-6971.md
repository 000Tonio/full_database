VMware Horizon View Agents (7.x.x before 7.5.1) contain a local information disclosure vulnerability due to insecure logging of credentials in the vmmsi.log file when an account other than the currently logged on user is specified during installation (including silent installations). Successful exploitation of this issue may allow low privileged users access to the credentials specified during the Horizon View Agent installation.
