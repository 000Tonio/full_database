In all android releases (Android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, QRD Android) from CAF using the linux kernel, while processing SET_PASSPOINT_LIST vendor command HDD does not make sure that the realm string that gets passed by upper-layer is NULL terminated. This may lead to buffer overflow as strlen is used to get realm string length to construct the PASSPOINT WMA command.
