# CVE-2018-0495

- Published: 2018-06-13T23:29:00

- Modified: 2020-08-24T17:37:00

Libgcrypt before 1.7.10 and 1.8.x before 1.8.3 allows a memory-cache side-channel attack on ECDSA signatures that can be mitigated through the use of blinding during the signing process in the _gcry_ecc_ecdsa_sign function in cipher/ecc-ecdsa.c, aka the Return Of the Hidden Number Problem or ROHNP. To discover an ECDSA key, the attacker needs access to either the local machine or a different virtual machine on the same physical host.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
