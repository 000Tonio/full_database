# CVE-2018-7756

- Published: 2018-03-15T01:29:00

- Modified: 2018-04-12T13:17:00

RunExeFile.exe in the installer for DEWESoft X3 SP1 (64-bit) devices does not require authentication for sessions on TCP port 1999, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or access internal commands, as demonstrated by a RUN command that launches a .EXE file located at an arbitrary external URL, or a "SETFIREWALL Off" command.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
