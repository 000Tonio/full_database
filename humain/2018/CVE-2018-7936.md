Mate 10 Pro Huawei smart phones with the versions before BLA-L29 8.0.0.148(C432) have a Factory Reset Protection (FRP) bypass security vulnerability. When re-configuring the mobile phone using the factory reset protection (FRP) function, an attacker can connect the phone with PC and send special instructions to install third party desktop and disable the boot wizard.
