Deltek Vision 7.x before 7.6 permits the execution of any attacker supplied SQL statement through a custom RPC over HTTP protocol. The Vision system relies on the client binary to enforce security rules and integrity of SQL statements and other content being sent to the server. Client HTTP calls can be manipulated by one of several means to execute arbitrary SQL statements (similar to SQLi) or possibly have unspecified other impact via this custom protocol. To perform these attacks an authenticated session is first required. In some cases client calls are obfuscated by encryption, which can be bypassed due to hard-coded keys and an insecure key rotation protocol. Impacts may include remote code execution in some deployments; however, the vendor states that this cannot occur when the installation documentation is heeded.
