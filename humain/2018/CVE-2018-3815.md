# CVE-2018-3815

- Published: 2018-01-08T05:29:00

The "XML Interface to Messaging, Scheduling, and Signaling" (XIMSS) protocol implementation in CommuniGate Pro (CGP) 6.2 suffers from a Missing XIMSS Protocol Validation attack that leads to an email spoofing attack, allowing a malicious authenticated attacker to send a message from any source email address. The attack uses an HTTP POST request to a /Session URI, and interchanges the XML From and To elements.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
