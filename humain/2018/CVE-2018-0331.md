A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol (formerly known as CDP) subsystem of devices running, or based on, Cisco NX-OS Software contain a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to create a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly validate certain fields within a Cisco Discovery Protocol message prior to processing it. An attacker with the ability to submit a Cisco Discovery Protocol message designed to trigger the issue could cause a DoS condition on an affected device while the device restarts. This vulnerability affects Firepower 4100 Series Next-Generation Firewall, Firepower 9300 Security Appliance, MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Director Switches, Nexus 1000V Series Switches, Nexus 1100 Series Cloud Services Platforms, Nexus 2000 Series Switches, Nexus 3000 Series Switches, Nexus 3500 Platform Switches, Nexus 3600 Platform Switches, Nexus 5500 Platform Switches, Nexus 5600 Platform Switches, Nexus 6000 Series Switches, Nexus 7000 Series Switches, Nexus 7700 Series Switches, Nexus 9000 Series Switches in NX-OS mode, Nexus 9500 R-Series Line Cards and Fabric Modules, UCS 6100 Series Fabric Interconnects, UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects, UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects.
