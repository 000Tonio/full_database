An exploitable cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in the ACEManager ping_result.cgi functionality of Sierra Wireless AirLink ES450 FW 4.9.3. A specially crafted HTTP ping request can cause reflected javascript code execution, resulting in the execution of javascript code running on the victim's browser. An attacker can get a victim to click a link, or embedded URL, that redirects to the reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability to trigger this vulnerability.
