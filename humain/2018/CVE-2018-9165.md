# CVE-2018-9165

- Published: 2018-04-01T18:29:00

- Modified: 2018-05-15T15:35:00

The pushdup function in util/decompile.c in libming through 0.4.8 does not recognize the need for ActionPushDuplicate to perform a deep copy when a String is at the top of the stack, making the library vulnerable to a util/decompile.c getName NULL pointer dereference, which may allow attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted SWF file.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
