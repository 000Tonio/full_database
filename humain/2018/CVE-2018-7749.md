- Modified: 2019-03-04T19:16:00

The SSH server implementation of AsyncSSH before 1.12.1 does not properly check whether authentication is completed before processing other requests. A customized SSH client can simply skip the authentication step.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
