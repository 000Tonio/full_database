A vulnerability in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) ingress packet processing of Cisco Unified IP Phone software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a lack of flow-control mechanisms in the software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending high volumes of SIP INVITE traffic to the targeted device. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to cause a disruption of services on the targeted IP phone.
