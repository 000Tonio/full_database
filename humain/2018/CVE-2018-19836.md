In Metinfo 6.1.3, include/interface/applogin.php allows setting arbitrary HTTP headers (including the Cookie header), and common.inc.php allows registering variables from the $_COOKIE value. This issue can, for example, be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2018-19835 to bypass many XSS filters such as the Chrome XSS filter.
