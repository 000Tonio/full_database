An issue was discovered in Xpdf 4.00. catalog->getNumPages() in AcroForm.cc allows attackers to launch a denial of service (hang caused by large loop) via a specific pdf file, as demonstrated by pdftohtml. This is mainly caused by a large number after the /Count field in the file.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
