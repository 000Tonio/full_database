VOBOT CLOCK before 0.99.30 devices do not verify X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information, and consequently execute arbitrary code, via a crafted certificate, as demonstrated by leveraging a hardcoded --no-check-certificate Wget option.
