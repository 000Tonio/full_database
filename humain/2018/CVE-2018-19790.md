# CVE-2018-19790

- Published: 2018-12-18T22:29:00

- Modified: 2019-05-10T16:29:00

An open redirect was discovered in Symfony 2.7.x before 2.7.50, 2.8.x before 2.8.49, 3.x before 3.4.20, 4.0.x before 4.0.15, 4.1.x before 4.1.9 and 4.2.x before 4.2.1. By using backslashes in the `_failure_path` input field of login forms, an attacker can work around the redirection target restrictions and effectively redirect the user to any domain after login.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
