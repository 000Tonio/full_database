An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.10.x allowing x86 HVM guest OS users to cause a denial of service (unexpectedly high interrupt number, array overrun, and hypervisor crash) or possibly gain hypervisor privileges by setting up an HPET timer to deliver interrupts in IO-APIC mode, aka vHPET interrupt injection.
