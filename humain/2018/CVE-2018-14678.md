# CVE-2018-14678

- Published: 2018-07-28T18:29:00

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 4.17.11, as used in Xen through 4.11.x. The xen_failsafe_callback entry point in arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S does not properly maintain RBX, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory usage and system crash). Within Xen, 64-bit x86 PV Linux guest OS users can trigger a guest OS crash or possibly gain privileges.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
