In FreeBSD before 11.1-STABLE, 11.1-RELEASE-p7, 10.4-STABLE, 10.4-RELEASE-p7, and 10.3-RELEASE-p28, the kernel does not properly validate IPsec packets coming from a trusted host. Additionally, a use-after-free vulnerability exists in the IPsec AH handling code. This issue could cause a system crash or other unpredictable results.
