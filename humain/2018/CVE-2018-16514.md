A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the View Filters page (view_filters_page.php) and Edit Filter page (manage_filter_edit_page.php) in MantisBT 2.1.0 through 2.17.0 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary code (if CSP settings permit it) through a crafted PATH_INFO. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2018-13055.
