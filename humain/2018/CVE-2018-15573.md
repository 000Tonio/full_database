** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in Reprise License Manager (RLM) through 12.2BL2. Attackers can use the web interface to read and write data to any file on disk (as long as rlm.exe has access to it) via /goform/edit_lf_process with file content in the lfdata parameter and a pathname in the lf parameter. By default, the web interface is on port 5054, and does not require authentication. NOTE: the vendor has stated "We do not consider this a vulnerability."
