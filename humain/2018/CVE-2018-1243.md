# CVE-2018-1243

- Published: 2018-07-02T17:29:00

Dell EMC iDRAC6, versions prior to 2.91, iDRAC7/iDRAC8, versions prior to 2.60.60.60 and iDRAC9, versions prior to 3.21.21.21, contain a weak CGI session ID vulnerability. The sessions invoked via CGI binaries use 96-bit numeric-only session ID values, which makes it easier for remote attackers to perform bruteforce session guessing attacks.

### CVSS Score: **5**
