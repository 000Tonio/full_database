# CVE-2018-14641

- Published: 2018-09-18T13:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-09T23:35:00

A security flaw was found in the ip_frag_reasm() function in net/ipv4/ip_fragment.c in the Linux kernel from 4.19-rc1 to 4.19-rc3 inclusive, which can cause a later system crash in ip_do_fragment(). With certain non-default, but non-rare, configuration of a victim host, an attacker can trigger this crash remotely, thus leading to a remote denial-of-service.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**
