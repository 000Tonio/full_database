LibreSSL before 2.6.5 and 2.7.x before 2.7.4 allows a memory-cache side-channel attack on DSA and ECDSA signatures, aka the Return Of the Hidden Number Problem or ROHNP. To discover a key, the attacker needs access to either the local machine or a different virtual machine on the same physical host.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
