- Published: 2018-11-08T20:29:00

keepalived before 2.0.7 has a heap-based buffer overflow when parsing HTTP status codes resulting in DoS or possibly unspecified other impact, because extract_status_code in lib/html.c has no validation of the status code and instead writes an unlimited amount of data to the heap.
