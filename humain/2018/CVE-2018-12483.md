OCS Inventory 2.4.1 is prone to a remote command-execution vulnerability. Specifically, this issue occurs because the content of the ipdiscover_analyser rzo GET parameter is concatenated to a string used in an exec() call in the PHP code. Authentication is needed in order to exploit this vulnerability.

### CVSS Score: **9**
