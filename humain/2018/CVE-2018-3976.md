An exploitable out-of-bounds write exists in the CALS Raster file format-parsing functionality of Canvas Draw version 5.0.0.28. A specially crafted CAL image processed via the application can lead to an out-of-bounds write, overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker can deliver a CAL image to trigger this vulnerability and gain code execution.
