The bt/bt_core system service in Tizen allows an unprivileged process to create a system user interface and control the Bluetooth pairing process, due to improper D-Bus security policy configurations. This affects Tizen before 5.0 M1, and Tizen-based firmwares including Samsung Galaxy Gear series before build RE2.
