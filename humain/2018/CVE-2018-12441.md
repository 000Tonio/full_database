# CVE-2018-12441

- Published: 2018-10-11T21:29:00

- Modified: 2020-08-24T17:37:00

The CorsairService Service in Corsair Utility Engine is installed with insecure default permissions, which allows unprivileged local users to execute arbitrary commands via modification of the CorsairService BINARY_PATH_NAME, leading to complete control of the affected system. The issue exists due to the Windows "Everyone" group being granted SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS permissions to the CorsairService Service.
