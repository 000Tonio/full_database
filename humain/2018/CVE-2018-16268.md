The SoundServer/FocusServer system services in Tizen allow an unprivileged process to perform media-related system actions, due to improper D-Bus security policy configurations. Such actions include playing an arbitrary sound file or DTMF tones. This affects Tizen before 5.0 M1, and Tizen-based firmwares including Samsung Galaxy Gear series before build RE2.
