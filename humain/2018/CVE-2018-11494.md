The "program extension upload" feature in OpenCart through 3.0.2.0 has a six-step process (upload, install, unzip, move, xml, remove) that allows attackers to execute arbitrary code if the remove step is skipped, because the attacker can discover a secret temporary directory name (containing 10 random digits) via a directory traversal attack involving language_info['code'].
