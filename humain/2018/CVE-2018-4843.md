Responding to a PROFINET DCP request with a specially crafted
PROFINET DCP packet could cause a Denial-of-Service condition of the requesting
system.

The security vulnerability could be exploited by an attacker located on
the same Ethernet segment (OSI Layer 2) as the targeted device. Successful
exploitation requires no user interaction or privileges and impacts the
availability of core functionality of the affected device. A manual restart
is required to recover the system.

At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security
vulnerability is known. Siemens provides mitigations to resolve the
security issue.  PROFIBUS interfaces are not affected.
