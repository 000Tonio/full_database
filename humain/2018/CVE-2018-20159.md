i-doit open 1.11.2 allows Remote Code Execution because ZIP archives are mishandled. It has an upload feature that allows an authenticated user with the administrator role to upload arbitrary files to the main website directory. Exploitation involves uploading a ".php" file within a ".zip" file because a ZIP archive is accepted by /admin/?req=modules&action=add as a plugin, and extracted to the main directory. In order for the ".zip" file to be accepted, it must also contain a package.json file.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
