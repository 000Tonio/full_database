** DISPUTED ** A remote attacker can bypass the System Manager Mode on the Canon LBP6030w web interface without a PIN for /checkLogin.cgi via vectors involving /portal_top.html to get full access to the device. NOTE: the vendor reportedly responded that this issue occurs when a customer keeps the default settings without using the countermeasures and best practices shown in the documentation.
