LG SuperSign CMS allows authentication bypass because the CAPTCHA requirement is skipped if a captcha:pass cookie is sent, and because the PIN is limited to four digits.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
