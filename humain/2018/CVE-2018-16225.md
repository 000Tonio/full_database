The QBee MultiSensor Camera through 4.16.4 accepts unencrypted network traffic from clients (such as the QBee Cam application through 1.0.5 for Android and the Swisscom Home application up to 10.7.2 for Android), which results in an attacker being able to reuse cookies to bypass authentication and disable the camera.

### CVSS Score: **6.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
