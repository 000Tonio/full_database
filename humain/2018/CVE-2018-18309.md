An issue was discovered in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.31. An invalid memory address dereference was discovered in read_reloc in reloc.c. The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and application crash, which leads to denial of service, as demonstrated by objdump, because of missing _bfd_clear_contents bounds checking.
