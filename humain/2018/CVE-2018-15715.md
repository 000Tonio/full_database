Zoom clients on Windows (before version 4.1.34814.1119), Mac OS (before version 4.1.34801.1116), and Linux (2.4.129780.0915 and below) are vulnerable to unauthorized message processing. A remote unauthenticated attacker can spoof UDP messages from a meeting attendee or Zoom server in order to invoke functionality in the target client. This allows the attacker to remove attendees from meetings, spoof messages from users, or hijack shared screens.
