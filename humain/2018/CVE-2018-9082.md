For some Iomega, Lenovo, LenovoEMC NAS devices versions 4.1.402.34662 and earlier, the password changing functionality available to authenticated users does not require the user's current password to set a new one. As a result, attackers with access to the user's session tokens can change their password and retain access to the user's account

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
