An issue was discovered on AudioCodes 450HD IP Phone devices with firmware 3.0.0.535.106. The traceroute and ping functionality, which uses a parameter in a request to command.cgi from the Monitoring page in the web UI, unsafely puts user-alterable data directly into an OS command, leading to Remote Code Execution via shell metacharacters in the query string.
