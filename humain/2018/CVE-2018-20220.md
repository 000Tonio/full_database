An issue was discovered on Teracue ENC-400 devices with firmware 2.56 and below. While the web interface requires authentication before it can be interacted with, a large portion of the HTTP endpoints are missing authentication. An attacker is able to view these pages before being authenticated, and some of these pages may disclose sensitive information.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
