# CVE-2018-16884

- Published: 2018-12-18T22:29:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:52:00

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's NFS41+ subsystem. NFS41+ shares mounted in different network namespaces at the same time can make bc_svc_process() use wrong back-channel IDs and cause a use-after-free vulnerability. Thus a malicious container user can cause a host kernel memory corruption and a system panic. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out.

### CVSS Score: **6.7**
