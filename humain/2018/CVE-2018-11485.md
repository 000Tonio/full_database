The MULTIDOTS WooCommerce Quick Reports plugin 1.0.6 and earlier for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored XSS. It allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code on the WooCommerce -> Orders admin page. The attack is possible by modifying the "referral_site" cookie to have an XSS payload, and placing an order.
