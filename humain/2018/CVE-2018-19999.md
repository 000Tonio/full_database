The local management interface in SolarWinds Serv-U FTP Server 15.1.6.25 has incorrect access controls that permit local users to bypass authentication in the application and execute code in the context of the Windows SYSTEM account, leading to privilege escalation. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have local access the the host running Serv-U, and a Serv-U administrator have an active management console session.
