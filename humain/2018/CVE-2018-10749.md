An issue was discovered on D-Link DSL-3782 EU 1.01 devices. An authenticated user can pass a long buffer as a 'commit' parameter to the '/userfs/bin/tcapi' binary (in the Diagnostics component) using the 'commit <node_name>' function and cause memory corruption. Furthermore, it is possible to redirect the flow of the program and execute arbitrary code.

### CVSS Score: **9**
