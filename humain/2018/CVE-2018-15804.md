An issue was discovered in the MapR File System in MapR Converged Data Platform and MapR-XD 6.x and earlier. Under certain conditions, it is possible for MapR ticket credentials to become compromised, allowing a user to escalate their privileges to act as (aka impersonate) any other user, including cluster administrators, aka bug# 31935.
