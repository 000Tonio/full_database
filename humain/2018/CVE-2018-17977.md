The Linux kernel 4.14.67 mishandles certain interaction among XFRM Netlink messages, IPPROTO_AH packets, and IPPROTO_IP packets, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and system hang) by leveraging root access to execute crafted applications, as demonstrated on CentOS 7.
