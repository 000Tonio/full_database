SaferVPN 4.2.5 for Windows suffers from a SYSTEM privilege escalation vulnerability in its "SaferVPN.Service" service. The "SaferVPN.Service" service executes "openvpn.exe" using OpenVPN config files located within the current user's %LOCALAPPDATA%\SaferVPN\OvpnConfig directory. An authenticated attacker may modify these configuration files to specify a dynamic library plugin that should run for every new VPN connection attempt. This plugin will execute code in the context of the SYSTEM user.
