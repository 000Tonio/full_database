In FreeBSD before 11.1-STABLE(r332303), 11.1-RELEASE-p10, 10.4-STABLE(r332321), and 10.4-RELEASE-p9, due to insufficient initialization of memory copied to userland in the Linux subsystem and Atheros wireless driver, small amounts of kernel memory may be disclosed to userland processes. Unprivileged authenticated local users may be able to access small amounts of privileged kernel data.
