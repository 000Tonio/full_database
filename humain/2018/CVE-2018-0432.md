A vulnerability in the error reporting feature of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain elevated privileges on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to a failure to properly validate certain parameters included within the error reporting application configuration. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted command to the error reporting feature. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain root-level privileges and take full control of the device.
