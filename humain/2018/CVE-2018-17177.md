An issue was discovered on Neato Botvac Connected 2.2.0 and Botvac 85 1.2.1 devices. Static encryption is used for the copying of so-called "black box" logs (event logs and core dumps) to a USB stick. These logs are RC4-encrypted with a 9-character password of *^JEd4W!I that is obfuscated by hiding it within a custom /bin/rc4_crypt binary.
