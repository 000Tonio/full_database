All ADB broadband gateways / routers based on the Epicentro platform are affected by an authorization bypass vulnerability where attackers are able to access and manipulate settings within the web interface that are forbidden to end users (e.g., by the ISP). An attacker would be able to enable the TELNET server or other settings as well.
