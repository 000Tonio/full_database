# CVE-2018-18607

- Published: 2018-10-23T17:29:00

An issue was discovered in elf_link_input_bfd in elflink.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.31. There is a NULL pointer dereference in elf_link_input_bfd when used for finding STT_TLS symbols without any TLS section. A specially crafted ELF allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service, as demonstrated by ld.
