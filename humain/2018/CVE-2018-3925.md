An exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the remote video-host communication of video-core's HTTP server of Samsung SmartThings Hub STH-ETH-250 devices with firmware version 0.20.17. The video-core process insecurely parses the AWSELB cookie while communicating with remote video-host servers, leading to a buffer overflow on the heap. An attacker able to impersonate the remote HTTP servers could trigger this vulnerability.
