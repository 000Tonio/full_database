Elasticsearch Alerting and Monitoring in versions before 6.4.1 or 5.6.12 have an information disclosure issue when secrets are configured via the API. The Elasticsearch _cluster/settings API, when queried, could leak sensitive configuration information such as passwords, tokens, or usernames. This could allow an authenticated Elasticsearch user to improperly view these details.

### CVSS Score: **4**
