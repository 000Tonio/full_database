- Published: 2018-09-21T07:29:00

- Modified: 2019-04-18T16:09:00

The matchCurrentInput function inside lou_translateString.c of Liblouis prior to 3.7 does not check the input string's length, allowing attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash via out-of-bounds read) by crafting an input file with certain translation dictionaries.
