Dell Networking OS10 versions prior to 10.4.3.0 contain a vulnerability in the Phone Home feature which does not properly validate the server's certificate authority during TLS handshake. Use of an invalid or malicious certificate could potentially allow an attacker to spoof a trusted entity by using a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
