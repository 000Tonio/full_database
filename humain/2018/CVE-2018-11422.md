Moxa OnCell G3100-HSPA Series version 1.6 Build 17100315 and prior use a proprietary configuration protocol that does not provide confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity security controls. All information is sent in plain text, and can be intercepted and modified. Any commands (including device reboot, configuration download or upload, or firmware upgrade) are accepted and executed by the device without authentication.
