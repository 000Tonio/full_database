- Published: 2018-03-08T14:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-03T00:03:00

Memory leak in the sas_smp_get_phy_events function in drivers/scsi/libsas/sas_expander.c in the Linux kernel through 4.15.7 allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via many read accesses to files in the /sys/class/sas_phy directory, as demonstrated by the /sys/class/sas_phy/phy-1:0:12/invalid_dword_count file.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
