The Squid Software Foundation Squid HTTP Caching Proxy version prior to version 4.0.23 contains a NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in HTTP Response X-Forwarded-For header processing that can result in Denial of Service to all clients of the proxy. This attack appear to be exploitable via Remote HTTP server responding with an X-Forwarded-For header to certain types of HTTP request. This vulnerability appears to have been fixed in 4.0.23 and later.
