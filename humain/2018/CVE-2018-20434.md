LibreNMS 1.46 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands by using the $_POST['community'] parameter to html/pages/addhost.inc.php during creation of a new device, and then making a /ajax_output.php?id=capture&format=text&type=snmpwalk&hostname=localhost request that triggers html/includes/output/capture.inc.php command mishandling.

### CVSS Score: **10**
