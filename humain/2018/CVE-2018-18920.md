# CVE-2018-18920

- Published: 2018-11-12T02:29:00

Py-EVM v0.2.0-alpha.33 allows attackers to make a vm.execute_bytecode call that triggers computation._stack.values with '"stack": [100, 100, 0]' where b'\x' was expected, resulting in an execution failure because of an invalid opcode. This is reportedly related to "smart contracts can be executed indefinitely without gas being paid."

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
