Integrated Data Protection Appliance versions 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 contain undocumented accounts named 'support' and 'admin' that are protected with default passwords. These accounts have limited privileges and can access certain system files only. A malicious user with the knowledge of the default passwords may potentially log in to the system and gain read and write access to certain system files.
