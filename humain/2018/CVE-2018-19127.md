A code injection vulnerability in /type.php in PHPCMS 2008 allows attackers to write arbitrary content to a website cache file with a controllable filename, leading to arbitrary code execution. The PHP code is sent via the template parameter, and is written to a data/cache_template/*.tpl.php file along with a "<?php function " substring.
