# CVE-2018-5710

- Published: 2018-01-16T09:29:00

- Modified: 2018-08-13T21:48:00

An issue was discovered in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) through 1.16. The pre-defined function "strlen" is getting a "NULL" string as a parameter value in plugins/kdb/ldap/libkdb_ldap/ldap_principal2.c in the Key Distribution Center (KDC), which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) via a modified kadmin client.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
