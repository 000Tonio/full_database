Cobham Satcom Sailor 250 and 500 devices before 1.25 contained an unauthenticated password reset vulnerability. This could allow modification of any user account's password (including the default "admin" account), without prior knowledge of their password. All that is required is knowledge of the username and attack vector (/index.lua?pageID=Administration usernameAdmChange, passwordAdmChange1, and passwordAdmChange2 fields).

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
