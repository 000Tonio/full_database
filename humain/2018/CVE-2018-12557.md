# CVE-2018-12557

- Published: 2018-06-19T05:29:00

- Modified: 2018-08-23T15:22:00

An issue was discovered in Zuul 3.x before 3.1.0. If nodes become offline during the build, the no_log attribute of a task is ignored. If the unreachable error occurred in a task used with a loop variable (e.g., with_items), the contents of the loop items would be printed in the console. This could lead to accidentally leaking credentials or secrets.

### CVSS Score: **5**
