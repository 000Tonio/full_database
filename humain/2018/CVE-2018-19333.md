pkg/sentry/kernel/shm/shm.go in Google gVisor before 2018-11-01 allows attackers to overwrite memory locations in processes running as root (but not escape the sandbox) via vectors involving IPC_RMID shmctl calls, because reference counting is mishandled.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
