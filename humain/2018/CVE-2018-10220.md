** DISPUTED ** Glastopf 3.1.3-dev has SSRF, as demonstrated by the abc.php a parameter. NOTE: the vendor indicates that this is intentional behavior because the product is a web application honeypot, and modules/handlers/emulators/rfi.py supports Remote File Inclusion emulation.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
