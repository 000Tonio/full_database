An issue was discovered in the MULTIDOTS Add Social Share Messenger Buttons Whatsapp and Viber plugin 1.0.8 for WordPress. If an admin user can be tricked into visiting a crafted URL created by an attacker (via spear phishing/social engineering), the attacker can change the plugin settings via wp-admin/admin-post.php CSRF. There's no nonce or capability check in the whatsapp_share_setting_add_update() function.
