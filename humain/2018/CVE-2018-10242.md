# CVE-2018-10242

- Published: 2019-04-04T15:29:00

- Modified: 2019-05-06T17:00:00

Suricata version 4.0.4 incorrectly handles the parsing of the SSH banner. A malformed SSH banner can cause the parsing code to read beyond the allocated data because SSHParseBanner in app-layer-ssh.c lacks a length check.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
