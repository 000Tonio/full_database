The GPCIDrv and GDrv low-level drivers in GIGABYTE APP Center v1.05.21 and earlier, AORUS GRAPHICS ENGINE before 1.57, XTREME GAMING ENGINE before 1.26, and OC GURU II v2.08 expose functionality to read/write data from/to IO ports. This could be leveraged in a number of ways to ultimately run code with elevated privileges.
