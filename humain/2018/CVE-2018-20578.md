An issue was discovered in NuttX before 7.27. The function netlib_parsehttpurl() in apps/netutils/netlib/netlib_parsehttpurl.c mishandles URLs longer than hostlen bytes (in the webclient, this is set by default to 40), leading to an Infinite Loop. The attack vector is the Location header of an HTTP 3xx response.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
