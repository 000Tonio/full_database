The installer for the Alcatel OSPREY3_MINI Modem component on EE EE40VB 4G mobile broadband modems with firmware before EE40_00_02.00_45 sets weak permissions (Everyone:Full Control) for the "Web Connecton\EE40" and "Web Connecton\EE40\BackgroundService" directories, which allows local users to gain privileges, as demonstrated by inserting a Trojan horse ServiceManager.exe file into the "Web Connecton\EE40\BackgroundService" directory.
