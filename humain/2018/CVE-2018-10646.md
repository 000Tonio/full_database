CyberGhost 6.5.0.3180 for Windows suffers from a SYSTEM privilege escalation vulnerability through the "CG6Service" service. This service establishes a NetNamedPipe endpoint that allows arbitrary installed applications to connect and call publicly exposed methods. The "ConnectToVpnServer" method accepts a "connectionParams" argument that provides attacker control of the OpenVPN command line. An attacker can specify a dynamic library plugin that should run for every new VPN connection attempt. This plugin will execute code in the context of the SYSTEM user.
