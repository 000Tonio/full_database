# CVE-2018-5721

- Published: 2018-01-17T06:29:00

Stack-based buffer overflow in the ej_update_variables function in router/httpd/web.c on ASUS routers (when using software from https://github.com/RMerl/asuswrt-merlin) allows web authenticated attackers to execute code via a request that updates a setting. In ej_update_variables, the length of the variable action_script is not checked, as long as it includes a "_wan_if" substring.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
