# CVE-2018-7259

- Published: 2018-02-20T00:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-03T00:03:00

The FSX / P3Dv4 installer 2.0.1.231 for Flight Sim Labs A320-X sends a user's Google account credentials to http://installLog.flightsimlabs.com/LogHandler3.ashx if a pirated serial number has been entered, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information, e.g., by sniffing the network for cleartext HTTP traffic. This behavior was removed in 2.0.1.232.

### CVSS Score: **5**
