The web console and JavaScript debugger do not sanitize all output that can be hyperlinked. Both will display "chrome:" links as active, clickable hyperlinks in their output. Web sites should not be able to directly link to internal chrome pages. Additionally, the JavaScript debugger will display "javascript:" links, which users could be tricked into clicking by malicious sites. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 60.
