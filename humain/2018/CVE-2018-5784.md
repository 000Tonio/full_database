# CVE-2018-5784

- Published: 2018-01-19T08:29:00

- Modified: 2019-04-22T16:19:00

In LibTIFF 4.0.9, there is an uncontrolled resource consumption in the TIFFSetDirectory function of tif_dir.c. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted tif file. This occurs because the declared number of directory entries is not validated against the actual number of directory entries.
