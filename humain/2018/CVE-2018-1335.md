# CVE-2018-1335

- Published: 2018-04-25T21:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-03T00:03:00

From Apache Tika versions 1.7 to 1.17, clients could send carefully crafted headers to tika-server that could be used to inject commands into the command line of the server running tika-server. This vulnerability only affects those running tika-server on a server that is open to untrusted clients. The mitigation is to upgrade to Tika 1.18.
