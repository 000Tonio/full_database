The server in LiteSpeed OpenLiteSpeed before 1.5.0 RC6 allows local users to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact by creating a symlink through which the openlitespeed program can be invoked with a long command name (involving ../ characters), which is mishandled in the LshttpdMain::getServerRootFromExecutablePath function.
