# CVE-2018-1000156

- Published: 2018-04-06T13:29:00

GNU Patch version 2.7.6 contains an input validation vulnerability when processing patch files, specifically the EDITOR_PROGRAM invocation (using ed) can result in code execution. This attack appear to be exploitable via a patch file processed via the patch utility. This is similar to FreeBSD's CVE-2015-1418 however although they share a common ancestry the code bases have diverged over time.
