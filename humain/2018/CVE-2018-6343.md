# CVE-2018-6343

- Published: 2018-12-31T22:29:00

Proxygen fails to validate that a secondary auth manager is set before dereferencing it. That can cause a denial of service issue when parsing a Certificate/CertificateRequest HTTP2 Frame over a fizz (TLS 1.3) transport. This issue affects Proxygen releases starting from v2018.10.29.00 until the fix in v2018.11.19.00.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
