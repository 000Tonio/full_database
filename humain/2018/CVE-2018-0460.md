A vulnerability in the REST API of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to read any file on an affected system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization and parameter validation checks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious API request with the authentication credentials of a low-privileged user. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read any file on the affected system.
