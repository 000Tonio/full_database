RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite versions prior to 4.0.11 (in 4.0.x series) and versions prior to 4.1.6.2 (in 4.1.x series) contain a key management error issue. A malicious TLS server could potentially cause a Denial Of Service (DoS) on TLS clients during the handshake when a very large prime value is sent to the TLS client, and an Ephemeral or Anonymous Diffie-Hellman cipher suite (DHE or ADH) is used.
