Reservo Image Hosting 1.6 is vulnerable to XSS attacks. The affected function is its search engine (the t parameter to the /search URI). Since there is an user/admin login interface, it's possible for attackers to steal sessions of users and thus admin(s). By sending users an infected URL, code will be executed.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
