A vulnerability in the web proxy functionality of Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco Web Security Appliances could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to exhaust system memory and cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected system. The vulnerability exists because the affected software improperly manages memory resources for TCP connections to a targeted device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a high number of TCP connections to the data interface of an affected device via IPv4 or IPv6. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to exhaust system memory, which could cause the system to stop processing new connections and result in a DoS condition. System recovery may require manual intervention. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvf36610.
