# CVE-2018-17974

An issue was discovered in Tcpreplay 4.3.0 beta1. A heap-based buffer over-read was triggered in the function dlt_en10mb_encode() of the file plugins/dlt_en10mb/en10mb.c, due to inappropriate values in the function memmove(). The length (pktlen + ctx -> l2len) can be larger than source value (packet + ctx->l2len) because the function fails to ensure the length of a packet is valid. This leads to Denial of Service.
