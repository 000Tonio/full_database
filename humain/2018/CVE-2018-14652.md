The Gluster file system through versions 3.12 and 4.1.4 is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the 'features/index' translator via the code handling the 'GF_XATTR_CLRLK_CMD' xattr in the 'pl_getxattr' function. A remote authenticated attacker could exploit this on a mounted volume to cause a denial of service.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
