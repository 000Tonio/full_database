The Motorola MBP853 firmware does not correctly validate server certificates. This allows for a Man in The Middle (MiTM) attack to take place between a Motorola MBP853 camera and the servers it communicates with. In one such instance, it was identified that the device was downloading what appeared to be a client certificate.
