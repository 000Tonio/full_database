Kaizen Asset Manager (Enterprise Edition) and Training Manager (Enterprise Edition) allow a remote attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution via file impersonation. For example, a malicious dynamic-link library (dll) assumed the identity of a temporary (tmp) file (isxdl.dll) and an executable file assumed the identity of a temporary file (996E.temp).
