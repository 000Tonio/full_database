In getOffsetForHorizontal of Layout.java, there is a possible application hang due to a slow width calculation. This could lead to remote denial of service if a contact with many hidden unicode characters were sent to the device and used by a local app, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation. Product: Android Versions: Android-7.0 Android-7.1.1 Android-7.1.2 Android-8.0 Android-8.1 Android-9.0 Android ID: A-78464361
