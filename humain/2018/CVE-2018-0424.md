A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of the Cisco RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall, Cisco RV130W Wireless-N Multifunction VPN Router, and Cisco RV215W Wireless-N VPN Router could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input to scripts by the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the root user.
