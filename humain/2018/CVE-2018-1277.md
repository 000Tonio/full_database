# CVE-2018-1277

- Published: 2018-04-30T20:29:00

- Modified: 2018-06-13T17:11:00

Cloud Foundry Garden-runC, versions prior to 1.13.0, does not correctly enforce disc quotas for Docker image layers. A remote authenticated user may push an app with a malicious Docker image that will consume more space on a Diego cell than allocated in their quota, potentially causing a DoS against the cell.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
