# CVE-2018-14622

- Published: 2018-08-30T13:29:00

- Modified: 2023-02-03T14:23:00

A null-pointer dereference vulnerability was found in libtirpc before version 0.3.3-rc3. The return value of makefd_xprt() was not checked in all instances, which could lead to a crash when the server exhausted the maximum number of available file descriptors. A remote attacker could cause an rpc-based application to crash by flooding it with new connections.
