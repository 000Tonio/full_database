IMFCameraProtect.sys in IObit Malware Fighter 6.2 (and possibly lower versions) is vulnerable to a stack-based buffer overflow. The attacker can use DeviceIoControl to pass a user specified size which can be used to overwrite return addresses. This can lead to a denial of service or code execution attack.
