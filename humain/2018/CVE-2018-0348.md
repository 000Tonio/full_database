A vulnerability in the CLI of the Cisco SD-WAN Solution could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the device and submitting malicious input to the load command within the VPN subsystem.
