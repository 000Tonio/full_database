# CVE-2018-10901

- Published: 2018-07-26T17:29:00

- Modified: 2020-07-15T03:15:00

A flaw was found in Linux kernel's KVM virtualization subsystem. The VMX code does not restore the GDT.LIMIT to the previous host value, but instead sets it to 64KB. With a corrupted GDT limit a host's userspace code has an ability to place malicious entries in the GDT, particularly to the per-cpu variables. An attacker can use this to escalate their privileges.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**
