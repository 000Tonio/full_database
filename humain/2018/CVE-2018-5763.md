An issue was discovered in OXID eShop Enterprise Edition before 5.3.7 and 6.x before 6.0.1. By entering specially crafted URLs, an attacker is able to bring the shop server to a standstill and hence, it stops working. This is only valid if OXID High Performance Option is activated and Varnish is used.
