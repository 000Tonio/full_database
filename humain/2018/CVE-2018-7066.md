# CVE-2018-7066

- Published: 2018-12-07T21:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-03T00:03:00

An unauthenticated remote command execution exists in Aruba ClearPass Policy Manager on linked devices. The ClearPass OnConnect feature permits administrators to link other network devices into ClearPass for the purpose of collecting enhanced information about connected endpoints. A defect in the API could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on one of the linked devices. This vulnerability is only applicable if credentials for devices have been supplied to ClearPass under Configuration -> Network -> Devices -> CLI Settings. Resolution: Fixed in 6.7.5 and 6.6.10-hotfix.
