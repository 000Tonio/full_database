Discuz! DiscuzX 3.4, when WeChat login is enabled, allows remote attackers to bypass authentication by leveraging a non-empty #wechat#common_member_wechatmp to gain login access to an account via a plugin.php ac=wxregister request (the attacker does not have control over which account will be accessed).

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
