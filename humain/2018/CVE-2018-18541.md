In Teeworlds before 0.6.5, connection packets could be forged. There was no challenge-response involved in the connection build up. A remote attacker could send connection packets from a spoofed IP address and occupy all server slots, or even use them for a reflection attack using map download packets.

### CVSS Score: **5**
