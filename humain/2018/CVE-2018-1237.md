Dell EMC ScaleIO versions prior to 2.5, contain improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts on the Light installation Agent (LIA). This component is deployed on every server in the ScaleIO cluster and is used for central management of ScaleIO nodes. A remote malicious user, having network access to LIA, could potentially exploit this vulnerability to launch brute force guessing of user names and passwords of user accounts on the LIA.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
