# CVE-2018-16055

- Published: 2018-09-26T22:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-03T00:03:00

An authenticated command injection vulnerability exists in status_interfaces.php via dhcp_relinquish_lease() in pfSense before 2.4.4 due to its passing user input from the $_POST parameters "ifdescr" and "ipv" to a shell without escaping the contents of the variables. This allows an authenticated WebGUI user with privileges for the affected page to execute commands in the context of the root user when submitting a request to relinquish a DHCP lease for an interface which is configured to obtain its address via DHCP.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
