An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.11.x allowing 64-bit PV guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) because #GP[0] can occur after a non-canonical address is passed to the TLB flushing code. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incorrect CVE-2017-5754 (aka Meltdown) mitigation.
