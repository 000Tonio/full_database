An issue was discovered in mass-pages-posts-creator.php in the MULTIDOTS Mass Pages/Posts Creator plugin 1.2.2 for WordPress. Any logged in user can launch Mass Pages/Posts creation with custom content. There is no nonce or user capability check, so anyone can launch a DoS attack against a site and create hundreds of thousands of posts with custom content.
