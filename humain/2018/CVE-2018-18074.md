- Published: 2018-10-09T17:29:00

- Modified: 2022-07-25T18:15:00

The Requests package before 2.20.0 for Python sends an HTTP Authorization header to an http URI upon receiving a same-hostname https-to-http redirect, which makes it easier for remote attackers to discover credentials by sniffing the network.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| --- | --- | --- |
