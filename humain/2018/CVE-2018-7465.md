An XSS issue was discovered in VirtueMart before 3.2.14. All the textareas in the backend of the plugin can be closed by simply adding </textarea> to the value and saving the product/config. By editing back the product/config, the editor's browser will execute everything after the </textarea>, leading to a possible XSS.
