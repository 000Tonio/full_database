# CVE-2018-12885

- Published: 2018-08-07T15:29:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T14:40:00

The randMod() function of the smart contract implementation for MyCryptoChamp, an Ethereum game, generates a random value with publicly readable variables such as the current block information and a private variable, (which can be read with a getStorageAt call). Therefore, attackers can get powerful champs/items and get rewards.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
