drivers/leds/leds-aw2023.c in the led driver for custom Linux kernels on the Xiaomi Redmi 6pro daisy-o-oss phone has several integer overflows because of a left-shifting operation when the right-hand operand can be equal to or greater than the integer length. This can be exploited by a crafted application for denial of service.
