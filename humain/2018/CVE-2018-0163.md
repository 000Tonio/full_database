A vulnerability in the 802.1x multiple-authentication (multi-auth) feature of Cisco IOS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass the authentication phase on an 802.1x multi-auth port. The vulnerability is due to a logic change error introduced into the code. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by trying to access an 802.1x multi-auth port after a successful supplicant has authenticated. An exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the 802.1x access controls and obtain access to the network. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg69701.
