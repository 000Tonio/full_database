# CVE-2018-11142

- Published: 2018-05-31T18:29:00

The 'systemui/settings_network.php' and 'systemui/settings_patching.php' scripts in the Quest KACE System Management Appliance 8.0.318 are accessible only from localhost. This restriction can be bypassed by modifying the 'Host' and 'X_Forwarded_For' HTTP headers in a POST request. An anonymous user can abuse this vulnerability to execute critical functions without authorization.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
