A vulnerability in the DHCP service of Cisco Industrial Network Director could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of DHCP lease requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious DHCP lease requests to an affected application. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the DHCP service to terminate, resulting in a DoS condition.
