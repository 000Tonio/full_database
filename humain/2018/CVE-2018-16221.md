# CVE-2018-16221

- Published: 2019-05-29T18:29:00

- Modified: 2019-05-30T14:25:00

The diagnostics web interface in the Yeahlink Ultra-elegant IP Phone SIP-T41P (firmware 66.83.0.35) does not validate (escape) the path information (path traversal), which allows an authenticated remote attacker to get access to privileged information (e.g., /etc/passwd) via path traversal (relative path information in the file parameter of the corresponding POST request).

### CVSS Score: **7.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
