An issue was discovered on Shenzhen Skyworth DT741 Converged Intelligent Terminal (G/EPON+IPTV) SDOTBGN1, DT721-cb SDOTBGN1, and DT741-cb SDOTBGN1 devices. A long password to the Web_passwd function allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) or achieve unauthenticated remote code execution because of control of registers S0 through S4 and T4 through T7.
