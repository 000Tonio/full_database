# CVE-2018-19748

- Published: 2018-11-29T21:29:00

app/plug/attachment/controller/admincontroller.php in SDCMS 1.6 allows reading arbitrary files via a /?m=plug&c=admin&a=index&p=attachment&root= directory traversal. The value of the root parameter must be base64 encoded (note that base64 encoding, instead of URL encoding, is very rare in a directory traversal attack vector).

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
