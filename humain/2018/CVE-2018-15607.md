In ImageMagick 7.0.8-11 Q16, a tiny input file 0x50 0x36 0x36 0x36 0x36 0x4c 0x36 0x38 0x36 0x36 0x36 0x36 0x36 0x36 0x1f 0x35 0x50 0x00 can result in a hang of several minutes during which CPU and memory resources are consumed until ultimately an attempted large memory allocation fails. Remote attackers could leverage this vulnerability to cause a denial of service via a crafted file.
