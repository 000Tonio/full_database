- Published: 2018-08-30T13:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-09T23:35:00

An infinite loop vulnerability was found in libtirpc before version 1.0.2-rc2. With the port to using poll rather than select, exhaustion of file descriptors would cause the server to enter an infinite loop, consuming a large amount of CPU time and denying service to other clients until restarted.
