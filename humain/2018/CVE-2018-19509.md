# CVE-2018-19509

- Published: 2019-03-21T16:00:00

wg7.php in Webgalamb 7.0 makes opportunistic calls to htmlspecialchars() instead of using a templating engine with proper contextual encoding. Because it is possible to insert arbitrary strings into the database, any JavaScript could be executed by the administrator, leading to XSS.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
