In Puppet Discovery prior to 1.2.0, when running Discovery against Windows hosts, WinRM connections can fall back to using basic auth over insecure channels if a HTTPS server is not available. This can expose the login credentials being used by Puppet Discovery.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
