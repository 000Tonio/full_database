# CVE-2018-19858

- Published: 2019-01-30T15:29:00

PrinceXML, versions 10 and below, is vulnerable to XXE due to the lack of protection against external entities. If an attacker passes HTML referencing an XML file (e.g., in an IFRAME element), PrinceXML will fetch the XML and parse it, thus giving an attacker file-read access and full-fledged SSRF.
