The Symantec Messaging Gateway product prior to 10.6.6 may be susceptible to a XML external entity (XXE) exploit, which is a type of issue where XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. The attack uses file URI schemes or relative paths in the system identifier to access files that should not normally be accessible.
