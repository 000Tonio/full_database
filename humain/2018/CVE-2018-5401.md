The devices transmit process control information via unencrypted Modbus communications. Impact: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to observe information about configurations, settings, what sensors are present and in use, and other information to aid in crafting spoofed messages. Requires access to the network. Affected releases are Auto-Maskin DCU-210E, RP-210E, and Marine Pro Observer Android App. Versions prior to 3.7 on ARMv7.
