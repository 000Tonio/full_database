A vulnerability has been identified in TIM 1531 IRC (All versions < V1.1). A remote attacker with network access to port 80/tcp or port 443/tcp could perform administrative operations on the device without prior authentication. Successful exploitation could allow to cause a denial-of-service, or read and manipulate data as well as configuration settings of the affected device. At the stage of publishing this security advisory no public exploitation is known. Siemens provides mitigations to resolve it.
