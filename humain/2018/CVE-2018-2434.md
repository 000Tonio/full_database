- Published: 2018-07-10T18:29:00

A content spoofing vulnerability in the following components allows to render html pages containing arbitrary plain text content, which might fool an end user: UI add-on for SAP NetWeaver (UI_Infra, 1.0), SAP UI Implementation for Decoupled Innovations (UI_700, 2.0): SAP NetWeaver 7.00 Implementation, SAP User Interface Technology (SAP_UI 7.4, 7.5, 7.51, 7.52). There is little impact as it is not possible to embed active contents such as JavaScript or hyperlinks.
