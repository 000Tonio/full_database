An issue was discovered in regex.yaml (aka regexes.yaml) in UA-Parser UAP-Core before 0.6.0. A Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) issue allows remote attackers to overload a server by setting the User-Agent header in an HTTP(S) request to a value containing a long digit string. (The UAP-Core project contains the vulnerability, propagating to all implementations.)
