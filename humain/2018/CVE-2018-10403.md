An issue was discovered in F-Secure XFENCE and Little Flocker. A maliciously crafted Universal/fat binary can evade third-party code signing checks. By not completing full inspection of the Universal/fat binary, the user of the third-party tool will believe that the code is signed by Apple, but the malicious unsigned code will execute.
