SolarWinds Serv-U MFT before 15.1.6 HFv1 assigns authenticated users a low-entropy session token that can be included in requests to the application as a URL parameter in lieu of a session cookie. This session token's value can be brute-forced by an attacker to obtain the corresponding session cookie and hijack the user's session.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
