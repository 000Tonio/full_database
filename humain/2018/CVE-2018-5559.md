In Rapid7 Komand version 0.41.0 and prior, certain endpoints that are able to list the always encrypted-at-rest connection data could return some configurations of connection data without obscuring sensitive data from the API response sent over an encrypted channel. This issue does not affect Rapid7 Komand version 0.42.0 and later versions.
