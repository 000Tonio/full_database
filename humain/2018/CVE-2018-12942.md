SQL injection vulnerability in the "Users management" functionality in SeedDMS (formerly LetoDMS and MyDMS) before 5.1.8 allows authenticated attackers to manipulate an SQL query within the application by sending additional SQL commands to the application server. An attacker can use this vulnerability to perform malicious tasks such as to extract, change, or delete sensitive information within the database supporting the application, and potentially run system commands on the underlying operating system.
