The MP4Atom class in mp4atom.cpp in MP4v2 through 2.0.0 mishandles Entry Number validation for the MP4 Table Property, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (overflow, insufficient memory allocation, and segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted mp4 file.
