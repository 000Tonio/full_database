A Pektron Passive Keyless Entry and Start (PKES) system, as used on the Tesla Model S and possibly other vehicles, relies on the DST40 cipher, which makes it easier for attackers to obtain access via an approach involving a 5.4 TB precomputation, followed by wake-frame reception and two challenge/response operations, to clone a key fob within a few seconds.
