# CVE-2018-15664

In Docker through 18.06.1-ce-rc2, the API endpoints behind the 'docker cp' command are vulnerable to a symlink-exchange attack with Directory Traversal, giving attackers arbitrary read-write access to the host filesystem with root privileges, because daemon/archive.go does not do archive operations on a frozen filesystem (or from within a chroot).

### CVSS Score: **6.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
