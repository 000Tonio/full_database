# CVE-2018-1117

- Published: 2018-06-20T01:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-09T23:38:00

ovirt-ansible-roles before version 1.0.6 has a vulnerability due to a missing no_log directive, resulting in the 'Add oVirt Provider to ManageIQ/CloudForms' playbook inadvertently disclosing admin passwords in the provisioning log. In an environment where logs are shared with other parties, this could lead to privilege escalation.
