# CVE-2018-0043

- Published: 2018-10-10T18:29:00

Receipt of a specific MPLS packet may cause the routing protocol daemon (RPD) process to crash and restart or may lead to remote code execution. By continuously sending specific MPLS packets, an attacker can repeatedly crash the RPD process causing a sustained Denial of Service. This issue affects both IPv4 and IPv6. This issue can only be exploited from within the MPLS domain. End-users connected to the CE device cannot cause this crash. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.1X46 versions prior to 12.1X46-D77 on SRX Series; 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S10; 12.3X48 versions prior to 12.3X48-D75 on SRX Series; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D47 on QFX/EX Series; 14.1X53 versions prior to 14.1X53-D130 on QFabric Series; 15.1F6 versions prior to 15.1F6-S10; 15.1 versions prior to 15.1R4-S9 15.1R7; 15.1X49 versions prior to 15.1X49-D140 on SRX Series; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D59 on EX2300/EX3400 Series; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D67 on QFX10K Series; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D233 on QFX5200/QFX5110 Series; 15.1X53 versions prior to 15.1X53-D471 15.1X53-D490 on NFX Series; 16.1 versions prior to 16.1R3-S8 16.1R4-S8 16.1R5-S4 16.1R6-S4 16.1R7; 16.1X65 versions prior to 16.1X65-D48; 16.2 versions prior to 16.2R1-S6 16.2R3; 17.1 versions prior to 17.1R1-S7 17.1R2-S6 17.1R3; 17.2 versions prior to 17.2R1-S6 17.2R2-S3 17.2R3; 17.2X75 versions prior to 17.2X75-D100 17.2X75-D42 17.2X75-D91; 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R1-S4 17.3R2-S2 17.3R3; 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R1-S3 17.4R2 .
