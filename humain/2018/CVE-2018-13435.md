** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the LINE jp.naver.line application 8.8.0 for iOS. The Passcode feature allows authentication bypass via runtime manipulation that forces a certain method to disable passcode authentication.  NOTE: the vendor indicates that this is not an attack of interest within the context of their threat model, which excludes iOS devices on which a jailbreak has occurred.
