** DISPUTED ** main.aspx in Microstrategy Analytics 10.4.0026.0049 and earlier has CSRF. NOTE: The vendor claims that documentation for preventing a CSRF attack has been provided (https://community.microstrategy.com/s/article/KB37643-New-security-feature-introduced-in-MicroStrategy-Web-9-0?language=en_US) and disagrees that this issue is a vulnerability. They also claim that MicroStrategy was never properly informed of this issue via normal support channels or their vulnerability reporting page on their website, so they were unable to evaluate the report or explain how this is something their customers view as a feature and not a security vulnerability.
