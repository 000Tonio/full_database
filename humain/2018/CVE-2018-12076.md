A vulnerability in the UPC bar code of the Avanti Markets MarketCard could allow an unauthenticated, local attacker to access funds within the customer's MarketCard balance, and also could lead to Customer Information Disclosure. The vulnerability is due to lack of proper validation of the UPC bar code present on the MarketCard. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by generating a copy of a customer's bar code. An exploit could allow the attacker to access all funds located within the MarketCard or allow unauthenticated disclosure of information.
