Smarty_Security::isTrustedResourceDir() in Smarty before 3.1.33 is prone to a path traversal vulnerability due to insufficient template code sanitization. This allows attackers controlling the executed template code to bypass the trusted directory security restriction and read arbitrary files.

### CVSS Score: **5**
