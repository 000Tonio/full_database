# CVE-2018-20405

** DISPUTED ** BigTree 4.3 allows full path disclosure via authenticated admin/news/ input that triggers a syntax error. NOTE: This has been disputed with the following reasoning: "The issue reported requires full developer level access to the content management system where cross site scripting is not an issue -- you already have full control of the CMS including running arbitrary PHP."

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
