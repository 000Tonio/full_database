# CVE-2018-13013

Improper check of unusual conditions when launching msiexec.exe in safensec.com (SysWatch service) in SAFE'N'SEC SoftControl/SafenSoft SysWatch, SoftControl/SafenSoft TPSecure, and SoftControl/SafenSoft Enterprise Suite before 4.4.9 allows the local attacker to bypass a code-signing protection mechanism and install/execute an unauthorized program by modifying the system configuration and installing a forged MSI file. (The intended behavior is that the component SysWatch does not allow installation of MSI files unless they are signed by a limited list of certificates.)
