# CVE-2018-1118

- Published: 2018-05-10T22:29:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:53:00

Linux kernel vhost since version 4.8 does not properly initialize memory in messages passed between virtual guests and the host operating system in the vhost/vhost.c:vhost_new_msg() function. This can allow local privileged users to read some kernel memory contents when reading from the /dev/vhost-net device file.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
