An exploitable integer underflow vulnerability exists in the ZigBee firmware update routine of the hubCore binary of the Samsung SmartThings Hub STH-ETH-250 - Firmware version 0.20.17. The hubCore process incorrectly handles malformed files existing in its data directory, leading to an infinite loop, which eventually causes the process to crash. An attacker can send an HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability.
