A vulnerability in the MyWebex component of Cisco Webex Business Suite could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a user to click a crafted URL. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker may provide a link that directs a user to a malicious site and use misleading language or instructions to persuade the user to follow the provided link.
