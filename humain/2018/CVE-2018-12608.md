# CVE-2018-12608

- Published: 2018-09-10T17:29:00

- Modified: 2018-11-19T16:29:00

An issue was discovered in Docker Moby before 17.06.0. The Docker engine validated a client TLS certificate using both the configured client CA root certificate and all system roots on non-Windows systems. This allowed a client with any domain validated certificate signed by a system-trusted root CA (as opposed to one signed by the configured CA root certificate) to authenticate.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |

| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
