NetApp 7-Mode Transition Tool allows users with valid credentials to access functions and information which may have been intended to be restricted to administrators or privileged users. 7MTT versions below 2.0 do not enforce user authorization rules on file information and status that it has previously collected. The released version of 7MTT has been updated to maintain and verify authorization rules for file information, status and utilities.
