internal/advanced_comment_system/admin.php in Advanced Comment System 1.0 is prone to an SQL injection vulnerability because it fails to sufficiently sanitize user-supplied data before using it in an SQL query, allowing remote attackers to execute the sqli attack via a URL in the "page" parameter.  NOTE: The product is discontinued.
