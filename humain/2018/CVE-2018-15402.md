A vulnerability in Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. The vulnerability is due to improper validation of Origin headers on HTTP requests within the management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a targeted user to follow a URL to a malicious website. An exploit could allow the attacker to take actions within the software with the privileges of the targeted user or gain access to sensitive information.
