In Nessus before 7.1.0, a XSS vulnerability exists due to improper input validation. A remote authenticated attacker could create and upload a .nessus file, which may be viewed by an administrator allowing for the execution of arbitrary script code in a user's browser session. In other scenarios, XSS could also occur by altering variables from the Advanced Settings.
