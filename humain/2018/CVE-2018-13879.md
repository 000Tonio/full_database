A reflected XSS issue was discovered in the registration form in Rocket.Chat before 0.66. When one creates an account, the next step will ask for a username. This field will not save HTML control characters but an error will be displayed that shows the attempted username unescaped via packages/rocketchat-ui-login/client/username/username.js in packages/rocketchat-ui-login/client/username/username.html.
