In Octopus Deploy 3.4.x before 2018.4.7, an authenticated user is able to view/update/save variable values within the Tenant Variables area for Environments that do not exist within their associated Team scoping. This occurs in situations where this authenticated user also belongs to multiple teams, where one of the Teams has the VariableEdit permission or VariableView permissions for the Environment.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
