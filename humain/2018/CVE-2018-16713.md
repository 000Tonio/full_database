IObit Advanced SystemCare, which includes Monitor_win10_x64.sys or Monitor_win7_x64.sys, 1.2.0.5 (and possibly earlier versions) allows a user to send an IOCTL (0x9C402084) with a buffer containing user defined content. The driver's subroutine will execute a rdmsr instruction with the user's buffer for input, and provide output from the instruction.
