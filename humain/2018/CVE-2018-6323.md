# CVE-2018-6323

- Published: 2018-01-26T08:29:00

The elf_object_p function in elfcode.h in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29.1, has an unsigned integer overflow because bfd_size_type multiplication is not used. A crafted ELF file allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact.
