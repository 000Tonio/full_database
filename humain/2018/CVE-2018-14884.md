# CVE-2018-14884

- Published: 2018-08-03T13:29:00

An issue was discovered in PHP 7.0.x before 7.0.27, 7.1.x before 7.1.13, and 7.2.x before 7.2.1. Inappropriately parsing an HTTP response leads to a segmentation fault because http_header_value in ext/standard/http_fopen_wrapper.c can be a NULL value that is mishandled in an atoi call.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |

| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
