In all android releases (Android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, QRD Android) from CAF using the linux kernel, WLAN handler indication from the firmware gets the information for 4 access categories. While processing this information only the first 3 AC information is copied due to the improper conditional logic used to compare with the max number of categories.
