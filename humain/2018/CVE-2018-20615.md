# CVE-2018-20615

- Published: 2019-03-21T16:00:00

- Modified: 2019-04-25T12:57:00

An out-of-bounds read issue was discovered in the HTTP/2 protocol decoder in HAProxy 1.8.x and 1.9.x through 1.9.0 which can result in a crash. The processing of the PRIORITY flag in a HEADERS frame requires 5 extra bytes, and while these bytes are skipped, the total frame length was not re-checked to make sure they were present in the frame.

### CVSS Score: **5**
