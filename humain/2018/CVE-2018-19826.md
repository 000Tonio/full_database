** DISPUTED ** In inspect.cpp in LibSass 3.5.5, a high memory footprint caused by an endless loop (containing a Sass::Inspect::operator()(Sass::String_Quoted*) stack frame) may cause a Denial of Service via crafted sass input files with stray '&' or '/' characters. NOTE: Upstream comments indicate this issue is closed as "won't fix" and "works as intended" by design.
