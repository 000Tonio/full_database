# CVE-2018-17159

- Published: 2018-12-04T15:29:00

In FreeBSD before 11.2-STABLE(r340854) and 11.2-RELEASE-p5, the NFS server lacks a bounds check in the READDIRPLUS NFS request. Unprivileged remote users with access to the NFS server can cause a resource exhaustion by forcing the server to allocate an arbitrarily large memory allocation.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
