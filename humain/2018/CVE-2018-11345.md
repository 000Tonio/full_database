# CVE-2018-11345

An unrestricted file upload vulnerability in upload.cgi in ASUSTOR AS6202T ADM 3.1.0.RFQ3 allows attackers to upload supplied data via the POST parameter filename. This can be used to place attacker controlled code on the file system that can then be executed. Further, the filename parameter is vulnerable to path traversal and allows the attacker to place the file anywhere on the system.
