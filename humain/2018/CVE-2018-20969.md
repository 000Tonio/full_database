# CVE-2018-20969

- Published: 2019-08-16T04:15:00

- Modified: 2019-09-05T16:15:00

do_ed_script in pch.c in GNU patch through 2.7.6 does not block strings beginning with a ! character. NOTE: this is the same commit as for CVE-2019-13638, but the ! syntax is specific to ed, and is unrelated to a shell metacharacter.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**
