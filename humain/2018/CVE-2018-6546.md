plays_service.exe in the plays.tv service before 1.27.7.0, as distributed in AMD driver-installation packages and Gaming Evolved products, executes code at a user-defined (local or SMB) path as SYSTEM when the execute_installer parameter is used in an HTTP message. This occurs without properly authenticating the user.
