A vulnerability in the IPv6 subsystem of Cisco IOS XR Software Release 5.3.4 for the Cisco Aggregation Services Router (ASR) 9000 Series could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to trigger a reload of one or more Trident-based line cards, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of IPv6 packets with a fragment header extension. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending IPv6 packets designed to trigger the issue either to or through the Trident-based line card. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to trigger a reload of Trident-based line cards, resulting in a DoS during the period of time the line card takes to restart. This vulnerability affects Cisco Aggregation Services Router (ASR) 9000 Series when the following conditions are met: The router is running Cisco IOS XR Software Release 5.3.4, and the router has installed Trident-based line cards that have IPv6 configured. A software maintenance upgrade (SMU) has been made available that addresses this vulnerability. The fix has also been incorporated into service pack 7 for Cisco IOS XR Software Release 5.3.4. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvg46800.
