** DISPUTED ** Webgrind 1.5 relies on user input to display a file, which lets anyone view files from the local filesystem (that the webserver user has access to) via an index.php?op=fileviewer&file= URI. NOTE: the vendor indicates that the product is not intended for a "publicly accessible environment."
