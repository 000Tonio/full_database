An issue was discovered in WUZHI CMS V4.1.0. There is a persistent XSS vulnerability that can steal the administrator cookies via the tag[tag] parameter to the index.php?m=tags&f=index&v=add&&_su=wuzhicms URI. After a website editor (whose privilege is lower than the administrator) logs in, he can add a new TAGS with the XSS payload.
