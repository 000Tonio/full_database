The setup wizard (ie5setup.exe) for Internet Explorer 5.0 disables (1) the screen saver, which could leave the system open to users with physical access if a failure occurs during an unattended installation, and (2) the Task Scheduler Service, which might prevent the scheduled execution of security-critical programs.
