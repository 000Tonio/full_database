# CVE-1999-1075

- Published: 1998-03-18T05:00:00

- Modified: 2016-10-18T02:01:00

inetd in AIX 4.1.5 dynamically assigns a port N when starting ttdbserver (ToolTalk server), but also inadvertently listens on port N-1 without passing control to ttdbserver, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a large number of connections to port N-1, which are not properly closed by inetd.

### CVSS Score: **5**
