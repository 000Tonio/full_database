The access permissions for a UNIX domain socket are ignored in Solaris 2.x and SunOS 4.x, and other BSD-based operating systems before 4.4, which could allow local users to connect to the socket and possibly disrupt or control the operations of the program using that socket.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
