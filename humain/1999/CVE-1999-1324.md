VAXstations running Open VMS 5.3 through 5.5-2 with VMS DECwindows or MOTIF do not properly disable access to user accounts that exceed the break-in limit threshold for failed login attempts, which makes it easier for attackers to conduct brute force password guessing.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |
