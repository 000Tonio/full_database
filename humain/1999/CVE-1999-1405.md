# CVE-1999-1405

- Published: 1999-02-17T05:00:00

- Modified: 2016-10-18T02:04:00

snap command in AIX before 4.3.2 creates the /tmp/ibmsupt directory with world-readable permissions and does not remove or clear the directory when snap -a is executed, which could allow local users to access the shadowed password file by creating /tmp/ibmsupt/general/passwd before root runs snap -a. Fixed in AIX 4.3 and 4.3.2
AIX 4.3.x APAR: IX88263
AIX 4.2.x APAR: IX88261
