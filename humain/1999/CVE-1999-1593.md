Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (connectivity loss) or steal credentials via a 1Ch registration that causes WINS to change the domain controller to point to a malicious server.  NOTE: this problem may be limited when Windows 95/98 clients are used, or if the primary domain controller becomes unavailable.
