- Published: 1999-06-09T04:00:00

- Modified: 2017-12-19T02:29:00

ssh 2.0.12, and possibly other versions, allows valid user names to attempt to enter the correct password multiple times, but only prompts an invalid user name for a password once, which allows remote attackers to determine user account names on the server.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
