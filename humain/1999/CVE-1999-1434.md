# CVE-1999-1434

- Published: 1998-07-13T04:00:00

- Modified: 2016-10-18T02:04:00

login in Slackware Linux 3.2 through 3.5 does not properly check for an error when the /etc/group file is missing, which prevents it from dropping privileges, causing it to assign root privileges to any local user who logs on to the server.
