# CVE-2012-0217

- Published: 2012-06-12T22:55:00

- Modified: 2020-09-28T12:58:00

The x86-64 kernel system-call functionality in Xen 4.1.2 and earlier, as used in Citrix XenServer 6.0.2 and earlier and other products; Oracle Solaris 11 and earlier; illumos before r13724; Joyent SmartOS before 20120614T184600Z; FreeBSD before 9.0-RELEASE-p3; NetBSD 6.0 Beta and earlier; Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 and R2 SP1 and Windows 7 Gold and SP1; and possibly other operating systems, when running on an Intel processor, incorrectly uses the sysret path in cases where a certain address is not a canonical address, which allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted application.  NOTE: because this issue is due to incorrect use of the Intel specification, it should have been split into separate identifiers; however, there was some value in preserving the original mapping of the multi-codebase coordinated-disclosure effort to a single identifier. Per: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms12-042

'This vulnerability only affects Intel x64-based versions of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2.  Systems with AMD or ARM-based CPUs are not affected by this vulnerability.'
