# CVE-2012-3481

- Published: 2012-08-25T10:29:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:25:00

Integer overflow in the ReadImage function in plug-ins/common/file-gif-load.c in the GIF image format plug-in in GIMP 2.8.x and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted height and len properties in a GIF image file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow. NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.
