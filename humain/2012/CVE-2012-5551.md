Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the MailChimp module 7.x-2.x before 7.x-2.7 for Drupal allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors related to (1) a predictable "webhook URL key" and (2) improper sanitization of "Webhook variables from POST requests."

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
