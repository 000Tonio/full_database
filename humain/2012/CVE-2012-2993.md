- Published: 2012-09-18T03:48:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:31:00

Microsoft Windows Phone 7 does not verify the domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) field of an X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof an SSL server for the (1) POP3, (2) IMAP, or (3) SMTP protocol via an arbitrary valid certificate. Per http://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/389795 "A remote attacker with the ability to pose as a man-in-the-middle may be able to view the login or session data in the corresponding protocol (e.g., SMTP, POP3, etc.)."
