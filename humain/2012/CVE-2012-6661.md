# CVE-2012-6661

- Published: 2014-11-03T22:55:00

- Modified: 2014-11-05T03:32:00

Zope before 2.13.19, as used in Plone before 4.2.3 and 4.3 before beta 1, does not reseed the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG), which makes it easier for remote attackers to guess the value via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: this issue was SPLIT from CVE-2012-5508 due to different vulnerability types (ADT2).

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
