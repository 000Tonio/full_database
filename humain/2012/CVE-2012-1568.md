# CVE-2012-1568

- Published: 2013-03-01T05:40:00

The ExecShield feature in a certain Red Hat patch for the Linux kernel in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 and 6 and Fedora 15 and 16 does not properly handle use of many shared libraries by a 32-bit executable file, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism by leveraging a predictable base address for one of these libraries.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |
