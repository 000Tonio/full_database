# CVE-2012-5701

- Published: 2014-10-20T15:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:32:00

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in dotProject before 2.1.7 allow remote authenticated administrators to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) search_string or (2) where parameter in a contacts action, (3) dept_id parameter in a departments action, (4) project_id[] parameter in a project action, or (5) company_id parameter in a system action to index.php.  NOTE: this can be leveraged using CSRF to allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
