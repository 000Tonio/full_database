# CVE-2012-3372

** DISPUTED ** The default configuration of Cyberoam UTM appliances uses the same Certification Authority certificate and same private key across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers by leveraging the presence of the Cyberoam_SSL_CA certificate in a list of trusted root certification authorities.  NOTE: the vendor disputes the significance of this issue because the appliance "does not allow import or export of the foresaid private key."

### CVSS Score: **5.8**
