Windows Firewall in tcpip.sys in Microsoft Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2, R2, and R2 SP1, and Windows 7 Gold and SP1 does not properly enforce firewall rules for outbound broadcast packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information by observing broadcast traffic on a local network, aka "Windows Firewall Bypass Vulnerability." Per http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/bulletin/ms12-032 "An attacker must have valid logon credentials and be able to log on locally to exploit this vulnerability." "In order to use this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to gain access to the local subnet of the target computer. An attacker could then use another vulnerability to acquire information about the target system or execute code on the target system."
