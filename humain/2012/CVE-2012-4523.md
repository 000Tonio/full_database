- Published: 2012-11-20T00:55:00

- Modified: 2013-01-30T04:55:00

radsecproxy before 1.6.1 does not properly verify certificates when there are configuration blocks with CA settings that are unrelated to the block being used for verifying the certificate chain, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and spoof clients.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
