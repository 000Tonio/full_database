The SSLVPN implementation in Cisco IOS 12.4, 15.0, 15.1, and 15.2, when DTLS is not enabled, does not properly handle certain outbound ACL configurations, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (device crash) via a session involving a PPP over ATM (PPPoA) interface, aka Bug ID CSCte41827.
