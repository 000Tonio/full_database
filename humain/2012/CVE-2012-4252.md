Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in MySQLDumper 1.24.4 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) remove file access restriction via a deletehtaccess action, (2) drop a database via a kill value in a db action, (3) uninstall the application via a 101 value in the phase parameter to learn/cubemail/install.php, (4) delete config.php via a 2 value in the phase parameter to learn/cubemail/install.php, (5) change a password via a schutz action, or (6) execute arbitrary SQL commands via the sql_statement parameter to learn/cubemail/sql.php.
