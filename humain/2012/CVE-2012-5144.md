Google Chrome before 23.0.1271.97, and Libav 0.7.x before 0.7.7 and 0.8.x before 0.8.5, do not properly perform AAC decoding, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors related to "an off-by-one overwrite when switching to LTP profile from MAIN."

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
