DataNodes in Apache Hadoop 2.0.0 alpha does not check the BlockTokens of clients when Kerberos is enabled and the DataNode has checked out the same BlockPool twice from a NodeName, which might allow remote clients to read arbitrary blocks, write to blocks to which they only have read access, and have other unspecified impacts.
