Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in ZPanel 10.0.1 and earlier allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) create new FTP users via a CreateFTP action in the ftp_management module to the default URI, (2) conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via the inFullname parameter in an UpdateAccountSettings action in the my_account module to zpanel/, or (3) conduct SQL injection attacks via the inEmailAddress parameter in an UpdateClient action in the manage_clients module to the default URI.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
