The form-autocompletion functionality in Moodle 2.0.x before 2.0.7, 2.1.x before 2.1.4, and 2.2.x before 2.2.1 makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to discover passwords by reading the contents of a non-password field, as demonstrated by accessing a create-groups page with Safari on an iPad device.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
