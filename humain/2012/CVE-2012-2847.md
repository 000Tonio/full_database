Google Chrome before 21.0.1180.57 on Mac OS X and Linux, and before 21.0.1180.60 on Windows and Chrome Frame, does not request user confirmation before continuing a large series of downloads, which allows user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via a crafted web site.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
