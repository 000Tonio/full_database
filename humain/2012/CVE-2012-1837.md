The (1) webreports, (2) post/create-role, and (3) post/update-role programs in IBM Tivoli Endpoint Manager (TEM) before 8.2 do not include the HTTPOnly flag in a Set-Cookie header for a cookie, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information via script access to this cookie.
