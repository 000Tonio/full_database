Xen 4.0, and 4.1, when running a 64-bit PV guest on "older" AMD CPUs, does not properly protect against a certain AMD processor bug, which allows local guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host hang) via sequential execution of instructions across a non-canonical boundary, a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-0217.
