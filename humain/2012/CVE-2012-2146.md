Elixir 0.8.0 uses Blowfish in CFB mode without constructing a unique initialization vector (IV), which makes it easier for context-dependent users to obtain sensitive information and decrypt the database.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
