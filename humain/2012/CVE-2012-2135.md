The utf-16 decoder in Python 3.1 through 3.3 does not update the aligned_end variable after calling the unicode_decode_call_errorhandler function, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (process memory) or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and crash) via unspecified vectors.
