# CVE-2012-0833

- Published: 2012-07-03T16:40:00

- Modified: 2012-07-17T04:00:00

The acllas__handle_group_entry function in servers/plugins/acl/acllas.c in 389 Directory Server before 1.2.10 does not properly handled access control instructions (ACIs) that use certificate groups, which allows remote authenticated LDAP users with a certificate group to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and CPU consumption) by binding to the server.

### CVSS Score: **2.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
