- Published: 2012-08-07T21:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:31:00

The Magick_png_malloc function in coders/png.c in GraphicsMagick 6.7.8-6 does not use the proper variable type for the allocation size, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted PNG file that triggers incorrect memory allocation. Per: http://xforce.iss.net/xforce/xfdb/77259

'Platforms Affected: GraphicsMagick 1.3.16'
