PostgreSQL 8.4.x before 8.4.11, 9.0.x before 9.0.7, and 9.1.x before 9.1.3 truncates the common name to only 32 characters when verifying SSL certificates, which allows remote attackers to spoof connections when the host name is exactly 32 characters.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
