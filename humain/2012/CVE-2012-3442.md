The (1) django.http.HttpResponseRedirect and (2) django.http.HttpResponsePermanentRedirect classes in Django before 1.3.2 and 1.4.x before 1.4.1 do not validate the scheme of a redirect target, which might allow remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a data: URL.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
