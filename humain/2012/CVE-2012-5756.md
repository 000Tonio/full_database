The IBM WebSphere DataPower XC10 Appliance 2.0.0.0 through 2.0.0.3 and 2.1.0.0 through 2.1.0.2, when a collective configuration is enabled, has a single secret key that is shared across different customers' installations, which allows remote attackers to spoof a container server by (1) sniffing the network to locate a cleartext transmission of this key or (2) leveraging knowledge of this key from another installation.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
