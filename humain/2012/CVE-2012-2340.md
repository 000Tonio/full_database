- Modified: 2012-06-28T03:43:00

The Contact Forms module 7.x-1.x before 7.x-1.2 for Drupal does not specify sufficiently restrictive permissions, which allows remote authenticated users with the "access the site-wide contact form" permission to modify the module settings via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
