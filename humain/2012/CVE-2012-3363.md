Zend_XmlRpc in Zend Framework 1.x before 1.11.12 and 1.12.x before 1.12.0 does not properly handle SimpleXMLElement classes, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files or create TCP connections via an external entity reference in a DOCTYPE element in an XML-RPC request, aka an XML external entity (XXE) injection attack.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
