# CVE-2012-2722

- Published: 2012-06-27T00:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:31:00

The node selection interface in the WYSIWYG editor (CKEditor) in the Node Embed module 6.x-1.x before 6.x-1.5 and 7.x-1.x before 7.x-1.0 for Drupal does not properly check permissions, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and read node titles.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
