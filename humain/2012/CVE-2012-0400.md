EMC RSA enVision 4.x before 4.1 Patch 4 does not properly restrict the number of failed authentication attempts, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access via a brute-force attack.

### CVSS Score: **7.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
