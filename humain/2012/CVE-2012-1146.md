# CVE-2012-1146

- Published: 2012-05-17T11:00:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:33:00

The mem_cgroup_usage_unregister_event function in mm/memcontrol.c in the Linux kernel before 3.2.10 does not properly handle multiple events that are attached to the same eventfd, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by registering memory threshold events.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
