modules/m_capab.c in (1) ircd-ratbox before 3.0.8 and (2) Charybdis before 3.4.2 does not properly support capability negotiation during server handshakes, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and daemon crash) via a malformed request. Per http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html 'NULL Pointer Dereference'

### CVSS Score: **5**
