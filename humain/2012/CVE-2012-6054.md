The dissect_sflow_245_address_type function in epan/dissectors/packet-sflow.c in the sFlow dissector in Wireshark 1.8.x before 1.8.4 does not properly handle length calculations for an invalid IP address type, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a packet that is neither IPv4 nor IPv6.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
