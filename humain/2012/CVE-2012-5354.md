Mozilla Firefox before 16.0, Thunderbird before 16.0, and SeaMonkey before 2.13 do not properly handle navigation away from a web page that has multiple menus of SELECT elements active, which allows remote attackers to conduct clickjacking attacks via vectors involving an XPI file, the window.open method, and the Geolocation API, a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-3984.
