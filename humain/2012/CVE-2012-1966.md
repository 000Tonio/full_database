Mozilla Firefox 4.x through 13.0 and Firefox ESR 10.x before 10.0.6 do not have the same context-menu restrictions for data: URLs as for javascript: URLs, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a crafted URL.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
