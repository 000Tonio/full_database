Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client 3.0 through 3.0.08066 does not ensure that authentication makes use of a legitimate certificate, which allows user-assisted man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers via a crafted certificate, aka Bug ID CSCtz29197.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| --- | --- | --- |

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
