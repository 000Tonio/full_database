# CVE-2012-0950

- Published: 2012-06-19T20:55:00

- Modified: 2012-06-26T04:00:00

The Apport hook (DistUpgradeApport.py) in Update Manager, as used by Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, 11.10, and 11.04, uploads the /var/log/dist-upgrade directory when reporting bugs to Launchpad, which allows remote attackers to read repository credentials by viewing a public bug report.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-0949.
