# CVE-2012-3520

- Published: 2012-10-03T11:02:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:34:00

The Netlink implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.30 does not properly handle messages that lack SCM_CREDENTIALS data, which might allow local users to spoof Netlink communication via a crafted message, as demonstrated by a message to (1) Avahi or (2) NetworkManager.
