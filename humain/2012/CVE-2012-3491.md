src/condor_schedd.V6/schedd.cpp in Condor 7.6.x before 7.6.10 and 7.8.x before 7.8.4 does not properly check the permissions of jobs, which allows remote authenticated users to remove arbitrary idle jobs via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
