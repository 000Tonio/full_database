# CVE-2012-0655

- Published: 2012-05-11T03:49:00

- Modified: 2017-12-05T02:29:00

libsecurity in Apple Mac OS X before 10.7.4 does not properly restrict the length of RSA keys within X.509 certificates, which makes it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by conducting a spoofing or network-sniffing attack during communication with a site that uses a short key.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
