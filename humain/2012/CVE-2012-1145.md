- Published: 2012-06-16T00:55:00

- Modified: 2022-02-03T20:00:00

spacewalk-backend in Red Hat Network Satellite 5.4 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 does not properly authorize or authenticate uploads to the NULL organization when mod_wsgi is used, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (/var partition disk consumption and failed updates) via a large number of package uploads.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
