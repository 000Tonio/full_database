- Published: 2012-06-14T19:55:00

Opera before 11.65 does not properly restrict the opening of a pop-up window in response to the first click of a double-click action, which makes it easier for user-assisted remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or execute arbitrary code via a crafted web site.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
