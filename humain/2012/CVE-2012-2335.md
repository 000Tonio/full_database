# CVE-2012-2335

- Published: 2012-05-11T10:15:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:33:00

php-wrapper.fcgi does not properly handle command-line arguments, which allows remote attackers to bypass a protection mechanism in PHP 5.3.12 and 5.4.2 and execute arbitrary code by leveraging improper interaction between the PHP sapi/cgi/cgi_main.c component and a query string beginning with a +- sequence.
