# CVE-2012-2927

- Published: 2012-05-22T15:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:31:00

The TM Software Tempo plugin before 6.4.3.1, 6.5.x before 6.5.0.2, and 7.x before 7.0.3 for Atlassian JIRA does not properly restrict the capabilities of third-party XML parsers, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
