SystemTap 1.7, 1.6.7, and probably other versions, when unprivileged mode is enabled, allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory or cause a denial of service (kernel panic and crash) via vectors related to crafted DWARF data, which triggers a read of an invalid pointer.

### CVSS Score: **5.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | COMPLETE |
