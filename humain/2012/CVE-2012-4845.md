# CVE-2012-4845

- Published: 2012-10-20T10:41:00

The FTP client in IBM AIX 6.1 and 7.1, and VIOS 2.2.1.4-FP-25 SP-02, does not properly manage privileges in an RBAC environment, which allows attackers to bypass intended file-read restrictions by leveraging the setuid installation of the ftp executable file.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| COMPLETE | NONE | NONE |
