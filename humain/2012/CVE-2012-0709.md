IBM DB2 9.5 before FP9, 9.7 through FP5, and 9.8 through FP4 does not properly check variables, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended restrictions on viewing table data by leveraging the CREATEIN privilege to execute crafted SQL CREATE VARIABLE statements.

| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
