# CVE-2012-4195

- Published: 2012-10-29T18:55:00

- Modified: 2020-08-12T14:39:00

The nsLocation::CheckURL function in Mozilla Firefox before 16.0.2, Firefox ESR 10.x before 10.0.10, Thunderbird before 16.0.2, Thunderbird ESR 10.x before 10.0.10, and SeaMonkey before 2.13.2 does not properly determine the calling document and principal in its return value, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a crafted web site, and makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code by leveraging certain add-on behavior.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
