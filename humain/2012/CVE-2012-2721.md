# CVE-2012-2721

- Published: 2012-06-27T00:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:31:00

The default views in the Organic Groups (OG) module 6.x-2.x before 6.x-2.4 for Drupal do not properly check permissions when all users have the "access content" permission removed, which allows remote attackers to bypass access restrictions and possibly have other unspecified impact.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
