# CVE-2012-4405

- Published: 2012-09-18T17:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:34:00

Multiple integer underflows in the icmLut_allocate function in International Color Consortium (ICC) Format library (icclib), as used in Ghostscript 9.06 and Argyll Color Management System, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted (1) PostScript or (2) PDF file with embedded images, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow. NOTE: this issue is also described as an array index error.
