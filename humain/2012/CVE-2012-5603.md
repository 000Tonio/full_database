proxies_controller.rb in Katello in Red Hat CloudForms before 1.1 does not properly check permissions, which allows remote authenticated users to read consumer certificates or change arbitrary users' settings via unspecified vectors related to the "consumer UUID" of a system.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
