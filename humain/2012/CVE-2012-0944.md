- Published: 2012-06-04T20:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:31:00

Aptdaemon 0.43 and earlier in Ubuntu 11.04, 11.10, and 12.04 LTS does not authenticate packages when the transaction is not simulated, which allows remote attackers to install arbitrary packages via a man-in-the-middle attack.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
