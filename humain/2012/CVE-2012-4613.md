- Modified: 2013-02-26T04:50:00

EMC RSA Data Protection Manager Appliance 2.7.x and 3.x before 3.2.1 does not properly restrict the number of authentication attempts by a user account, which makes it easier for local users to bypass intended access restrictions via a brute-force attack.

### CVSS Score: **6.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
