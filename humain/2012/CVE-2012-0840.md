# CVE-2012-0840

- Published: 2012-02-10T19:55:00

- Modified: 2017-12-05T02:29:00

tables/apr_hash.c in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library through 1.4.5 computes hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
