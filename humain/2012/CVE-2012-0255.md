- Published: 2012-04-05T13:25:00

- Modified: 2018-01-18T02:29:00

The BGP implementation in bgpd in Quagga before 0.99.20.1 does not properly use message buffers for OPEN messages, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a message associated with a malformed Four-octet AS Number Capability (aka AS4 capability).

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
