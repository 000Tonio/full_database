# CVE-2012-3445

- Published: 2012-08-07T21:55:00

- Modified: 2013-03-22T03:11:00

The virTypedParameterArrayClear function in libvirt 0.9.13 does not properly handle virDomain* API calls with typed parameters, which might allow remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (libvirtd crash) via an RPC command with nparams set to zero, which triggers an out-of-bounds read or a free of an invalid pointer.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
