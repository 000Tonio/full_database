# CVE-2012-2131

- Published: 2012-04-24T20:55:00

- Modified: 2018-01-05T02:29:00

Multiple integer signedness errors in crypto/buffer/buffer.c in OpenSSL 0.9.8v allow remote attackers to conduct buffer overflow attacks, and cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact, via crafted DER data, as demonstrated by an X.509 certificate or an RSA public key.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-2110.
