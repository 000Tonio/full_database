# CVE-2012-3402

Integer overflow in plug-ins/common/psd.c in the Adobe Photoshop PSD plugin in GIMP 2.2.13 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted channels header value in a PSD image file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow, a different vulnerability than CVE-2009-3909.
