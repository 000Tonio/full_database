The GNTTABOP_swap_grant_ref sub-operation in the grant table hypercall in Xen 4.2 and Citrix XenServer 6.0.2 allows local guest kernels or administrators to cause a denial of service (host crash) and possibly gain privileges via a crafted grant reference that triggers a write to an arbitrary hypervisor memory location.
