McAfee Enterprise Mobility Manager (EMM) Agent before 4.8 and Server before 10.1 record all invalid usernames presented in failed login attempts, and place them on a list of accounts that an administrator may wish to unlock, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (excessive list size in the EMM Database) via a long sequence of login attempts with different usernames.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
