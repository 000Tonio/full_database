The Amazon Kindle Touch before 5.1.2 does not properly restrict access to the libkindleplugin.so NPAPI plugin interface, which might allow remote attackers to have an unspecified impact via vectors involving the (1) dev.log, (2) lipc.set, (3) lipc.get, or (4) todo.scheduleItems method, a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-4249.
