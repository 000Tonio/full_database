# CVE-2012-4487

- Published: 2012-11-02T15:55:00

- Modified: 2012-11-05T14:38:00

The Subuser module before 6.x-1.8 for Drupal does not properly check "switch subuser" permissions, which allows remote authenticated parent users to change their role by switching to a subuser they created.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
