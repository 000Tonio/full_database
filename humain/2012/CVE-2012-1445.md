# CVE-2012-1445

- Published: 2012-03-21T10:11:00

- Modified: 2012-07-10T04:28:00

The ELF file parser in eSafe 7.0.17.0, Rising Antivirus 22.83.00.03, Fortinet Antivirus 4.2.254.0, and Panda Antivirus 10.0.2.7 allows remote attackers to bypass malware detection via an ELF file with a modified abi field.  NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional information is published showing that the error occurred independently in different ELF parser implementations.
