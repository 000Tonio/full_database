Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in FlexCMS 3.2.1 and earlier allow remote attackers to (1) hijack the authentication of users for requests that change account settings via a request to index.php/profile-edit-save or (2) hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that add a new page via a request to admin/pages-new-save.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
