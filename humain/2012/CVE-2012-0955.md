software-properties was vulnerable to a person-in-the-middle attack due to incorrect TLS certificate validation in softwareproperties/ppa.py. software-properties didn't check TLS certificates under python2 and only checked certificates under python3 if a valid certificate bundle was provided. Fixed in software-properties version 0.92.
