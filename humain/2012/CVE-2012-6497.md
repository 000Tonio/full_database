The Authlogic gem for Ruby on Rails, when used with certain versions before 3.2.10, makes potentially unsafe find_by_id method calls, which might allow remote attackers to conduct CVE-2012-6496 SQL injection attacks via a crafted parameter in environments that have a known secret_token value, as demonstrated by a value contained in secret_token.rb in an open-source product.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
