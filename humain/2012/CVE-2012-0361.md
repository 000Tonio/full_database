- Published: 2012-05-02T10:09:00

The sccp-protocol component in Cisco IP Communicator (CIPC) 7.0 through 8.6 does not limit the rate of SCCP messages to Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM), which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via vectors that trigger (1) on hook and (2) off hook messages, as demonstrated by a Plantronics headset, aka Bug ID CSCti40315.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
