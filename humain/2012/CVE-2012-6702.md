Expat, when used in a parser that has not called XML_SetHashSalt or passed it a seed of 0, makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms via vectors involving use of the srand function.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
