# CVE-2012-5627

- Published: 2013-10-01T17:55:00

- Modified: 2022-08-29T20:56:00

Oracle MySQL and MariaDB 5.5.x before 5.5.29, 5.3.x before 5.3.12, and 5.2.x before 5.2.14 does not modify the salt during multiple executions of the change_user command within the same connection which makes it easier for remote authenticated users to conduct brute force password guessing attacks.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
