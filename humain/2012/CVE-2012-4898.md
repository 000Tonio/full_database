Mesh OS before 7.9.1.1 on Tropos wireless mesh routers does not use a sufficient source of entropy for SSH keys, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof a device or modify a client-server data stream by leveraging knowledge of a key from a product installation elsewhere.

### CVSS Score: **6.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | PARTIAL | NONE |
