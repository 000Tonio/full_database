# CVE-2012-3424

- Published: 2012-08-08T10:26:00

The decode_credentials method in actionpack/lib/action_controller/metal/http_authentication.rb in Ruby on Rails 3.x before 3.0.16, 3.1.x before 3.1.7, and 3.2.x before 3.2.7 converts Digest Authentication strings to symbols, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by leveraging access to an application that uses a with_http_digest helper method, as demonstrated by the authenticate_or_request_with_http_digest method.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
