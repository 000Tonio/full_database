The agent in Bradford Network Sentry before 5.3.3 does not require authentication for messages, which allows remote attackers to trigger the display of arbitrary text on a workstation via a crafted packet to UDP port 4567, as demonstrated by a replay attack.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
