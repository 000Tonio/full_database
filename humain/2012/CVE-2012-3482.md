# CVE-2012-3482

- Published: 2012-12-21T05:46:00

Fetchmail 5.0.8 through 6.3.21, when using NTLM authentication in debug mode, allows remote NTLM servers to (1) cause a denial of service (crash and delayed delivery of inbound mail) via a crafted NTLM response that triggers an out-of-bounds read in the base64 decoder, or (2) obtain sensitive information from memory via an NTLM Type 2 message with a crafted Target Name structure, which triggers an out-of-bounds read.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | PARTIAL |
