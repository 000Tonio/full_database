JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (aka JBoss EAP or JBEAP) before 6.0.1, when using role-based authorization for Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) access, does not call the intended authorization modules, which prevents JACC permissions from being applied and allows remote attackers to obtain access to the EJB. Per https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=870871#c7
"This issue did not affect JBoss Enterprise Application Platform versions 4.x and 5.x."
