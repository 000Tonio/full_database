# CVE-2012-2674

- Published: 2012-07-25T19:55:00

Multiple integer overflows in the (1) chk_malloc, (2) leak_malloc, and (3) leak_memalign functions in libc/bionic/malloc_debug_leak.c in Bionic (libc) for Android, when libc.debug.malloc is set, make it easier for context-dependent attackers to perform memory-related attacks such as buffer overflows via a large size value, which causes less memory to be allocated than expected.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
