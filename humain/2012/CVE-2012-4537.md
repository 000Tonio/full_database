- Published: 2012-11-21T23:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:32:00

Xen 3.4 through 4.2, and possibly earlier versions, does not properly synchronize the p2m and m2p tables when the set_p2m_entry function fails, which allows local HVM guest OS administrators to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and assertion failure), aka "Memory mapping failure DoS vulnerability."

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
