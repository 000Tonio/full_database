Sielco Sistemi Winlog Pro SCADA before 2.07.17 and Winlog Lite SCADA before 2.07.17 do not validate the return value of the realloc function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid 0x00 write operation and daemon crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a port-46824 TCP packet with a crafted positive integer after the opcode.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**
