Moxa OnCell Gateway G3111, G3151, G3211, and G3251 devices with firmware before 1.4 do not use a sufficient source of entropy for SSH and SSL keys, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access by leveraging knowledge of a key from a product installation elsewhere.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
