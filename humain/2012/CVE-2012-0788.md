# CVE-2012-0788

- Published: 2012-02-14T15:55:00

- Modified: 2018-01-09T02:29:00

The PDORow implementation in PHP before 5.3.9 does not properly interact with the session feature, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted application that uses a PDO driver for a fetch and then calls the session_start function, as demonstrated by a crash of the Apache HTTP Server.

### CVSS Score: **5**
