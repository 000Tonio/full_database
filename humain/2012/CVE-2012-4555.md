The token processing system (pki-tps) in Red Hat Certificate System (RHCS) before 8.1.3 does not properly handle interruptions of token format operations, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and Apache httpd web server child process crash) via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |
