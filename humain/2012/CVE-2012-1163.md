Integer overflow in the _zip_readcdir function in zip_open.c in libzip 0.10 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via the size and offset values for the central directory in a zip archive, which triggers "improper restrictions of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer" and an information leak.
