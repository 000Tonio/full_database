# CVE-2012-3492

- Published: 2012-09-28T17:55:00

- Modified: 2012-10-03T04:00:00

The filesystem authentication (condor_io/condor_auth_fs.cpp) in Condor 7.6.x before 7.6.10 and 7.8.x before 7.8.4 uses authentication directories even when they have weak permissions, which allows remote attackers to impersonate users by renaming a user's authentication directory.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
