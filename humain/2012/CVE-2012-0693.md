# CVE-2012-0693

- Published: 2012-01-14T03:57:00

** DISPUTED ** submitticket.php in WHMCompleteSolution (WHMCS) 5.03 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary code into a subject field via crafted ticket data, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-5061. NOTE: the vendor disputes this issue, noting that some of the details overlap CVE-2011-5061, but that it "says it affects V5.0.3, and the submitticket.php file, both of which are wrong."

### CVSS Score: **5**
