- Published: 2012-03-19T21:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:31:00

fcgid_spawn_ctl.c in the mod_fcgid module 2.3.6 for the Apache HTTP Server does not recognize the FcgidMaxProcessesPerClass directive for a virtual host, which makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a series of HTTP requests that triggers a process count higher than the intended limit.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
