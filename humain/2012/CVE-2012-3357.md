# CVE-2012-3357

- Published: 2012-07-22T16:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:31:00

The SVN revision view (lib/vclib/svn/svn_repos.py) in ViewVC before 1.1.15 does not properly handle log messages when a readable path is copied from an unreadable path, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information, related to a "log msg leak."

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
