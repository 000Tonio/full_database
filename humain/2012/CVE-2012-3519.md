- Published: 2012-08-26T03:17:00

- Modified: 2013-08-22T03:56:00

routerlist.c in Tor before 0.2.2.38 uses a different amount of time for relay-list iteration depending on which relay is chosen, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information about relay selection via a timing side-channel attack.

### CVSS Score: **5**
