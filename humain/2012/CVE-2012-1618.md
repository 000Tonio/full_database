# CVE-2012-1618

- Published: 2012-10-06T22:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:33:00

Interaction error in the PostgreSQL JDBC driver before 8.2, when used with a PostgreSQL server with the "standard_conforming_strings" option enabled, such as the default configuration of PostgreSQL 9.1, does not properly escape unspecified JDBC statement parameters, which allows remote attackers to perform SQL injection attacks. NOTE: as of 20120330, it was claimed that the upstream developer planned to dispute this issue, but an official dispute has not been posted as of 20121005.
