# CVE-2012-2675

- Published: 2012-07-25T19:55:00

- Modified: 2012-07-30T04:00:00

Multiple integer overflows in the (1) CallMalloc (malloc) and (2) nedpcalloc (calloc) functions in nedmalloc (nedmalloc.c) before 1.10 beta2 make it easier for context-dependent attackers to perform memory-related attacks such as buffer overflows via a large size value, which causes less memory to be allocated than expected.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
