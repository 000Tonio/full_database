Moodle 2.1.x before 2.1.6 and 2.2.x before 2.2.3 allows remote authenticated users to bypass the moodle/site:readallmessages capability requirement and read arbitrary messages by using the "Recent conversations" feature with a modified parameter in a URL.

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
