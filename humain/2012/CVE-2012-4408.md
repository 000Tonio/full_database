- Published: 2012-09-19T10:57:00

course/reset.php in Moodle 2.1.x before 2.1.8, 2.2.x before 2.2.5, and 2.3.x before 2.3.2 checks an update capability instead of a reset capability, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via a reset operation.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
