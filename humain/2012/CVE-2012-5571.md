# CVE-2012-5571

- Published: 2012-12-18T01:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:32:00

OpenStack Keystone Essex (2012.1) and Folsom (2012.2) does not properly handle EC2 tokens when the user role has been removed from a tenant, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended authorization restrictions by leveraging a token for the removed user role.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
