# CVE-2012-3383

- Published: 2012-07-22T17:55:00

- Modified: 2012-09-18T03:35:00

The map_meta_cap function in wp-includes/capabilities.php in WordPress 3.4.x before 3.4.2, when the multisite feature is enabled, does not properly assign the unfiltered_html capability, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by leveraging the Administrator or Editor role and composing crafted text.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
