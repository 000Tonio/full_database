Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in Wolf CMS 0.75 and earlier allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) delete users via the user id number to admin/user/delete; (2) delete pages via the page id number to admin/page/delete; delete the (3) images or (4) themes directory via the directory name to admin/plugin/file_manager/delete, and possibly other directories; or (5) logout the user via a request to admin/login/logout.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
