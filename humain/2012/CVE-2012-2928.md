- Published: 2012-05-22T15:55:00

- Modified: 2022-05-14T03:25:00

The Gliffy plugin before 3.7.1 for Atlassian JIRA, and before 4.2 for Atlassian Confluence, does not properly restrict the capabilities of third-party XML parsers, which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files or cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | PARTIAL |
