- Published: 2012-07-12T20:55:00

- Modified: 2016-12-07T17:43:00

The default configuration of the auth/saml plugin in Mahara before 1.4.2 sets the "Match username attribute to Remote username" option to false, which allows remote SAML IdP servers to spoof users of other SAML IdP servers by using the same internal username.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
