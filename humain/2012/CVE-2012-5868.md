WordPress 3.4.2 does not invalidate a wordpress_sec session cookie upon an administrator's logout action, which makes it easier for remote attackers to discover valid session identifiers via a brute-force attack, or modify data via a replay attack.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
