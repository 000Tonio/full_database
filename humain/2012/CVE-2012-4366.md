Belkin wireless routers Surf N150 Model F7D1301v1, N900 Model F9K1104v1, N450 Model F9K1105V2, and N300 Model F7D2301v1 generate a predictable default WPA2-PSK passphrase based on eight digits of the WAN MAC address, which allows remote attackers to access the network by sniffing the beacon frames.

### CVSS Score: **3.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |
