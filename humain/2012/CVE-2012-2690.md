# CVE-2012-2690

- Published: 2012-06-29T19:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:31:00

virt-edit in libguestfs before 1.18.0 does not preserve the permissions from the original file and saves the new file with world-readable permissions when editing, which might allow local guest users to obtain sensitive information.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
