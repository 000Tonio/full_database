Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in Mibew Messenger 1.6.4 and earlier allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of operators for requests that insert cross-site scripting (XSS) sequences via the (1) address or (2) threadid parameters to operator/ban.php; or (3) geolinkparams, (4) title, or (5) chattitle parameters to operator/settings.php.
