The IronJacamar container before 1.0.12.Final for JBoss Application Server, when allow-multiple-users is enabled in conjunction with a security domain, does not use the credentials supplied in a getConnection function call, which allows remote attackers to obtain access to an arbitrary datasource connection in opportunistic circumstances via an invalid connection attempt.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
