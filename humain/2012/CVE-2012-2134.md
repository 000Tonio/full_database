# CVE-2012-2134

- Published: 2014-02-26T15:55:00

- Modified: 2014-03-10T19:18:00

The handle_connection_error function in ldap_helper.c in bind-dyndb-ldap before 1.1.0rc1 does not properly handle LDAP query errors, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and named server hang) via a non-alphabet character in the base DN in an LDAP search DNS query.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
