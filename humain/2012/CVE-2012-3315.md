# CVE-2012-3315

- Published: 2012-11-08T11:46:00

The Java servlets in the management console in IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager (TFIM) through 6.2.2 and Tivoli Federated Identity Manager Business Gateway (TFIMBG) before 6.2.2 do not require authentication for all resource downloads, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended J2EE security constraints, and obtain sensitive information related to (1) federation metadata or (2) a web plugin configuration template, via a crafted request.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
