The ELF file parser in Dr.Web 5.0.2.03300, eSafe 7.0.17.0, McAfee Gateway (formerly Webwasher) 2010.1C, Rising Antivirus 22.83.00.03, Fortinet Antivirus 4.2.254.0, and Panda Antivirus 10.0.2.7 allows remote attackers to bypass malware detection via an ELF file with a modified ei_version field.  NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional information is published showing that the error occurred independently in different ELF parser implementations.
