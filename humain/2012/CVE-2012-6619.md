# CVE-2012-6619

- Published: 2014-03-06T15:55:00

- Modified: 2014-05-07T03:45:00

The default configuration for MongoDB before 2.3.2 does not validate objects, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (crash) or read system memory via a crafted BSON object in the column name in an insert command, which triggers a buffer over-read.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | PARTIAL |
