# CVE-2012-0045

- Published: 2012-07-03T16:40:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T03:24:00

The em_syscall function in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2.14 does not properly handle the 0f05 (aka syscall) opcode, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) via a crafted application, as demonstrated by an NASM file.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |
