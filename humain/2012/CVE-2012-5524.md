- Published: 2014-02-08T00:55:00

- Modified: 2014-02-10T15:16:00

The _ssl_verify_callback function in tls_nb.py in Gajim before 0.15.3 does not properly verify SSL certificates, which allows remote attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and spoof servers via an arbitrary certificate from a trusted CA.
