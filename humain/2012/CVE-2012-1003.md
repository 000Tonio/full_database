# CVE-2012-1003

- Published: 2012-02-07T04:09:00

Multiple integer overflows in Opera 11.60 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a large integer argument to the (1) Int32Array, (2) Float32Array, (3) Float64Array, (4) Uint32Array, (5) Int16Array, or (6) ArrayBuffer function.  NOTE: the vendor reportedly characterizes this as "a stability issue, not a security issue."
