login.php on the Sinapsi eSolar Light Photovoltaic System Monitor (aka Schneider Electric Ezylog photovoltaic SCADA management server), Sinapsi eSolar, and Sinapsi eSolar DUO with firmware before 2.0.2870_2.2.12 establishes multiple hardcoded accounts, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain administrative access by leveraging a (1) cleartext password or (2) password hash contained in this script, as demonstrated by a password of astridservice or 36e44c9b64.
