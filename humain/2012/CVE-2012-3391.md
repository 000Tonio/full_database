# CVE-2012-3391

- Published: 2012-07-23T21:55:00

- Modified: 2020-12-01T14:43:00

mod/forum/rsslib.php in Moodle 2.1.x before 2.1.7 and 2.2.x before 2.2.4 does not properly implement the requirement for posting before reading a Q&A forum, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging the student role and reading the RSS feed for a forum.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
