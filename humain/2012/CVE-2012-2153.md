- Published: 2012-10-01T00:55:00

- Modified: 2013-12-13T04:59:00

Drupal 7.x before 7.14 does not properly restrict access to nodes in a list when using a "contributed node access module," which allows remote authenticated users with the "Access the content overview page" permission to read all published nodes by accessing the admin/content page.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
