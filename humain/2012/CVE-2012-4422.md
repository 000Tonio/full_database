wp-admin/plugins.php in WordPress before 3.4.2, when the multisite feature is enabled, does not check for network-administrator privileges before performing a network-wide activation of an installed plugin, which might allow remote authenticated users to make unintended plugin changes by leveraging the Administrator role.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
