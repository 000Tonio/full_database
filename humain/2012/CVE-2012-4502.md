- Modified: 2013-11-06T19:25:00

Multiple integer overflows in pktlength.c in Chrony before 1.29 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted (1) REQ_SUBNETS_ACCESSED or (2) REQ_CLIENT_ACCESSES command request to the PKL_CommandLength function or crafted (3) RPY_SUBNETS_ACCESSED, (4) RPY_CLIENT_ACCESSES, (5) RPY_CLIENT_ACCESSES_BY_INDEX, or (6) RPY_MANUAL_LIST command reply to the PKL_ReplyLength function, which triggers an out-of-bounds read or buffer overflow.  NOTE: versions 1.27 and 1.28 do not require authentication to exploit.

### CVSS Score: **5**
