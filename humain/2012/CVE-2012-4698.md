# CVE-2012-4698

- Published: 2012-12-23T21:55:00

Siemens RuggedCom Rugged Operating System (ROS) before 3.12, ROX I OS through 1.14.5, ROX II OS through 2.3.0, and RuggedMax OS through 4.2.1.4621.22 use hardcoded private keys for SSL and SSH communication, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and decrypt network traffic by leveraging the availability of these keys within ROS files at all customer installations.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
