- Published: 2012-06-07T19:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:31:00

Openstack Compute (Nova) Folsom, 2012.1, and 2011.3 does not limit the number of security group rules, which allows remote authenticated users with certain permissions to cause a denial of service (CPU and hard drive consumption) via a network request that triggers a large number of iptables rules.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
