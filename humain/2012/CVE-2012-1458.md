# CVE-2012-1458

- Published: 2012-03-21T10:11:00

- Modified: 2018-01-18T02:29:00

The Microsoft CHM file parser in ClamAV 0.96.4 and Sophos Anti-Virus 4.61.0 allows remote attackers to bypass malware detection via a crafted reset interval in the LZXC header of a CHM file.  NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional information is published showing that the error occurred independently in different CHM parser implementations.
