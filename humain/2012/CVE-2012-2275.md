Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in TestLink 1.9.3 and earlier allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of users for requests that add, delete, or modify sensitive information, as demonstrated by changing the administrator's email via an editUser action to lib/usermanagement/userInfo.php.
