The HostScan downloader implementation in Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client 3.x before 3.0 MR8 and Cisco Secure Desktop before 3.6.6020 does not compare the timestamp of offered software to the timestamp of installed software, which allows remote attackers to force a version downgrade by using (1) ActiveX or (2) Java components to offer signed code that corresponds to an older software release, aka Bug ID CSCtx74235.
