The Backend History Module in TYPO3 4.5.x before 4.5.21, 4.6.x before 4.6.14, and 4.7.x before 4.7.6 does not properly restrict access, which allows remote authenticated editors to read the history of arbitrary records via a crafted URL.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
