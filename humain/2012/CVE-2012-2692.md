- Published: 2012-06-17T03:41:00

- Modified: 2021-01-12T18:05:00

MantisBT before 1.2.11 does not check the delete_attachments_threshold permission when form_security_validation is set to OFF, which allows remote authenticated users with certain privileges to bypass intended access restrictions and delete arbitrary attachments.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
