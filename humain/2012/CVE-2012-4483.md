The commons_discussion_views_default_views function in modules/features/commons_discussion/commons_discussion.views_default.inc in the Drupal Commons module 6.x-2.x before 6.x-2.8 for Drupal does not properly enforce intended node access restrictions, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via the recent comments listing.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| --- | --- | --- |
