The Flex-VPN load-balancing feature in the ipsec-ikev2 implementation in Cisco IOS before 15.1(1)SY3 does not require authentication, which allows remote attackers to trigger the forwarding of VPN traffic to an attacker-controlled destination, or the discarding of this traffic, by arranging for an arbitrary device to become a cluster member, aka Bug ID CSCub93641.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
