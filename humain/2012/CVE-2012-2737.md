- Published: 2012-07-22T17:55:00

The user_change_icon_file_authorized_cb function in /usr/libexec/accounts-daemon in AccountsService before 0.6.22 does not properly check the UID when copying an icon file to the system cache directory, which allows local users to read arbitrary files via a race condition.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
