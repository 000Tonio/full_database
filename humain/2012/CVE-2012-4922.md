# CVE-2012-4922

- Published: 2012-09-14T18:55:00

- Modified: 2013-08-22T03:59:00

The tor_timegm function in common/util.c in Tor before 0.2.2.39, and 0.2.3.x before 0.2.3.22-rc, does not properly validate time values, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a malformed directory object, a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-4419.

### CVSS Score: **5**
