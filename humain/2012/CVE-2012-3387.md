Moodle 2.3.x before 2.3.1 uses only a client-side check for whether references are permitted in a file upload, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended alias (aka shortcut) restrictions via a client that omits this check.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
