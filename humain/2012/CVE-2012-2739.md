# CVE-2012-2739

- Published: 2012-11-28T13:03:00

- Modified: 2012-11-28T13:03:00

Oracle Java SE before 7 Update 6, and OpenJDK 7 before 7u6 build 12 and 8 before build 39, computes hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via crafted input to an application that maintains a hash table.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
