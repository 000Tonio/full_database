- Modified: 2023-02-13T03:24:00

OpenSSL 0.9.8s and 1.0.0f does not properly support DTLS applications, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via unspecified vectors related to an out-of-bounds read. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2011-4108.

### CVSS Score: **5**
