The Multi-Authentication feature in the Central Authentication Service (CAS) functionality in auth/cas/cas_form.html in Moodle 2.1.x before 2.1.6 and 2.2.x before 2.2.3 does not use HTTPS, which allows remote attackers to obtain credentials by sniffing the network.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
