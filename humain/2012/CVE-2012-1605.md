- Published: 2012-09-04T20:55:00

- Modified: 2012-09-05T13:46:00

The Extbase Framework in TYPO3 4.6.x through 4.6.6, 4.7, and 6.0 unserializes untrusted data, which allows remote attackers to unserialize arbitrary objects and possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors related to "a missing signature (HMAC) for a request argument."

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
