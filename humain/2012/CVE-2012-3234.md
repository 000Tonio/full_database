RealNetworks RealPlayer before 15.0.6.14, RealPlayer SP 1.0 through 1.1.5, and Mac RealPlayer before 12.0.1.1750 do not properly handle codec frame sizes in RealAudio files, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file.
