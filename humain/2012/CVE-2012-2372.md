The rds_ib_xmit function in net/rds/ib_send.c in the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel 3.7.4 and earlier allows local users to cause a denial of service (BUG_ON and kernel panic) by establishing an RDS connection with the source IP address equal to the IPoIB interface's own IP address, as demonstrated by rds-ping.
