Mozilla Firefox before 16.0, Thunderbird before 16.0, and SeaMonkey before 2.13 do not properly perform a cast of an unspecified variable during use of the instanceof operator on a JavaScript object, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (assertion failure) via a crafted web site.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
