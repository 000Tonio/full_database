IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager (TFIM) 6.2.0 before 6.2.0.11, 6.2.1 before 6.2.1.3, and 6.2.2 before 6.2.2.2 and Tivoli Federated Identity Manager Business Gateway (TFIMBG) 6.2.0 before 6.2.0.11, 6.2.1 before 6.2.1.3, and 6.2.2 before 6.2.2.2 do not check whether an OpenID attribute is signed in the (1) SREG (aka simple registration extension) and (2) AX (aka attribute exchange extension) cases, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof OpenID provider data by inserting unsigned attributes.
