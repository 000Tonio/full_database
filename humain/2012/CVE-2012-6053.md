epan/dissectors/packet-usb.c in the USB dissector in Wireshark 1.6.x before 1.6.12 and 1.8.x before 1.8.4 relies on a length field to calculate an offset value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a zero value for this field.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
