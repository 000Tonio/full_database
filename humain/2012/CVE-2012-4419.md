The compare_tor_addr_to_addr_policy function in or/policies.c in Tor before 0.2.2.39, and 0.2.3.x before 0.2.3.21-rc, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a zero-valued port field that is not properly handled during policy comparison.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
