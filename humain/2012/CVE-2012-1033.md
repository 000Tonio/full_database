# CVE-2012-1033

- Published: 2012-02-08T20:55:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

The resolver in ISC BIND 9 through 9.8.1-P1 overwrites cached server names and TTL values in NS records during the processing of a response to an A record query, which allows remote attackers to trigger continued resolvability of revoked domain names via a "ghost domain names" attack. Per: https://www.isc.org/software/bind/advisories/cve-2012-1033

'Solution: 

On further review, ISC has determined that this is not an issue which needs an immediate patch. The issue is being reviewed at the protocol level and will be addressed there. Implementing DNSSEC is the safest mitigation measure.'
