# CVE-2012-3446

- Published: 2012-11-04T22:55:00

- Modified: 2012-11-06T05:00:00

Apache Libcloud before 0.11.1 uses an incorrect regular expression during verification of whether the server hostname matches a domain name in the subject's Common Name (CN) or subjectAltName field of the X.509 certificate, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a crafted certificate.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
