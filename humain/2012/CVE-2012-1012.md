# CVE-2012-1012

- Published: 2012-06-07T19:55:00

- Modified: 2020-01-21T15:46:00

server/server_stubs.c in the kadmin protocol implementation in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.10 before 1.10.1 does not properly restrict access to (1) SET_STRING and (2) GET_STRINGS operations, which might allow remote authenticated administrators to modify or read string attributes by leveraging the global list privilege.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
