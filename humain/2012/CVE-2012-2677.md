# CVE-2012-2677

- Published: 2012-07-25T19:55:00

- Modified: 2021-05-26T10:15:00

Integer overflow in the ordered_malloc function in boost/pool/pool.hpp in Boost Pool before 3.9 makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to perform memory-related attacks such as buffer overflows via a large memory chunk size value, which causes less memory to be allocated than expected.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
