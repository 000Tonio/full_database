# CVE-2012-1118

- Published: 2012-06-29T19:55:00

- Modified: 2013-08-27T03:21:00

The access_has_bug_level function in core/access_api.php in MantisBT before 1.2.9 does not properly restrict access when the private_bug_view_threshold is set to an array, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended restrictions and perform certain operations on private bug reports.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
