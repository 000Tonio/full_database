lib/filelib.php in Moodle 2.1.x before 2.1.7 and 2.2.x before 2.2.4 does not properly restrict file access after a block has been hidden, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information by reading a file that is embedded in a block.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
