Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in main.php in Contao (formerly TYPOlight) 2.11.0 and earlier allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) delete users via a delete action in the user module, (2) delete news via a delete action in the news module, or (3) delete newsletters via a delete action in the newsletters module.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
