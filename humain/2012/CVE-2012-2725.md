# CVE-2012-2725

- Published: 2012-06-27T00:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:31:00

classes/Filter/WhitelistedExternalFilter.php in the Authoring HTML module 6.x-1.x before 6.x-1.1 for Drupal does not properly validate sources with the host white list, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
