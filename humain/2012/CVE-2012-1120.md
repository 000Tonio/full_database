# CVE-2012-1120

- Published: 2012-06-29T19:55:00

- Modified: 2021-01-12T18:05:00

The SOAP API in MantisBT before 1.2.9 does not properly enforce the bugnote_allow_user_edit_delete and delete_bug_threshold permissions, which allows remote authenticated users with read and write SOAP API privileges to delete arbitrary bug reports and bug notes.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
