The Linux Console on the WAGO I/O System 758 model 758-870, 758-874, 758-875, and 758-876 Industrial PC (IPC) devices has a default password of wago for the (1) root and (2) admin accounts, (3) a default password of user for the user account, and (4) a default password of guest for the guest account, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain login access via a TELNET session, a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-3013.
