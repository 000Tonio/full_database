# CVE-2012-3429

- Published: 2012-08-07T21:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:31:00

The dns_to_ldap_dn_escape function in src/ldap_convert.c in bind-dyndb-ldap 1.1.0rc1 and earlier does not properly escape distinguished names (DN) for LDAP queries, which allows remote DNS servers to cause a denial of service (named service hang) via a "$" character in a DN in a DNS query.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
