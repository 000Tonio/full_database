Bloxx Web Filtering before 5.0.14 does not properly interpret X-Forwarded-For headers during access-control and logging operations for HTTPS connection attempts, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended IP address and domain restrictions, and trigger misleading log entries, via a crafted header.

### CVSS Score: **5**
