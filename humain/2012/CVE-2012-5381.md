# CVE-2012-5381

- Published: 2012-10-11T10:51:00

- Modified: 2013-03-02T04:47:00

** DISPUTED ** Untrusted search path vulnerability in the installation functionality in PHP 5.3.17, when installed in the top-level C:\ directory, might allow local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse DLL in the C:\PHP directory, which may be added to the PATH system environment variable by an administrator, as demonstrated by a Trojan horse wlbsctrl.dll file used by the "IKE and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules" system service in Windows Vista SP1, Windows Server 2008 SP2, Windows 7 SP1, and Windows 8 Release Preview.  NOTE: CVE disputes this issue because the unsafe PATH is established only by a separate administrative action that is not a default part of the PHP installation. Per: http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/426.html 'CWE-426 Untrusted Search Path'
