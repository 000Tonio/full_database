Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Subrion CMS 2.2.1 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) multi_title parameter to blocks/add/; (2) cost, (3) days, or (4) title[en] parameter to plans/add/; (5) name or (6) title[en] parameter to fields/group/add/ in admin/manage/; or (7) f[accounts][fullname] or (8) f[accounts][username] parameter to advsearch/.
