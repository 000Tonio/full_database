- Published: 2012-07-17T21:55:00

- Modified: 2012-08-24T04:00:00

The Nova scheduler in OpenStack Compute (Nova) Folsom (2012.2) and Essex (2012.1), when DifferentHostFilter or SameHostFilter is enabled, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (excessive database lookup calls and server hang) via a request with many repeated IDs in the os:scheduler_hints section.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
