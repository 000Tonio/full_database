Multiple buffer overflows in FlightGear 2.6 and earlier and SimGear 2.6 and earlier allow user-assisted remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a (1) long string in a rotor tag of an aircraft xml model to the Rotor::getValueforFGSet function in src/FDM/YASim/Rotor.cpp or (2) a crafted UDP packet to the SGSocketUDP::read function in simgear/simgear/simgear/io/sg_socket_udp.cxx.
