The Management Software application in GarrettCom Magnum MNS-6K before 4.4.0, and 14.x before 14.4.0, has a hardcoded password for an administrative account, which allows local users to gain privileges via unspecified vectors. Per http://www.us-cert.gov/control_systems/pdf/ICSA-12-243-01.pdf 

"An attacker with access to an established user account could remotely log into the affected system and elevate privileges to the administrative level, thereby circumventing the physical connect safeguards in place for administrative functions."
