MaraDNS before 1.3.07.12 and 1.4.x before 1.4.08 computes hash values for DNS data without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by sending many crafted queries with the Recursion Desired (RD) bit set.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |
