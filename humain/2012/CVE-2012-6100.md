# CVE-2012-6100

- Published: 2013-01-27T22:55:00

- Modified: 2020-12-01T14:52:00

report/outline/index.php in Moodle 2.2.x before 2.2.7, 2.3.x before 2.3.4, and 2.4.x before 2.4.1 does not properly enforce the moodle/user:viewhiddendetails capability requirement, which allows remote authenticated users to discover a hidden lastaccess value by reading an activity report.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
