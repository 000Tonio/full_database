# CVE-2012-2673

- Published: 2012-07-25T19:55:00

- Modified: 2016-09-29T01:59:00

Multiple integer overflows in the (1) GC_generic_malloc and (2) calloc functions in malloc.c, and the (3) GC_generic_malloc_ignore_off_page function in mallocx.c in Boehm-Demers-Weiser GC (libgc) before 7.2 make it easier for context-dependent attackers to perform memory-related attacks such as buffer overflows via a large size value, which causes less memory to be allocated than expected.

### CVSS Score: **5**
