The kdc_handle_protected_negotiation function in the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.8.x, 1.9.x before 1.9.5, and 1.10.x before 1.10.3 attempts to calculate a checksum before verifying that the key type is appropriate for a checksum, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (uninitialized pointer free, heap memory corruption, and daemon crash) via a crafted AS-REQ request.
