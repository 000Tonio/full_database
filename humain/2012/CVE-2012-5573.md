# CVE-2012-5573

- Published: 2013-01-01T12:35:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:32:00

The connection_edge_process_relay_cell function in or/relay.c in Tor before 0.2.3.25 maintains circuits even if an unexpected SENDME cell arrives, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption or excessive cell reception rate) or bypass intended flow-control restrictions via a RELAY_COMMAND_SENDME command.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
