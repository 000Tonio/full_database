# CVE-2012-6038

- Published: 2012-11-26T22:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:32:00

admin/core/admin_func.php in razorCMS before 1.2.1 does not properly restrict access to certain administrator directories and files, which allows remote authenticated users to read, edit, rename, move, copy and delete files via the (1) dir parameter in a fileman or (2) filemanview action.  NOTE: this issue has been referred to as a "path traversal."
