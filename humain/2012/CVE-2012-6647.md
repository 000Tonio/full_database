# CVE-2012-6647

- Published: 2014-05-26T22:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:38:00

The futex_wait_requeue_pi function in kernel/futex.c in the Linux kernel before 3.5.1 does not ensure that calls have two different futex addresses, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI command.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
