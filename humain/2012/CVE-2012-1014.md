The process_as_req function in the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.10.x before 1.10.3 does not initialize a certain structure member, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (uninitialized pointer dereference and daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a malformed AS-REQ request.
