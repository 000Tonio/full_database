- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:31:00

The python SDK before 3.1.0.6 and CLI before 3.1.0.8 for oVirt 3.1 does not check the server SSL certificate against the client keys, which allows remote attackers to spoof a server via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
