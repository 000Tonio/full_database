- Published: 2013-01-03T01:55:00

Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in the (1) twikidraw (action/twikidraw.py) and (2) anywikidraw (action/anywikidraw.py) actions in MoinMoin before 1.9.6 allow remote authenticated users with write permissions to overwrite arbitrary files via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: this can be leveraged with CVE-2012-6081 to execute arbitrary code.

### CVSS Score: **6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
