- Published: 2012-09-20T21:55:00

- Modified: 2012-09-21T18:27:00

The Passcode Lock implementation in Apple iOS before 6 does not properly manage the lock state, which allows physically proximate attackers to bypass an intended passcode requirement via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
