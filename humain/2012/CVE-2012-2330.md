# CVE-2012-2330

- Published: 2012-08-13T23:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:33:00

The Update method in src/node_http_parser.cc in Node.js before 0.6.17 and 0.7 before 0.7.8 does not properly check the length of a string, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information (request header contents) and possibly spoof HTTP headers via a zero length string.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
