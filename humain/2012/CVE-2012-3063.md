Cisco Application Control Engine (ACE) before A4(2.3) and A5 before A5(1.1), when multicontext mode is enabled, does not properly share a management IP address among multiple contexts, which allows remote authenticated administrators to bypass intended access restrictions in opportunistic circumstances, and read or modify configuration settings, via a login attempt to a context, aka Bug ID CSCts30631, a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-3058.
