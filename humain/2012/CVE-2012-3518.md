- Published: 2012-08-26T03:17:00

- Modified: 2013-08-22T03:56:00

The networkstatus_parse_vote_from_string function in routerparse.c in Tor before 0.2.2.38 does not properly handle an invalid flavor name, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and daemon crash) via a crafted (1) vote document or (2) consensus document.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
