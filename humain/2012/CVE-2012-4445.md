Heap-based buffer overflow in the eap_server_tls_process_fragment function in eap_server_tls_common.c in the EAP authentication server in hostapd 0.6 through 1.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash or abort) via a small "TLS Message Length" value in an EAP-TLS message with the "More Fragments" flag set.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
