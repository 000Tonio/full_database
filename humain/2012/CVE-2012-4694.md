# CVE-2012-4694

- Published: 2013-02-15T12:09:00

- Modified: 2013-02-15T12:09:00

Moxa EDR-G903 series routers with firmware before 2.11 do not use a sufficient source of entropy for (1) SSH and (2) SSL keys, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof a device or modify a client-server data stream by leveraging knowledge of a key from a product installation elsewhere.

### CVSS Score: **7.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
