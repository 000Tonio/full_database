# CVE-2012-1122

- Published: 2012-06-29T19:55:00

- Modified: 2013-08-27T03:21:00

bug_actiongroup.php in MantisBT before 1.2.9 does not properly check the report_bug_threshold permission of the receiving project when moving a bug report, which allows remote authenticated users with the report_bug_threshold and move_bug_threshold privileges for a project to bypass intended access restrictions and move bug reports to a different project.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
