# CVE-2012-2123

- Published: 2012-05-17T11:00:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:24:00

The cap_bprm_set_creds function in security/commoncap.c in the Linux kernel before 3.3.3 does not properly handle the use of file system capabilities (aka fcaps) for implementing a privileged executable file, which allows local users to bypass intended personality restrictions via a crafted application, as demonstrated by an attack that uses a parent process to disable ASLR.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
