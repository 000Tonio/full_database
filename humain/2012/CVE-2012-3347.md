AutoFORM PDM Archive before 7.0 implements user accounts in a way that allows for JMX Console authentication, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions via the /jmx-console URI, and then upload and execute arbitrary JSP code via a JBoss remote-deployment mechanism, a different vulnerability than CVE-2012-1828.
