TCPIPS_Story.dll in Sielco Sistemi Winlog Pro SCADA before 2.07.18 and Winlog Lite SCADA before 2.07.18 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a port-46824 TCP packet with a crafted negative integer after the opcode, triggering incorrect function-pointer processing that can lead to a buffer overflow.  NOTE: some of these details are obtained from third party information.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2012-4354.
