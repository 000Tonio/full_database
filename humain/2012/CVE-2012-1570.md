# CVE-2012-1570

- Published: 2012-03-28T10:55:00

- Modified: 2020-08-14T17:11:00

The resolver in MaraDNS before 1.3.0.7.15 and 1.4.x before 1.4.12 overwrites cached server names and TTL values in NS records during the processing of a response to an A record query, which allows remote attackers to trigger continued resolvability of revoked domain names via a "ghost domain names" attack.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
