APT 0.7.x before 0.7.25 and 0.8.x before 0.8.16, when using the apt-key net-update to import keyrings, relies on GnuPG argument order and does not check GPG subkeys, which might allow remote attackers to install Trojan horse packages via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
