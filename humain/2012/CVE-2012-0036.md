curl and libcurl 7.2x before 7.24.0 do not properly consider special characters during extraction of a pathname from a URL, which allows remote attackers to conduct data-injection attacks via a crafted URL, as demonstrated by a CRLF injection attack on the (1) IMAP, (2) POP3, or (3) SMTP protocol.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
