Apache Hadoop before 0.23.4, 1.x before 1.0.4, and 2.x before 2.0.2 generate token passwords using a 20-bit secret when Kerberos security features are enabled, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to crack secret keys via a brute-force attack.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |
