The authentication functionality in EMC RSA Authentication Agent 7.1 and RSA Authentication Client 3.5 on Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, when an unspecified configuration exists, allows remote authenticated users to bypass an intended token-authentication step, and establish a login session to a remote host, by leveraging Windows credentials for that host.
