Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in fs-admin/fs-admin.php in the Mingle Forum plugin 1.0.32.1 and other versions before 1.0.33 for WordPress allow remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) delete_usrgrp[] parameter in a delete_usergroups action, (2) usergroup parameter in an add_user_togroup action, or (3) add_forum_group_id parameter in an add_forum_submit action.
