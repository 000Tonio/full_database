The Innominate mGuard Smart HW before HW-101130 and BD before BD-101030, mGuard industrial RS, mGuard delta HW before HW-103060 and BD before BD-211010, mGuard PCI, mGuard blade, and EAGLE mGuard appliances with software before 7.5.0 do not use a sufficient source of entropy for private keys, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof (1) HTTPS or (2) SSH servers by predicting a key value.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**
