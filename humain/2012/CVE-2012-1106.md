# CVE-2012-1106

- Published: 2012-07-03T16:40:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:31:00

The C handler plug-in in Automatic Bug Reporting Tool (ABRT), possibly 2.0.8 and earlier, does not properly set the group (GID) permissions on core dump files for setuid programs when the sysctl fs.suid_dumpable option is set to 2, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
