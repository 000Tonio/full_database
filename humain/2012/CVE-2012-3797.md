Pro-face WinGP PC Runtime 3.1.00 and earlier, and ProServr.exe in Pro-face Pro-Server EX 1.30.000 and earlier, does not properly check packet sizes before reusing packet memory buffers, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a short crafted packet with a certain opcode.
