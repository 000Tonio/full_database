- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:31:00

admin/Auth in OpenKM 5.1.7 and other versions before 5.1.8-2 does not properly enforce privileges for changing user roles, which allows remote authenticated users to assign administrator privileges to arbitrary users via the userEdit action.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
