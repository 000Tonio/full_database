# CVE-2012-2705

- Published: 2012-06-27T00:55:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:31:00

The filter_titles function in the Smart Breadcrumb module 6.x-1.x before 6.x-1.3 for Drupal does not properly convert a title to plain-text, which allows remote authenticated users with create or edit node permissions to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via the title parameter.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
