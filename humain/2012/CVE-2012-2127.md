# CVE-2012-2127

- Published: 2012-06-21T23:55:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:33:00

fs/proc/root.c in the procfs implementation in the Linux kernel before 3.2 does not properly interact with CLONE_NEWPID clone system calls, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (reference leak and memory consumption) by making many connections to a daemon that uses PID namespaces to isolate clients, as demonstrated by vsftpd.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
