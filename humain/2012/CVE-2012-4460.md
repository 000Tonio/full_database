# CVE-2012-4460

- Published: 2013-03-14T03:10:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T04:34:00

The serializing/deserializing functions in the qpid::framing::Buffer class in Apache Qpid 0.20 and earlier allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via unspecified vectors. NOTE: this issue could also trigger an out-of-bounds read, but it might not trigger a crash.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
