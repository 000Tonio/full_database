- Published: 2012-03-21T10:11:00

- Modified: 2017-08-29T01:31:00

The TAR file parser in Quick Heal (aka Cat QuickHeal) 11.00, Command Antivirus 5.2.11.5, F-Prot Antivirus 4.6.2.117, K7 AntiVirus 9.77.3565, Norman Antivirus 6.06.12, and Rising Antivirus 22.83.00.03 allows remote attackers to bypass malware detection via a POSIX TAR file with an initial \42\5A\68 character sequence.  NOTE: this may later be SPLIT into multiple CVEs if additional information is published showing that the error occurred independently in different TAR parser implementations.
