phpMyAdmin 3.5.2.2, as distributed by the cdnetworks-kr-1 mirror during an unspecified time frame in 2012, contains an externally introduced modification (Trojan Horse) in server_sync.php, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via an eval injection attack. Although not found in all distributions of this software, the vulnerability was scored assuming that it was. End-users will need to identify whether their distribution does in fact contain the vulnerability.
