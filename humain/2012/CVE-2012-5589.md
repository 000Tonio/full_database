# CVE-2012-5589

- Published: 2012-12-26T17:55:00

- Modified: 2012-12-27T05:00:00

The MultiLink module 6.x-2.x before 6.x-2.7 and 7.x-2.x before 7.x-2.7 for Drupal does not properly check node permissions when generating an in-content link, which allows remote authenticated users with text-editing permissions to read arbitrary node titles via a generated link.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
