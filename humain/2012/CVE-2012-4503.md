# CVE-2012-4503

- Published: 2013-11-05T21:55:00

- Modified: 2013-11-06T19:08:00

cmdmon.c in Chrony before 1.29 allows remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information from stack memory via vectors related to (1) an invalid subnet in a RPY_SUBNETS_ACCESSED command to the handle_subnets_accessed function or (2) a RPY_CLIENT_ACCESSES command to the handle_client_accesses function when client logging is disabled, which causes uninitialized data to be included in a reply.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
