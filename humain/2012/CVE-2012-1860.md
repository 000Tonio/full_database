Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 SP2 and SP3, SharePoint Server 2010 Gold and SP1, and Office Web Apps 2010 Gold and SP1 do not properly check permissions for search scopes, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service (data modification) by changing a parameter in a search-scope URL, aka "SharePoint Search Scope Vulnerability."

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | PARTIAL |
