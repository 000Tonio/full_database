mod/forum/unsubscribeall.php in Moodle 2.1.x before 2.1.7 and 2.2.x before 2.2.4 does not consider whether a forum is optional, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass forum-subscription requirements by leveraging the student role and unsubscribing from all forums.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
