The Limit Login Attempts plugin before 1.7.1 for WordPress does not clear auth cookies upon a lockout, which might make it easier for remote attackers to conduct brute-force authentication attempts.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
