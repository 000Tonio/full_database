- Published: 2012-11-16T00:55:00

- Modified: 2021-01-12T18:05:00

core/email_api.php in MantisBT before 1.2.12 does not properly manage the sending of e-mail notifications about restricted bugs, which might allow remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information by adding a note to a bug before losing permission to view that bug.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
