The getHiddenProperty function in bindings/core/v8/V8EventListenerList.h in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76, has a name conflict with the AudioContext class, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via JavaScript code that adds an AudioContext event listener and triggers "type confusion."
