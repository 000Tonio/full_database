OpenStack Neutron before 2014.2.4 (juno) and 2015.1.x before 2015.1.1 (kilo), when using the IPTables firewall driver, allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (L2 agent crash) by adding an address pair that is rejected by the ipset tool.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
