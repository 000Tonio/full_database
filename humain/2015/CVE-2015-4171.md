# CVE-2015-4171

- Published: 2015-06-10T18:59:00

- Modified: 2017-11-08T02:29:00

strongSwan 4.3.0 through 5.x before 5.3.2 and strongSwan VPN Client before 1.4.6, when using EAP or pre-shared keys for authenticating an IKEv2 connection, does not enforce server authentication restrictions until the entire authentication process is complete, which allows remote servers to obtain credentials by using a valid certificate and then reading the responses.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
