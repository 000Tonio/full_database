CSL DualCom GPRS CS2300-R devices with firmware 1.25 through 3.53 do not require authentication from Alarm Receiving Center (ARC) servers, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a spoofed HSxx response.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
