The Echo extension for MediWiki does not properly implement the hideuser functionality, which allows remote authenticated users to see hidden usernames in "non-revision based" notifications, as demonstrated by viewing a hidden username in a Thanks notification.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
