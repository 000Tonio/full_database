Mozilla Firefox before 38.0 does not recognize a referrer policy delivered by a referrer META element in cases of context-menu navigation and middle-click navigation, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by reading web-server Referer logs that contain private data in a URL, as demonstrated by a private path component.
