FortiOS 5.0.x before 5.0.12 and 5.2.x before 5.2.4 supports anonymous, export, RC4, and possibly other weak ciphers when using TLS to connect to FortiGuard servers, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof TLS content by modifying packets.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
