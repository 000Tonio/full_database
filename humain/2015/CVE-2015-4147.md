# CVE-2015-4147

- Published: 2015-06-09T18:59:00

- Modified: 2018-01-05T02:30:00

The SoapClient::__call method in ext/soap/soap.c in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 does not verify that __default_headers is an array, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by providing crafted serialized data with an unexpected data type, related to a "type confusion" issue.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
