# CVE-2015-5505

- Published: 2015-08-18T18:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-26T01:29:00

The HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) module 6.x-1.x before 6.x-1.1 and 7.x-1.x before 7.x-1.2 for Drupal does not properly implement the "include subdomains" directive, which causes the HSTS policy to not be applied to subdomains and allows man-in-the-middle attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
