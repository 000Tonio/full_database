# CVE-2015-8944

- Published: 2016-08-06T10:59:00

- Modified: 2016-11-28T19:50:00

The ioresources_init function in kernel/resource.c in the Linux kernel through 4.7, as used in Android before 2016-08-05 on Nexus 6 and 7 (2013) devices, uses weak permissions for /proc/iomem, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information by reading this file, aka Android internal bug 28814213 and Qualcomm internal bug CR786116. NOTE: the permissions may be intentional in most non-Android contexts.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
