# CVE-2015-8661

- Published: 2015-12-24T01:59:00

- Modified: 2018-12-21T11:29:00

The h264_slice_header_init function in libavcodec/h264_slice.c in FFmpeg before 2.8.3 does not validate the relationship between the number of threads and the number of slices, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted H.264 data.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
