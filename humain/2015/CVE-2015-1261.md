android/java/src/org/chromium/chrome/browser/WebsiteSettingsPopup.java in Google Chrome before 43.0.2357.65 on Android does not properly restrict use of a URL's fragment identifier during construction of a page-info popup, which allows remote attackers to spoof the URL bar or deliver misleading popup content via crafted text.
