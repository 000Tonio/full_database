The System Management Mode (SMM) implementation in Dell Latitude E6430 BIOS Revision A09, HP EliteBook 850 G1 BIOS revision L71 Ver. 01.09, and possibly other BIOS implementations does not ensure that function calls operate on SMRAM memory locations, which allows local users to bypass the Secure Boot protection mechanism and gain privileges by leveraging write access to physical memory.
