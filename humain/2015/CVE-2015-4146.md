# CVE-2015-4146

- Published: 2015-06-15T15:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

The EAP-pwd peer implementation in hostapd and wpa_supplicant 1.0 through 2.4 does not clear the L (Length) and M (More) flags before determining if a response should be fragmented, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a crafted message.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
