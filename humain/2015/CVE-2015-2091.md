- Published: 2015-03-13T14:59:00

- Modified: 2017-09-19T01:36:00

The authentication hook (mgs_hook_authz) in mod-gnutls 0.5.10 and earlier does not validate client certificates when "GnuTLSClientVerify require" is set, which allows remote attackers to spoof clients via a crafted certificate.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
