# CVE-2015-7830

- Published: 2015-11-15T03:59:00

The pcapng_read_if_descr_block function in wiretap/pcapng.c in the pcapng parser in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.8 uses too many levels of pointer indirection, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect free and application crash) via a crafted packet that triggers interface-filter copying.
