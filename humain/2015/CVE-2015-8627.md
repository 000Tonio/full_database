# CVE-2015-8627

- Published: 2017-03-23T20:59:00

MediaWiki before 1.23.12, 1.24.x before 1.24.5, 1.25.x before 1.25.4, and 1.26.x before 1.26.1 do not properly normalize IP addresses containing zero-padded octets, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by using an IP address that was not supposed to have been allowed.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
