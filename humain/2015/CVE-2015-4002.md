- Modified: 2022-11-03T02:03:00

drivers/staging/ozwpan/ozusbsvc1.c in the OZWPAN driver in the Linux kernel through 4.0.5 does not ensure that certain length values are sufficiently large, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash or large loop) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted packet, related to the (1) oz_usb_rx and (2) oz_usb_handle_ep_data functions.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | COMPLETE |
