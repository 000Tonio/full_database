The decompose function in platform/transforms/TransformationMatrix.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 45.0.2454.85, does not verify that a matrix inversion succeeded, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (uninitialized memory access and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted web site.
