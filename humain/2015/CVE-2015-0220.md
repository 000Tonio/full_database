- Published: 2015-01-16T16:59:00

- Modified: 2016-12-22T02:59:00

The django.util.http.is_safe_url function in Django before 1.4.18, 1.6.x before 1.6.10, and 1.7.x before 1.7.3 does not properly handle leading whitespaces, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a crafted URL, related to redirect URLs, as demonstrated by a "\njavascript:" URL.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
