The dissect_wccp2r1_address_table_info function in epan/dissectors/packet-wccp.c in the WCCP dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.6 does not properly determine whether enough memory is available for storing IP address strings, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via a crafted packet.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
