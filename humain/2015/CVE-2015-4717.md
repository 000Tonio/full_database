The filename sanitization component in ownCloud Server before 6.0.8, 7.0.x before 7.0.6, and 8.0.x before 8.0.4 does not properly handle $_GET parameters cast by PHP to an array, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop and log file consumption) via crafted endpoint file names.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
