The DebuggerFunction::InitAgentHost function in browser/extensions/api/debugger/debugger_api.cc in Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76 does not properly restrict what URLs are available as debugger targets, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a crafted extension.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| --- | --- | --- |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
