- Published: 2015-08-11T14:59:00

- Modified: 2016-12-24T02:59:00

The SSL-VPN feature in Fortinet FortiOS before 4.3.13 only checks the first byte of the TLS MAC in finished messages, which makes it easier for remote attackers to spoof encrypted content via a crafted MAC field.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
