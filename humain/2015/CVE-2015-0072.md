Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 through 11 allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy and inject arbitrary web script or HTML via vectors involving an IFRAME element that triggers a redirect, a second IFRAME element that does not trigger a redirect, and an eval of a WindowProxy object, aka "Universal XSS (UXSS)."

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
