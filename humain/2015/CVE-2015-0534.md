EMC RSA BSAFE Micro Edition Suite (MES) 4.0.x before 4.0.8 and 4.1.x before 4.1.3, RSA BSAFE Crypto-J before 6.2, RSA BSAFE SSL-J before 6.2, and RSA BSAFE SSL-C 2.8.9 and earlier do not enforce certain constraints on certificate data, which allows remote attackers to defeat a fingerprint-based certificate-blacklist protection mechanism by including crafted data within a certificate's unsigned portion, a similar issue to CVE-2014-8275.
