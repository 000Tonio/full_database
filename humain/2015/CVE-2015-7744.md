# CVE-2015-7744

- Published: 2016-01-22T15:59:00

- Modified: 2022-08-29T20:52:00

wolfSSL (formerly CyaSSL) before 3.6.8 does not properly handle faults associated with the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) process when allowing ephemeral key exchange without low memory optimizations on a server, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain private RSA keys by capturing TLS handshakes, aka a Lenstra attack.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
