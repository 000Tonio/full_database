The remote-support feature on Cisco Web Security Virtual Appliance (WSAv), Email Security Virtual Appliance (ESAv), and Security Management Virtual Appliance (SMAv) devices before 2015-06-25 uses the same default SSH host keys across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by leveraging knowledge of a private key from another installation, aka Bug IDs CSCus29681, CSCuu95676, and CSCuu96601.
