providers/saml2/admin.py in the Identity Provider (IdP) server in Ipsilon 0.1.0 before 1.0.1 does not properly check permissions to update the SAML2 Service Provider (SP) owner, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service via a duplicate SP name.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
