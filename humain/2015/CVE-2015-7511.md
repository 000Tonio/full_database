- Published: 2016-04-19T21:59:00

- Modified: 2017-07-01T01:29:00

Libgcrypt before 1.6.5 does not properly perform elliptic-point curve multiplication during decryption, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to extract ECDH keys by measuring electromagnetic emanations.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
