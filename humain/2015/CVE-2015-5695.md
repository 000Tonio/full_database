Designate 2015.1.0 through 1.0.0.0b1 as packaged in OpenStack Kilo does not enforce RecordSets per domain, and Records per RecordSet quotas when processing an internal zone file transfer, which might allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a crafted resource record set.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
