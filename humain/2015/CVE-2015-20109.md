# CVE-2015-20109

- Published: 2023-06-25T17:15:00

end_pattern (called from internal_fnmatch) in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.22 might allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash), as demonstrated by use of the fnmatch library function with the **(!() pattern. NOTE: this is not the same as CVE-2015-8984; also, some Linux distributions have fixed CVE-2015-8984 but have not fixed this additional fnmatch issue.
