- Published: 2016-02-22T05:59:00

- Modified: 2020-12-01T14:52:00

mod/forum/post.php in Moodle 2.9.x before 2.9.1 does not consider the mod/forum:canposttomygroups capability before authorizing "Post a copy to all groups" actions, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions by leveraging per-group authorization.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
