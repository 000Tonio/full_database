Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Shibboleth Authentication module before 6.x-4.1 and 7.x-4.x before 7.x-4.1 for Drupal allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that delete user role matching rules via unspecified vectors. Per the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2411737">advisory</a>:  "A malicious attacker can delete matching rules from the list by getting the administrator's browser to make a request to a specially-crafted URL while the administrator is logged in."  Only integrity and availability are affected

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
