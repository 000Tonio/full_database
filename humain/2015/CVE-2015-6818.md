# CVE-2015-6818

- Published: 2015-09-06T02:59:00

- Modified: 2018-12-21T11:29:00

The decode_ihdr_chunk function in libavcodec/pngdec.c in FFmpeg before 2.7.2 does not enforce uniqueness of the IHDR (aka image header) chunk in a PNG image, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted image with two or more of these chunks.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
