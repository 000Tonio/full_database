The virStorageVolCreateXML API in libvirt 1.2.14 through 1.2.19 allows remote authenticated users with a read-write connection to cause a denial of service (libvirtd crash) by triggering a failed unlink after creating a volume on a root_squash NFS pool.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
