# CVE-2015-1494

- Published: 2015-02-17T15:59:00

- Modified: 2021-09-13T10:46:00

The FancyBox for WordPress plugin before 3.0.3 for WordPress does not properly restrict access, which allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via an mfbfw[*] parameter in an update action to wp-admin/admin-post.php, as demonstrated by the mfbfw[padding] parameter and exploited in the wild in February 2015.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
