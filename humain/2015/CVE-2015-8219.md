The init_tile function in libavcodec/jpeg2000dec.c in FFmpeg before 2.8.2 does not enforce minimum-value and maximum-value constraints on tile coordinates, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JPEG 2000 data.
