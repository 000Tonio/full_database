# CVE-2015-8512

- Published: 2016-01-09T02:59:00

- Modified: 2016-01-14T15:28:00

The lockscreen feature in Mozilla Firefox OS before 2.5 does not properly restrict failed authentication attempts, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to obtain access by entering many passcode guesses.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
