- Published: 2015-06-22T19:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T01:29:00

cURL and libcurl 7.40.0 through 7.42.1 send the HTTP Basic authentication credentials for a previous connection when reusing a reset (curl_easy_reset) connection handle to send a request to the same host name, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
