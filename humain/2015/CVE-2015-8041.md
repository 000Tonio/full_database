# CVE-2015-8041

- Published: 2015-11-09T16:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

Multiple integer overflows in the NDEF record parser in hostapd before 2.5 and wpa_supplicant before 2.5 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process crash or infinite loop) via a large payload length field value in an (1) WPS or (2) P2P NFC NDEF record, which triggers an out-of-bounds read.

### CVSS Score: **5**
