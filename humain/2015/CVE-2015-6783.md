The FindStartOffsetOfFileInZipFile function in crazy_linker_zip.cpp in crazy_linker (aka Crazy Linker) in Android 5.x and 6.x, as used in Google Chrome before 47.0.2526.73, improperly searches for an EOCD record, which allows attackers to bypass a signature-validation requirement via a crafted ZIP archive.
