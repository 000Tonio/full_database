The Navigate module for Drupal does not properly check permissions, which allows remote authenticated users to modify custom widgets and create widget database records by leveraging the "navigate view" permission.

| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
