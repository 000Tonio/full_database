# CVE-2015-3416

- Published: 2015-04-24T17:59:00

- Modified: 2022-08-16T13:28:00

The sqlite3VXPrintf function in printf.c in SQLite before 3.8.9 does not properly handle precision and width values during floating-point conversions, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and stack-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via large integers in a crafted printf function call in a SELECT statement.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
