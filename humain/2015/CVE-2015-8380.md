# CVE-2015-8380

- Published: 2015-12-02T01:59:00

- Modified: 2017-07-01T01:29:00

The pcre_exec function in pcre_exec.c in PCRE before 8.38 mishandles a // pattern with a \01 string, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted regular expression, as demonstrated by a JavaScript RegExp object encountered by Konqueror.
