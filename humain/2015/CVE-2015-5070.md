# CVE-2015-5070

- Published: 2017-09-26T14:29:00

- Modified: 2017-10-10T14:54:00

The (1) filesystem::get_wml_location function in filesystem.cpp and (2) is_legal_file function in filesystem_boost.cpp in Battle for Wesnoth before 1.12.4 and 1.13.x before 1.13.1, when a case-insensitive filesystem is used, allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via vectors related to inclusion of .pbl files from WML.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-5069.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
