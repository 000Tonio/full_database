PCRE before 8.36 mishandles the /(((a\2)|(a*)\g<-1>))*/ pattern and related patterns with certain internal recursive back references, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted regular expression, as demonstrated by a JavaScript RegExp object encountered by Konqueror.
