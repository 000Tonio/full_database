Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in Revive Adserver before 3.2.2 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of users for requests that (1) perform certain plugin actions and possibly cause a denial of service (disabled core plugins) via unknown vectors or (2) change the contact name and language or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted POST request to an account-user-*.php script.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
