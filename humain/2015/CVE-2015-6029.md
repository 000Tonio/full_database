- Published: 2015-11-04T03:59:00

HP ArcSight Logger before 6.0 P2 does not limit attempts to authenticate to the SOAP interface, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access via a brute-force approach.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
