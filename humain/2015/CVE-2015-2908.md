** DISPUTED ** Mobile Devices (aka MDI) C4 OBD-II dongles with firmware 2.x and 3.4.x, as used in Metromile Pulse and other products, do not validate firmware updates, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by specifying an update server.  NOTE: the vendor states "This was a flaw for the developer/debugging devices, and was fixed in production version about 3 years ago."
