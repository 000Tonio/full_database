- Published: 2015-08-26T19:59:00

- Modified: 2015-08-27T14:00:00

The invokeNextValve function in identity/federation/bindings/tomcat/idp/AbstractIDPValve.java in PicketLink before 2.8.0.Beta1 does not properly check role based authorization, which allows remote authenticated users to gain access to restricted application resources via a (1) direct request or (2) request through an SP initiated flow.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
