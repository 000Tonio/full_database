The VideoWhisper videowhisper-video-conference-integration plugin 4.91.8 for WordPress allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because vc/vw_upload.php considers a file safe when "html" are the last four characters, as demonstrated by a .phtml file containing PHP code, a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-1905.
