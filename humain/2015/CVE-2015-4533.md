EMC Documentum Content Server before 6.7SP1 P32, 6.7SP2 before P25, 7.0 before P19, 7.1 before P16, and 7.2 before P02 does not properly check authorization after creation of an object, which allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary code with super-user privileges via a custom script.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-2513.
