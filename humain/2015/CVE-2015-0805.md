The Off Main Thread Compositing (OMTC) implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 37.0 makes an incorrect memset call during interaction with the mozilla::layers::BufferTextureClient::AllocateForSurface function, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (memory corruption and application crash) via vectors that trigger rendering of 2D graphics content.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
