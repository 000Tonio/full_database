The dissect_rsvp_common function in epan/dissectors/packet-rsvp.c in the RSVP dissector in Wireshark 1.12.x before 1.12.9 and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 does not properly maintain request-key data, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and application crash) via a crafted packet.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
