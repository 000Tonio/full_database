Off-by-one error in the OBJ_obj2txt function in LibreSSL before 2.3.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (program crash) or possible execute arbitrary code via a crafted X.509 certificate, which triggers a stack-based buffer overflow. Note: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2014-3508.
