- Published: 2015-08-22T18:59:00

- Modified: 2016-12-24T02:59:00

Lockbox in EMC Documentum D2 before 4.5 uses a hardcoded passphrase when a server lacks a D2.Lockbox file, which makes it easier for remote authenticated users to decrypt admin tickets by locating this passphrase in a decompiled D2 JAR archive.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
