SChannel in Microsoft Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2, and Windows RT Gold and 8.1 lacks the required extended master-secret binding support to ensure that a server's X.509 certificate is the same during renegotiation as it was before renegotiation, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to obtain sensitive information or modify TLS session data via a "triple handshake attack," aka "Schannel TLS Triple Handshake Vulnerability."
