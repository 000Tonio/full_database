- Modified: 2015-12-28T21:43:00

The Frontel protocol before 3 on RSI Video Technologies Videofied devices does not use integrity protection, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to (1) initiate a false alarm or (2) deactivate an alarm by modifying the client-server data stream.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
