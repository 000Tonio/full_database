# CVE-2015-9232

- Published: 2017-09-20T22:29:00

- Modified: 2017-10-04T20:19:00

The Good for Enterprise application 3.0.0.415 for Android does not use signature protection for its Authentication Delegation API intent. Also, the Good Dynamic application activation process does not attempt to detect malicious activation attempts involving modified names beginning with a com.good.gdgma substring. Consequently, an attacker could obtain access to intranet data. This issue is only relevant in cases where the user has already downloaded a malicious Android application.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
