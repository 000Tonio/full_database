# CVE-2015-3335

- Published: 2015-04-19T10:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

The NaClSandbox::InitializeLayerTwoSandbox function in components/nacl/loader/sandbox_linux/nacl_sandbox_linux.cc in Google Chrome before 42.0.2311.90 does not have RLIMIT_AS and RLIMIT_DATA limits for Native Client (aka NaCl) processes, which might make it easier for remote attackers to conduct row-hammer attacks or have unspecified other impact by leveraging the ability to run a crafted program in the NaCl sandbox.
