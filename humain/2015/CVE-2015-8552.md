The PCI backend driver in Xen, when running on an x86 system and using Linux 3.1.x through 4.3.x as the driver domain, allows local guest administrators to generate a continuous stream of WARN messages and cause a denial of service (disk consumption) by leveraging a system with access to a passed-through MSI or MSI-X capable physical PCI device and XEN_PCI_OP_enable_msi operations, aka "Linux pciback missing sanity checks."

### CVSS Score: **1.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
