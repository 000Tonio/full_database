# CVE-2015-2756

- Published: 2015-04-01T14:59:00

QEMU, as used in Xen 3.3.x through 4.5.x, does not properly restrict access to PCI command registers, which might allow local HVM guest users to cause a denial of service (non-maskable interrupt and host crash) by disabling the (1) memory or (2) I/O decoding for a PCI Express device and then accessing the device, which triggers an Unsupported Request (UR) response.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
