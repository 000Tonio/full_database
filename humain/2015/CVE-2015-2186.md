The Ansible edxapp role in the Configuration Repo in edX allows remote websites to spoof edX accounts by leveraging use of the string literal "False" instead of a boolean False for the CORS_ORIGIN_ALLOW_ALL setting. Note: this vulnerability was fixed on 2015-03-06, but the version number was not changed.
