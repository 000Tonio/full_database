# CVE-2015-4036

- Published: 2015-08-31T20:59:00

- Modified: 2016-12-22T02:59:00

Array index error in the tcm_vhost_make_tpg function in drivers/vhost/scsi.c in the Linux kernel before 4.0 might allow guest OS users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT ioctl call.  NOTE: the affected function was renamed to vhost_scsi_make_tpg before the vulnerability was announced.
