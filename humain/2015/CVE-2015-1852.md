# CVE-2015-1852

- Published: 2015-04-17T17:59:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:47:00

The s3_token middleware in OpenStack keystonemiddleware before 1.6.0 and python-keystoneclient before 1.4.0 disables certification verification when the "insecure" option is set in a paste configuration (paste.ini) file regardless of the value, which allows remote attackers to conduct man-in-the-middle attacks via a crafted certificate, a different vulnerability than CVE-2014-7144.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
