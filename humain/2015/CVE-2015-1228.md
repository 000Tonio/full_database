# CVE-2015-1228

The RenderCounter::updateCounter function in core/rendering/RenderCounter.cpp in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76, does not force a relayout operation and consequently does not initialize memory for a data structure, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) token sequence.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
