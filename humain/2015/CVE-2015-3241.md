- Published: 2015-09-08T15:59:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T00:48:00

OpenStack Compute (nova) 2015.1 through 2015.1.1, 2014.2.3, and earlier does not stop the migration process when the instance is deleted, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (disk, network, and other resource consumption) by resizing and then deleting an instance.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
