# CVE-2015-1350

- Published: 2016-05-02T10:59:00

- Modified: 2020-08-03T15:02:00

The VFS subsystem in the Linux kernel 3.x provides an incomplete set of requirements for setattr operations that underspecifies removing extended privilege attributes, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (capability stripping) via a failed invocation of a system call, as demonstrated by using chown to remove a capability from the ping or Wireshark dumpcap program.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
