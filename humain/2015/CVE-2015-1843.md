# CVE-2015-1843

- Published: 2015-04-06T15:59:00

- Modified: 2016-07-26T01:59:00

The Red Hat docker package before 1.5.0-28, when using the --add-registry option, falls back to HTTP when the HTTPS connection to the registry fails, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to conduct downgrade attacks and obtain authentication and image data by leveraging a network position between the client and the registry to block HTTPS traffic.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of a CVE-2014-5277 regression.
