The V8ThrowException::createDOMException function in bindings/core/v8/V8ThrowException.cpp in the V8 bindings in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 40.0.2214.111 on Windows, OS X, and Linux and before 40.0.2214.109 on Android, does not properly consider frame access restrictions during the throwing of an exception, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via a crafted web site.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
