The Management Console in Red Hat Enterprise Application Platform before 6.4.4 and WildFly (formerly JBoss Application Server) does not send an X-Frame-Options HTTP header, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct clickjacking attacks via a crafted web page that contains a (1) FRAME or (2) IFRAME element.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
