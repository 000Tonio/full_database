The MWOAuthDataStore::lookup_token function in Extension:OAuth for MediaWiki 1.25.x before 1.25.3, 1.24.x before 1.24.4, and before 1.23.11 does not properly validate the signature when checking the authorization signature, which allows remote registered Consumers to use another Consumer's credentials by leveraging knowledge of the credentials.

### CVSS Score: **5**
