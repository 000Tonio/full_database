# CVE-2015-8607

- Published: 2016-01-13T15:59:00

- Modified: 2020-07-15T03:15:00

The canonpath function in the File::Spec module in PathTools before 3.62, as used in Perl, does not properly preserve the taint attribute of data, which might allow context-dependent attackers to bypass the taint protection mechanism via a crafted string.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |
