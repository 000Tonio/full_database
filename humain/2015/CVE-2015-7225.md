Tinfoil Devise-two-factor before 2.0.0 does not strictly follow section 5.2 of RFC 6238 and does not "burn" a successfully validated one-time password (aka OTP), which allows remote or physically proximate attackers with a target user's login credentials to log in as said user by obtaining the OTP through performing a man-in-the-middle attack between the provider and verifier, or shoulder surfing, and replaying the OTP in the current time-step.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
