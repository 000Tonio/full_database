vzctl before 4.9.4 determines the virtual environment (VE) layout based on the presence of root.hdd/DiskDescriptor.xml in the VE private directory, which allows local simfs container (CT) root users to change the root password for arbitrary ploop containers, as demonstrated by a symlink attack on the ploop container root.hdd file and then access a control panel.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
