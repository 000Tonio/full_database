Blue Coat ProxyClient before 3.3.3.3 and 3.4.x before 3.4.4.10 and Unified Agent before 4.1.3.151952 does not properly validate certain certificates, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof ProxySG Client Managers, and consequently modify configurations and execute arbitrary software updates, via a crafted certificate.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
