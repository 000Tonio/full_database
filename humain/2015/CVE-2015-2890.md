The BIOS implementation on Dell Latitude, OptiPlex, Precision Mobile Workstation, and Precision Workstation Client Solutions (CS) devices with model-dependent firmware before A21 does not enforce a BIOS_CNTL locking protection mechanism upon being woken from sleep, which allows local users to conduct EFI flash attacks by leveraging console access, a similar issue to CVE-2015-3692.
