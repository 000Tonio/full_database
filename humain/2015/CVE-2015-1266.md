content/browser/webui/content_web_ui_controller_factory.cc in Google Chrome before 43.0.2357.130 does not properly consider the scheme in determining whether a URL is associated with a WebUI SiteInstance, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a similar URL, as demonstrated by use of http://gpu when there is a WebUI class for handling chrome://gpu requests.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
