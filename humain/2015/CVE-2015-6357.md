# CVE-2015-6357

- Published: 2015-11-18T11:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-09T19:57:00

The rule-update feature in Cisco FireSIGHT Management Center (MC) 5.2 through 5.4.0.1 does not verify the X.509 certificate of the support.sourcefire.com SSL server, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof this server and provide an invalid package, and consequently execute arbitrary code, via a crafted certificate, aka Bug ID CSCuw06444.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
