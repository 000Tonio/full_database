# CVE-2015-4490

- Published: 2015-08-16T01:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

The nsCSPHostSrc::permits function in dom/security/nsCSPUtils.cpp in Mozilla Firefox before 40.0 does not implement the Content Security Policy Level 2 exceptions for the blob, data, and filesystem URL schemes during wildcard source-expression matching, which might make it easier for remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by leveraging unexpected policy-enforcement behavior.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
