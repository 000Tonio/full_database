Untrusted search path vulnerability in the client in Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) through 8.1 in Microsoft Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 allows local users to gain privileges via a Trojan horse DLL in the current working directory, as demonstrated by a directory that contains a .rdp file, aka "Remote Desktop Protocol DLL Planting Remote Code Execution Vulnerability." <a href="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/426.html">CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path</a>

Per the Microsoft advisory, " In a web-based attack scenario an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted RDP file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force the user to visit the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince the user to click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message."
