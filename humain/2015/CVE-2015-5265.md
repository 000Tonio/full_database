- Published: 2016-02-22T05:59:00

The wiki component in Moodle through 2.6.11, 2.7.x before 2.7.10, 2.8.x before 2.8.8, and 2.9.x before 2.9.2 does not consider the mod/wiki:managefiles capability before authorizing file management, which allows remote authenticated users to delete arbitrary files by using a manage-files button in a text editor.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
