# CVE-2015-3144

- Published: 2015-04-24T14:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-17T01:29:00

The fix_hostname function in cURL and libcurl 7.37.0 through 7.41.0 does not properly calculate an index, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read or write and crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact via a zero-length host name, as demonstrated by "http://:80" and ":80." The previous CVSS assessment 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/AU:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) was provided at the time of initial analysis based on the best available published information at that time.  The score has been updated to reflect the impact to Oracle products per <a href=http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpuoct2015-2367953.html> Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2015 </a>. Other products listed as vulnerable may or may not be similarly impacted.

Also Per <a href=http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpuoct2015-2367953.html> Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2015 </a> -
This fix also addresses CVE-2014-3707, CVE-2014-8150, CVE-2015-3153 and CVE-2015-3236. The CVSS score is 9.0 if MySQL Enterprise Monitor runs with admin or root privileges. The score would be 6.5 if MySQL Enterprise Monitor runs with non-admin privileges and the impact on Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability would be Partial+. The Sub-Component for version 3.0.x is 'Proxy/Aggregator'.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
