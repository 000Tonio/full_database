# CVE-2015-3224

- Published: 2015-07-26T22:59:00

- Modified: 2016-12-03T03:08:00

request.rb in Web Console before 2.1.3, as used with Ruby on Rails 3.x and 4.x, does not properly restrict the use of X-Forwarded-For headers in determining a client's IP address, which allows remote attackers to bypass the whitelisted_ips protection mechanism via a crafted request.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
