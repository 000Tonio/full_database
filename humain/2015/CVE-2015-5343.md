# CVE-2015-5343

- Published: 2016-04-14T14:59:00

- Modified: 2019-02-12T20:07:00

Integer overflow in util.c in mod_dav_svn in Apache Subversion 1.7.x, 1.8.x before 1.8.15, and 1.9.x before 1.9.3 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (subversion server crash or memory consumption) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a skel-encoded request body, which triggers an out-of-bounds read and heap-based buffer overflow.

### CVSS Score: **8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | COMPLETE |
