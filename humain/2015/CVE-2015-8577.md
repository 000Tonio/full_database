The Buffer Overflow Protection (BOP) feature in McAfee VirusScan Enterprise before 8.8 Patch 6 allocates memory with Read, Write, Execute (RWX) permissions at predictable addresses on 32-bit platforms when protecting another application, which allows attackers to bypass the DEP and ASLR protection mechanisms via unspecified vectors.
