# CVE-2015-8382

- Published: 2015-12-02T01:59:00

- Modified: 2016-12-28T02:59:00

The match function in pcre_exec.c in PCRE before 8.37 mishandles the /(?:((abcd))|(((?:(?:(?:(?:abc|(?:abcdef))))b)abcdefghi)abc)|((*ACCEPT)))/ pattern and related patterns involving (*ACCEPT), which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory or cause a denial of service (partially initialized memory and application crash) via a crafted regular expression, as demonstrated by a JavaScript RegExp object encountered by Konqueror, aka ZDI-CAN-2547.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
