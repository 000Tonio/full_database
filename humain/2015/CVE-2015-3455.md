Squid 3.2.x before 3.2.14, 3.3.x before 3.3.14, 3.4.x before 3.4.13, and 3.5.x before 3.5.4, when configured with client-first SSL-bump, do not properly validate the domain or hostname fields of X.509 certificates, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof SSL servers via a valid certificate.
