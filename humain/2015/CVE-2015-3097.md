# CVE-2015-3097

- Published: 2015-06-10T01:59:00

Adobe Flash Player before 13.0.0.292 and 14.x through 18.x before 18.0.0.160, Adobe AIR before 18.0.0.144, Adobe AIR SDK before 18.0.0.144, and Adobe AIR SDK & Compiler before 18.0.0.144 on 64-bit Windows 7 systems do not properly select a random memory address for the Flash heap, which makes it easier for attackers to conduct unspecified attacks by predicting this address.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
