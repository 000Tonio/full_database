Mozilla Firefox before 41.0 does not properly restrict the availability of High Resolution Time API times, which allows remote attackers to track last-level cache access, and consequently obtain sensitive information, via crafted JavaScript code that makes performance.now calls.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
