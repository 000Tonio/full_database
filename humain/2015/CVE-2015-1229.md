net/http/proxy_client_socket.cc in Google Chrome before 41.0.2272.76 does not properly handle a 407 (aka Proxy Authentication Required) HTTP status code accompanied by a Set-Cookie header, which allows remote proxy servers to conduct cookie-injection attacks via a crafted response.

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
