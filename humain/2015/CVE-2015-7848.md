An integer overflow can occur in NTP-dev.4.3.70 leading to an out-of-bounds memory copy operation when processing a specially crafted private mode packet. The crafted packet needs to have the correct message authentication code and a valid timestamp. When processed by the NTP daemon, it leads to an immediate crash.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
