Certain input passed into the If-Modified-Since or Last-Modified headers will cause an 'illegal access' exception to be raised. Instead of sending a HTTP 500 error back to the sender, hapi node module before 11.1.3 will continue to hold the socket open until timed out (default node timeout is 2 minutes).
