# CVE-2015-4051

- Published: 2015-06-08T14:59:00

- Modified: 2016-12-31T02:59:00

Beckhoff IPC Diagnostics before 1.8 does not properly restrict access to functions in /config, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (reboot or shutdown), create arbitrary users, or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted request, as demonstrated by a beckhoff.com:service:cxconfig:1#Write SOAP action to /upnpisapi.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
