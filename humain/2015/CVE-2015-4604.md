# CVE-2015-4604

- Published: 2016-05-16T10:59:00

- Modified: 2019-04-22T17:48:00

The mget function in softmagic.c in file 5.x, as used in the Fileinfo component in PHP before 5.4.40, 5.5.x before 5.5.24, and 5.6.x before 5.6.8, does not properly maintain a certain pointer relationship, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted string that is mishandled by a "Python script text executable" rule.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
