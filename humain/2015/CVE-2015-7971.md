Xen 3.2.x through 4.6.x does not limit the number of printk console messages when logging certain pmu and profiling hypercalls, which allows local guests to cause a denial of service via a sequence of crafted (1) HYPERCALL_xenoprof_op hypercalls, which are not properly handled in the do_xenoprof_op function in common/xenoprof.c, or (2) HYPERVISOR_xenpmu_op hypercalls, which are not properly handled in the do_xenpmu_op function in arch/x86/cpu/vpmu.c.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
