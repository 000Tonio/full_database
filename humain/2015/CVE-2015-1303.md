bindings/core/v8/V8DOMWrapper.h in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 45.0.2454.101, does not perform a rethrow action to propagate information about a cross-context exception, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via a crafted HTML document containing an IFRAME element.
