Dedicated Micros DV-IP Express, SD Advanced, SD, EcoSense, and DS2 devices rely on a GUI warning to help ensure that the administrator configures login credentials, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain access by leveraging situations in which this warning was not heeded. NOTE: the vendor states "The user is presented with clear warnings on the GUI that they should set usernames and passwords."
