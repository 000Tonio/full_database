The kernel in Microsoft Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2, Windows RT Gold and 8.1, and Windows 10 allows physically proximate attackers to bypass the Trusted Boot protection mechanism, and consequently interfere with the integrity of code, BitLocker, Device Encryption, and Device Health Attestation, via a crafted Boot Configuration Data (BCD) setting, aka "Trusted Boot Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability."
