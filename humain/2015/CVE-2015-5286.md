OpenStack Image Service (Glance) before 2014.2.4 (juno) and 2015.1.x before 2015.1.2 (kilo) allows remote authenticated users to bypass the storage quota and cause a denial of service (disk consumption) by deleting images that are being uploaded using a token that expires during the process. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-9623.
