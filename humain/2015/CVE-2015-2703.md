Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Websense TRITON AP-WEB before 8.0.0 and V-Series 7.7 appliances allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) ws-userip in the ws-encdata parameter to cve-bin/moreBlockInfo.cgi in the Data Security block page or (2) admin_msg parameter to configure/ssl_ui/eva-config/client-cert-import_wsoem.html in the Content Gateway, which is not properly handled in an error message.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
