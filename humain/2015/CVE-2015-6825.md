The ff_frame_thread_init function in libavcodec/pthread_frame.c in FFmpeg before 2.7.2 mishandles certain memory-allocation failures, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid pointer access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted file, as demonstrated by an AVI file.
