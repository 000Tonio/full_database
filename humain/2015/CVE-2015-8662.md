The ff_dwt_decode function in libavcodec/jpeg2000dwt.c in FFmpeg before 2.8.4 does not validate the number of decomposition levels before proceeding with Discrete Wavelet Transform decoding, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted JPEG 2000 data.
