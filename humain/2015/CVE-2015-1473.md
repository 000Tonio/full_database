# CVE-2015-1473

- Published: 2015-04-08T10:59:00

- Modified: 2016-11-28T19:18:00

The ADDW macro in stdio-common/vfscanf.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.21 does not properly consider data-type size during a risk-management decision for use of the alloca function, which might allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation violation) or overwrite memory locations beyond the stack boundary via a long line containing wide characters that are improperly handled in a wscanf call.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
