SQL injection vulnerability in counter-options.php in the Count Per Day plugin before 3.4.1 for WordPress allows remote authenticated administrators to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the cpd_keep_month parameter to wp-admin/options-general.php.  NOTE: this can be leveraged using CSRF to allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
