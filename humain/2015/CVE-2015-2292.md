Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in admin/class-bulk-editor-list-table.php in the WordPress SEO by Yoast plugin before 1.5.7, 1.6.x before 1.6.4, and 1.7.x before 1.7.4 for WordPress allow remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) order_by or (2) order parameter in the wpseo_bulk-editor page to wp-admin/admin.php.  NOTE: this can be leveraged using CSRF to allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
