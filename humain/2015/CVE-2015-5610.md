The RSM (aka RSMWinService) service in SolarWinds N-Able N-Central before 9.5.1.4514 uses the same password decryption key across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for remote authenticated users to obtain the cleartext domain-administrator password by locating the encrypted password within HTML source code and then leveraging knowledge of this key from another installation.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
