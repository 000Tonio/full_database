# CVE-2015-2266

- Published: 2015-06-01T19:59:00

- Modified: 2020-12-01T14:54:00

message/index.php in Moodle through 2.5.9, 2.6.x before 2.6.9, 2.7.x before 2.7.6, and 2.8.x before 2.8.4 does not consider the moodle/site:readallmessages capability before accessing arbitrary conversations, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive personal-contact and unread-message-count information via a modified URL.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
