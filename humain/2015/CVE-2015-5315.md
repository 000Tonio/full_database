# CVE-2015-5315

- Published: 2018-02-21T16:29:00

- Modified: 2018-03-21T13:06:00

The eap_pwd_process function in eap_peer/eap_pwd.c in wpa_supplicant 2.x before 2.6 does not validate that the reassembly buffer is large enough for the final fragment when EAP-pwd is enabled in a network configuration profile, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process termination) via a large final fragment in an EAP-pwd message.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
