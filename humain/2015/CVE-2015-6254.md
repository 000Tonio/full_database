- Published: 2015-08-17T20:59:00

- Modified: 2015-08-19T22:54:00

The (1) Service Provider (SP) and (2) Identity Provider (IdP) in PicketLink before 2.7.0 does not ensure that the Destination attribute in a Response element in a SAML assertion matches the location from which the message was received, which allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors.  NOTE: this identifier was SPLIT from CVE-2015-0277 per ADT2 due to different vulnerability types.
