The eshop_checkout function in checkout.php in the Wordpress Eshop plugin 6.3.11 and earlier does not validate variables in the "eshopcart" HTTP cookie, which allows remote attackers to perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or a path disclosure attack via crafted variables named after target PHP variables.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
