The Form API in Drupal 6.x before 6.37 and 7.x before 7.39 does not properly validate the form token, which allows remote attackers to conduct CSRF attacks that upload files in a different user's account via vectors related to "file upload value callbacks."

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
