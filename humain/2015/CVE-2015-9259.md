# CVE-2015-9259

- Published: 2018-03-31T21:29:00

In Docker Notary before 0.1, the checkRoot function in gotuf/client/client.go does not check expiry of root.json files, despite a comment stating that it does. Even if a user creates a new root.json file after a key compromise, an attacker can produce update files referring to an old root.json file.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
