The Network Location Awareness (NLA) service in Microsoft Windows Server 2003 SP2, Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, and Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2 does not perform mutual authentication to determine a domain connection, which allows remote attackers to trigger an unintended permissive configuration by spoofing DNS and LDAP responses on a local network, aka "NLA Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability."

### CVSS Score: **6.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |
