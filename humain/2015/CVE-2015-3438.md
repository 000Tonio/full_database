Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in WordPress before 4.1.2, when MySQL is used without strict mode, allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a (1) four-byte UTF-8 character or (2) invalid character that reaches the database layer, as demonstrated by a crafted character in a comment.
