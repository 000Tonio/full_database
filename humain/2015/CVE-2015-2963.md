# CVE-2015-2963

- Published: 2015-07-10T17:59:00

- Modified: 2016-12-03T03:07:00

The thoughtbot paperclip gem before 4.2.2 for Ruby does not consider the content-type value during media-type validation, which allows remote attackers to upload HTML documents and conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via a spoofed value, as demonstrated by image/jpeg.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
