Asterisk Open Source 12.x before 12.8.1 and 13.x before 13.1.1, when using the PJSIP channel driver, does not properly reclaim RTP ports, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (file descriptor consumption) via an SDP offer containing only incompatible codecs.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
