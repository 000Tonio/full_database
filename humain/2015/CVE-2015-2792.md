# CVE-2015-2792

- Published: 2015-03-30T14:59:00

The WPML plugin before 3.1.9 for WordPress does not properly handle multiple actions in a request, which allows remote attackers to bypass nonce checks and perform arbitrary actions via a request containing an action POST parameter, an action GET parameter, and a valid nonce for the action GET parameter.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
