The extractFrom function in Internals/QuotedString.cpp in Arduino JSON before 4.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) via a JSON string with a \ (backslash) followed by a terminator, as demonstrated by "\\\0", which triggers a buffer overflow and over-read.

### CVSS Score: **5**
