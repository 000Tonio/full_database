Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the Alfresco module before 6.x-1.3 for Drupal allows remote attackers to hijack the authentication of arbitrary users for requests that delete an alfresco node via unspecified vectors. Per the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2411523">advisory</a>:  "A malicious user could cause a user to delete alfresco nodes by getting the user's browser to make a request to a specially-crafted URL while the user was logged in."  Only integrity and availability are affected.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
