# CVE-2015-2741

- Published: 2015-07-06T02:01:00

Mozilla Firefox before 39.0, Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.1, and Thunderbird before 38.1 do not enforce key pinning upon encountering an X.509 certificate problem that generates a user dialog, which allows user-assisted man-in-the-middle attackers to bypass intended access restrictions by triggering a (1) expired certificate or (2) mismatched hostname for a domain with pinning enabled.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
