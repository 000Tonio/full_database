- Published: 2015-07-14T16:59:00

The escape_command function in include/Administration/corePerformance/getStats.php in Centreon (formerly Merethis Centreon) 2.5.4 and earlier (fixed in Centreon 19.10.0) uses an incorrect regular expression, which allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in the ns_id parameter.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
