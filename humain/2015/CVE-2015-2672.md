# CVE-2015-2672

- Published: 2016-05-02T10:59:00

- Modified: 2016-05-06T16:46:00

The xsave/xrstor implementation in arch/x86/include/asm/xsave.h in the Linux kernel before 3.19.2 creates certain .altinstr_replacement pointers and consequently does not provide any protection against instruction faulting, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) by triggering a fault, as demonstrated by an unaligned memory operand or a non-canonical address memory operand.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
