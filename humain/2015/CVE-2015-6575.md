# CVE-2015-6575

- Published: 2015-10-01T00:59:00

- Modified: 2015-10-01T18:10:00

SampleTable.cpp in libstagefright in Android before 5.1.1 LMY48I does not properly consider integer promotion, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (integer overflow and memory corruption) via crafted atoms in MP4 data, aka internal bug 20139950, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-1538. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-7915, CVE-2014-7916, and/or CVE-2014-7917.
