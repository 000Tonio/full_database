The Sandbox feature in xnu in Apple iOS before 9.2, OS X before 10.11.2, tvOS before 9.1, and watchOS before 2.1 does not properly implement privilege separation, which allows attackers to bypass the ASLR protection mechanism via a crafted app with root privileges.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
