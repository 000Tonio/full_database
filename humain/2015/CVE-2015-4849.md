Unspecified vulnerability in the Oracle Payments component in Oracle E-Business Suite 11.5.10.2, 12.0.6, 12.1.3, 12.2.3, and 12.2.4 allows remote attackers to affect confidentiality, integrity, and availability via unknown vectors related to Punch-in. NOTE: the previous information is from the October 2015 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that this issue is an XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or conduct SMB Relay attacks via a crafted DTD in an XML request to OA_HTML/IspPunchInServlet.
