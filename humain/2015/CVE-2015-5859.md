The CFNetwork HTTPProtocol component in Apple iOS before 9 and OS X before 10.11 does not properly recognize the HSTS preload list during a Safari private-browsing session, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by sniffing the network.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
