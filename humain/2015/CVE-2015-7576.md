The http_basic_authenticate_with method in actionpack/lib/action_controller/metal/http_authentication.rb in the Basic Authentication implementation in Action Controller in Ruby on Rails before 3.2.22.1, 4.0.x and 4.1.x before 4.1.14.1, 4.2.x before 4.2.5.1, and 5.x before 5.0.0.beta1.1 does not use a constant-time algorithm for verifying credentials, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass authentication by measuring timing differences.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
