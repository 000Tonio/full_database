Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the Node basket module for Drupal allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of arbitrary users for requests that (1) add or (2) remove nodes from a basket via unspecified vectors. Per the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/node/2424419">advisory</a>:  "A malicious user can cause another user to add/remove nodes of the basket by getting his browser to make a request to a specially-crafted URL."  Only integrity and availability are affected.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
