The ff_hevc_parse_sps function in libavcodec/hevc_ps.c in FFmpeg before 2.8.2 does not validate the Chroma Format Indicator, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) data.
