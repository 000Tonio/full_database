# CVE-2015-1108

- Published: 2015-04-10T14:59:00

- Modified: 2017-01-03T02:59:00

The Lock Screen component in Apple iOS before 8.3 does not properly enforce the limit on incorrect passcode-authentication attempts, which makes it easier for physically proximate attackers to obtain access by making many passcode guesses.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
