# CVE-2015-8983

- Published: 2017-03-20T16:59:00

- Modified: 2017-03-22T19:12:00

Integer overflow in the _IO_wstr_overflow function in libio/wstrops.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.22 allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors related to computing a size in bytes, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
