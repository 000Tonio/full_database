Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Serendipity before 2.0.3 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the serendipity[entry_id] parameter in an "edit" admin action to serendipity_admin.php. Per http://blog.s9y.org/archives/266-Serendipity-2.0.3-released.html:
"The issue only affects logged-in authors, where HTML can be inserted into the comment editing form when they click specially crafted links.Due to the required authentication we consider the issue of medium impact, but suggest everyone to perform the update."

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
