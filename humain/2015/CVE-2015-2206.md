# CVE-2015-2206

- Published: 2015-03-09T17:59:00

- Modified: 2016-12-28T02:59:00

libraries/select_lang.lib.php in phpMyAdmin 4.0.x before 4.0.10.9, 4.2.x before 4.2.13.2, and 4.3.x before 4.3.11.1 includes invalid language values in unknown-language error responses that contain a CSRF token and may be sent with HTTP compression, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct a BREACH attack and determine this token via a series of crafted requests.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
