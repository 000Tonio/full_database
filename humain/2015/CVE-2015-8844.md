- Modified: 2018-01-05T02:30:00

The signal implementation in the Linux kernel before 4.3.5 on powerpc platforms does not check for an MSR with both the S and T bits set, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (TM Bad Thing exception and panic) via a crafted application.

### CVSS Score: **4.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
