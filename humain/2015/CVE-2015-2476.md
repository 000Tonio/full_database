The WebDAV client in Microsoft Windows Vista SP2, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and R2 SP1, Windows 7 SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2012 Gold and R2, and Windows RT Gold and 8.1 supports SSL 2.0, which makes it easier for remote attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by sniffing the network and conducting a decryption attack, aka "WebDAV Client Information Disclosure Vulnerability."
