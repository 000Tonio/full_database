# CVE-2015-2698

- Published: 2015-11-13T03:59:00

- Modified: 2020-01-21T15:47:00

The iakerb_gss_export_sec_context function in lib/gssapi/krb5/iakerb.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.14 pre-release 2015-09-14 improperly accesses a certain pointer, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by interacting with an application that calls the gss_export_sec_context function.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2015-2696.
