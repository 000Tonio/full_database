The default configuration of the server in MobaXterm before 8.3 has a disabled Access Control setting and consequently does not require authentication for X11 connections, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands or obtain sensitive information via X11 packets.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |
