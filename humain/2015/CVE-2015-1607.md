# CVE-2015-1607

- Published: 2019-11-20T19:15:00

- Modified: 2019-11-22T16:19:00

kbx/keybox-search.c in GnuPG before 1.4.19, 2.0.x before 2.0.27, and 2.1.x before 2.1.2 does not properly handle bitwise left-shifts, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid read operation) via a crafted keyring file, related to sign extensions and "memcpy with overlapping ranges."

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
