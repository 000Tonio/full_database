platform/graphics/filters/FEColorMatrix.cpp in the SVG implementation in Blink, as used in Google Chrome before 43.0.2357.65, does not properly handle an insufficient number of values in an feColorMatrix filter, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (container overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted document.
