Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the Image Metadata Cruncher plugin for WordPress allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via the (1) image_metadata_cruncher[alt] or (2) image_metadata_cruncher[caption] parameter in an update action in the image_metadata_cruncher_title page to wp-admin/options.php or (3) custom image meta tag to the image metadata cruncher page.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
