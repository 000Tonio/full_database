# CVE-2015-6855

- Published: 2015-11-06T21:59:00

- Modified: 2021-12-15T17:05:00

hw/ide/core.c in QEMU does not properly restrict the commands accepted by an ATAPI device, which allows guest users to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via certain IDE commands, as demonstrated by a WIN_READ_NATIVE_MAX command to an empty drive, which triggers a divide-by-zero error and instance crash.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
