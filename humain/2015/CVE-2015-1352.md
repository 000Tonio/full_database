The build_tablename function in pgsql.c in the PostgreSQL (aka pgsql) extension in PHP through 5.6.7 does not validate token extraction for table names, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and application crash) via a crafted name.

### CVSS Score: **5**
