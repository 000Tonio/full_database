# CVE-2015-8618

- Published: 2016-01-27T20:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

The Int.Exp Montgomery code in the math/big library in Go 1.5.x before 1.5.3 mishandles carry propagation and produces incorrect output, which makes it easier for attackers to obtain private RSA keys via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
