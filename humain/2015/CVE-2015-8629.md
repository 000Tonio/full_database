# CVE-2015-8629

- Published: 2016-02-13T02:59:00

- Modified: 2021-02-02T19:24:00

The xdr_nullstring function in lib/kadm5/kadm_rpc_xdr.c in kadmind in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.13.4 and 1.14.x before 1.14.1 does not verify whether '\0' characters exist as expected, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via a crafted string.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
