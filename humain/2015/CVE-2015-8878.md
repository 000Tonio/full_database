main/php_open_temporary_file.c in PHP before 5.5.28 and 5.6.x before 5.6.12 does not ensure thread safety, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (race condition and heap memory corruption) by leveraging an application that performs many temporary-file accesses.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
