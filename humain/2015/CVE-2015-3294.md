# CVE-2015-3294

- Published: 2015-05-08T14:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-09T19:56:00

The tcp_request function in Dnsmasq before 2.73rc4 does not properly handle the return value of the setup_reply function, which allows remote attackers to read process memory and cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and crash) via a malformed DNS request.

### CVSS Score: **6.4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | PARTIAL |
