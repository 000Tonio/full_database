OpenStack Compute (nova) before 2014.2.4 (juno) and 2015.1.x before 2015.1.2 (kilo) does not properly delete instances from compute nodes, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (disk consumption) by deleting instances while in the resize state.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
