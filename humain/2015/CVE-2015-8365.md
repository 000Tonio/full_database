# CVE-2015-8365

- Published: 2015-11-26T17:59:00

- Modified: 2017-11-04T01:29:00

The smka_decode_frame function in libavcodec/smacker.c in FFmpeg before 2.6.5, 2.7.x before 2.7.3, and 2.8.x through 2.8.2 does not verify that the data size is consistent with the number of channels, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds array access) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted Smacker data.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
