# CVE-2015-8805

- Published: 2016-02-23T19:59:00

- Modified: 2018-10-30T16:27:00

The ecc_256_modq function in ecc-256.c in Nettle before 3.2 does not properly handle carry propagation and produces incorrect output in its implementation of the P-256 NIST elliptic curve, which allows attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-8803.
