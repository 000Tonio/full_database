- Modified: 2016-12-22T03:00:00

The NSURL implementation in the CFNetwork SSL component in Apple iOS before 9 does not properly verify X.509 certificates from SSL servers after a certificate change, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate.
