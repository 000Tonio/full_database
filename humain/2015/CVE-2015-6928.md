classes/admin.class.php in CubeCart 5.2.12 through 5.2.16 and 6.x before 6.0.7 does not properly validate that a password reset request was made, which allows remote attackers to change the administrator password via a recovery request with a space character in the validate parameter and the administrator email in the email parameter.
