Basware Banking (Maksuliikenne) before 8.90.07.X relies on the client to enforce (1) login verification, (2) audit trail creation, and (3) account locking, which allows remote attackers to "disrupt security-critical functions" by "dropping network traffic." NOTE: this identifier was SPLIT from CVE-2015-0942 per ADT2 and ADT3 due to different vulnerability type and different affected versions.
