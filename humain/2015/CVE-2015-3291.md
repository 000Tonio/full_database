# CVE-2015-3291

- Published: 2015-08-31T10:59:00

- Modified: 2016-12-22T02:59:00

arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S in the Linux kernel before 4.1.6 on the x86_64 platform does not properly determine when nested NMI processing is occurring, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (skipped NMI) by modifying the rsp register, issuing a syscall instruction, and triggering an NMI.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
