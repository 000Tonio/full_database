Cisco Secure Access Control System before 5.4(0.46.2) and 5.5 before 5.5(0.46) and Cisco Identity Services Engine 1.0(4.573) do not properly implement access control for support bundles, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information via brute-force attempts to send valid credentials, aka Bug IDs CSCue00833 and CSCub40331.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
