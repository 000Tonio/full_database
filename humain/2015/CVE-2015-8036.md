# CVE-2015-8036

- Published: 2015-11-02T19:59:00

- Modified: 2019-06-19T13:59:00

Heap-based buffer overflow in ARM mbed TLS (formerly PolarSSL) 1.3.x before 1.3.14 and 2.x before 2.1.2 allows remote SSL servers to cause a denial of service (client crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long session ticket name to the session ticket extension, which is not properly handled when creating a ClientHello message to resume a session.  NOTE: this identifier was SPLIT from CVE-2015-5291 per ADT3 due to different affected version ranges.
