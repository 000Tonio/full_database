# CVE-2015-5739

- Published: 2017-10-18T20:29:00

- Modified: 2019-05-10T16:45:00

The net/http library in net/textproto/reader.go in Go before 1.4.3 does not properly parse HTTP header keys, which allows remote attackers to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks via a space instead of a hyphen, as demonstrated by "Content Length" instead of "Content-Length."
