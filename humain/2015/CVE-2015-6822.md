The destroy_buffers function in libavcodec/sanm.c in FFmpeg before 2.7.2 does not properly maintain height and width values in the video context, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation violation and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted LucasArts Smush video data.
