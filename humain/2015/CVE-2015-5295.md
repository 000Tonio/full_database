The template-validate command in OpenStack Orchestration API (Heat) before 2015.1.3 (kilo) and 5.0.x before 5.0.1 (liberty) allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) or determine the existence of local files via the resource type in a template, as demonstrated by file:///dev/zero.
