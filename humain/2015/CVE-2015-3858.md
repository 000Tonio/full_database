The checkDestination function in internal/telephony/SMSDispatcher.java in Android before 5.1.1 LMY48M relies on an obsolete permission name for an authorization check, which allows attackers to bypass an intended user-confirmation requirement for SMS short-code messaging via a crafted application, aka internal bug 22314646.
