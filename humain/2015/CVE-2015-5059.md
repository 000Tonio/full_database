The "Project Documentation" feature in MantisBT 1.2.19 and earlier, when the threshold to access files ($g_view_proj_doc_threshold) is set to ANYBODY, allows remote authenticated users to download attachments linked to arbitrary private projects via a file id number in the file_id parameter to file_download.php.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
