In Garden versions 0.22.0-0.329.0, a vulnerability has been discovered in the garden-linux nstar executable that allows access to files on the host system. By staging an application on Cloud Foundry using Diego and Garden installations with a malicious custom buildpack an end user could read files on the host system that the BOSH-created vcap user has permissions to read and then package them into their app droplet.
