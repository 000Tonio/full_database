The mp2t_open function in wiretap/mp2t.c in the MP2T file parser in Wireshark 2.0.x before 2.0.1 does not validate the bit rate, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and application crash) via a crafted file.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
