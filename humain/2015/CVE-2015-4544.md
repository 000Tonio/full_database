EMC Documentum Content Server before 7.1P20 and 7.2.x before 7.2P04 does not properly verify authorization for dm_job object access, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain superuser privileges via crafted object operations.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-4626.
