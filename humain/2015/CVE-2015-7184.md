The fetch API implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 41.0.2 does not restrict access to the HTTP response body in certain situations where user credentials are supplied but the CORS cross-origin request algorithm is improperly followed, which allows remote attackers to bypass the Same Origin Policy via a crafted web site.
