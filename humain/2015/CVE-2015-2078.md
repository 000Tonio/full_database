The SDK for Komodia Redirector with SSL Digestor, as used in Lavasoft Ad-Aware Web Companion 1.1.885.1766 and Ad-Aware AdBlocker (alpha) 1.3.69.1, Qustodio for Windows, Atom Security, Inc. StaffCop 5.8, and other products, does not properly verify X.509 certificates from SSL servers, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-2077.
