Node.js 0.12.x before 0.12.9, 4.x before 4.2.3, and 5.x before 5.1.1 does not ensure the availability of a parser for each HTTP socket, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (uncaughtException and service outage) via a pipelined HTTP request.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
