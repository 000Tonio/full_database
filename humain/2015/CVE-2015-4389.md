# CVE-2015-4389

- Published: 2015-06-15T14:59:00

- Modified: 2016-06-09T21:29:00

The Open Graph Importer (og_tag_importer) 7.x-1.x for Drupal does not properly check the create permission for content types created during import, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended restrictions by leveraging the "import og_tag_importer" permission.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
