The update_dimensions function in libavcodec/vp8.c in FFmpeg through 2.8.1, as used in Google Chrome before 46.0.2490.71 and other products, relies on a coefficient-partition count during multi-threaded operation, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (race condition and memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted WebM file.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |
