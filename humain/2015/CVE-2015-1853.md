chrony before 1.31.1 does not properly protect state variables in authenticated symmetric NTP associations, which allows remote attackers with knowledge of NTP peering to cause a denial of service (inability to synchronize) via random timestamps in crafted NTP data packets.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
