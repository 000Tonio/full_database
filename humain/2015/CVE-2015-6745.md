Basware Banking (Maksuliikenne) 8.90.07.X relies on the client to enforce account locking, which allows local users to bypass that security mechanism by deleting the entry from the locking table.  NOTE: this identifier was SPLIT from CVE-2015-0942 per ADT2 and ADT3 due to different vulnerability type and different affected versions.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2015-6744.
