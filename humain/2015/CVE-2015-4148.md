# CVE-2015-4148

- Published: 2015-06-09T18:59:00

The do_soap_call function in ext/soap/soap.c in PHP before 5.4.39, 5.5.x before 5.5.23, and 5.6.x before 5.6.7 does not verify that the uri property is a string, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by providing crafted serialized data with an int data type, related to a "type confusion" issue.

### CVSS Score: **5**
