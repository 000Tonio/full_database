The checkPassword function in python-kerberos does not authenticate the KDC it attempts to communicate with, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (bad response), or have other unspecified impact by performing a man-in-the-middle attack.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
