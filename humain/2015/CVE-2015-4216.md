# CVE-2015-4216

- Published: 2015-06-26T10:59:00

The remote-support feature on Cisco Web Security Virtual Appliance (WSAv), Email Security Virtual Appliance (ESAv), and Security Management Virtual Appliance (SMAv) devices before 2015-06-25 uses the same default SSH root authorized key across different customers' installations, which makes it easier for remote attackers to bypass authentication by leveraging knowledge of a private key from another installation, aka Bug IDs CSCuu95988, CSCuu95994, and CSCuu96630.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
