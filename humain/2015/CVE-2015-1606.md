- Published: 2019-11-20T19:15:00

- Modified: 2019-11-22T16:33:00

The keyring DB in GnuPG before 2.1.2 does not properly handle invalid packets, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid read and use-after-free) via a crafted keyring file.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
