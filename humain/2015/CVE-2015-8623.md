# CVE-2015-8623

- Published: 2017-03-23T20:59:00

The User::matchEditToken function in includes/User.php in MediaWiki before 1.23.12 and 1.24.x before 1.24.5 does not perform token comparison in constant time before returning, which allows remote attackers to guess the edit token and bypass CSRF protection via a timing attack, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-8624.
