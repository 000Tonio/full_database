# CVE-2015-7665

- Published: 2015-12-27T19:59:00

- Modified: 2016-11-28T19:44:00

Tails before 1.7 includes the wget program but does not prevent automatic fallback from passive FTP to active FTP, which allows remote FTP servers to discover the Tor client IP address by reading a (1) PORT or (2) EPRT command.  NOTE: within wget itself, the automatic fallback is not considered a vulnerability by CVE.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
