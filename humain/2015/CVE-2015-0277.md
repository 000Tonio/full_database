- Published: 2015-08-17T20:59:00

The Service Provider (SP) in PicketLink before 2.7.0 does not ensure that it is a member of an Audience element when an AudienceRestriction is specified, which allows remote attackers to log in to other users' accounts via a crafted SAML assertion. NOTE: this identifier has been SPLIT per ADT2 due to different vulnerability types. See CVE-2015-6254 for lack of validation for the Destination attribute in a Response element in a SAML assertion.
