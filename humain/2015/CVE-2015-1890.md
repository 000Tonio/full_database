/usr/lpp/mmfs/bin/gpfs.snap in IBM General Parallel File System (GPFS) 4.1 before 4.1.0.7 produces an archive potentially containing cleartext keys, and lacks a warning about reviewing this archive to detect included keys, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging access to a technical-support data stream.
