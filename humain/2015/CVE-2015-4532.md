- Published: 2015-08-20T10:59:00

EMC Documentum Content Server before 6.7SP1 P32, 6.7SP2 before P25, 7.0 before P19, 7.1 before P16, and 7.2 before P02 does not properly check authorization and does not properly restrict object types, which allows remote authenticated users to run save RPC commands with super-user privileges, and consequently execute arbitrary code, via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2014-2514.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
