# CVE-2015-5593

- Published: 2019-12-31T21:15:00

- Modified: 2020-01-07T19:30:00

The sanitize_string function in Zenphoto before 1.4.9 does not properly sanitize HTML tags, which allows remote attackers to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack by wrapping a payload in "<<script></script>script>payload<script></script></script>", or in an image tag, with the payload as the onerror event.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
