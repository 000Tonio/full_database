# CVE-2015-2694

- Published: 2015-05-25T19:59:00

- Modified: 2020-01-21T15:46:00

The kdcpreauth modules in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) 1.12.x and 1.13.x before 1.13.2 do not properly track whether a client's request has been validated, which allows remote attackers to bypass an intended preauthentication requirement by providing (1) zero bytes of data or (2) an arbitrary realm name, related to plugins/preauth/otp/main.c and plugins/preauth/pkinit/pkinit_srv.c.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | NONE |
