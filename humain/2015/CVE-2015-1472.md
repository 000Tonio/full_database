# CVE-2015-1472

- Published: 2015-04-08T10:59:00

- Modified: 2019-06-13T21:29:00

The ADDW macro in stdio-common/vfscanf.c in the GNU C Library (aka glibc or libc6) before 2.21 does not properly consider data-type size during memory allocation, which allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a long line containing wide characters that are improperly handled in a wscanf call.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
