After logging into the portal, the logout jsp page redirects the browser back to the login page after. It is feasible for malicious users to redirect the browser to an unintended web page in Apache jUDDI 3.1.2, 3.1.3, 3.1.4, and 3.1.5 when utilizing the portlets based user interface also known as 'Pluto', 'jUDDI Portal', 'UDDI Portal' or 'uddi-console'. User session data, credentials, and auth tokens are cleared before the redirect.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**
