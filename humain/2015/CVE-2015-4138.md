The WebUI component in Blue Coat SSL Visibility Appliance SV800, SV1800, SV2800, and SV3800 3.6.x through 3.8.x before 3.8.4 does not include the HTTPOnly flag in a Set-Cookie header for the administrator's cookie, which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain potentially sensitive information via script access to this cookie, a different vulnerability than CVE-2015-2855.
