- Published: 2015-07-06T02:01:00

- Modified: 2016-12-28T02:59:00

The AudioParamTimeline::AudioNodeInputValue function in the Web Audio implementation in Mozilla Firefox before 39.0 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.1 does not properly calculate an oscillator rendering range, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory or cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read) via unspecified vectors.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
