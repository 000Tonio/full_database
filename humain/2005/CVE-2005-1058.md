Cisco IOS 12.2T, 12.3 and 12.3T, when processing an ISAKMP profile that specifies XAUTH authentication after Phase 1 negotiation, may not process certain attributes in the ISAKMP profile that specifies XAUTH, which allows remote attackers to bypass XAUTH and move to Phase 2 negotiations.

| --- | --- | --- |
