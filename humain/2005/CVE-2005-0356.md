# CVE-2005-0356

- Published: 2005-05-31T04:00:00

- Modified: 2019-04-30T14:27:00

Multiple TCP implementations with Protection Against Wrapped Sequence Numbers (PAWS) with the timestamps option enabled allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (connection loss) via a spoofed packet with a large timer value, which causes the host to discard later packets because they appear to be too old.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
