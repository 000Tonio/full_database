Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in modules.php in PHP-Nuke 7.8, when magic_quotes_gpc is disabled, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) name, (2) sid, and (3) pid parameters in a POST request, which bypasses security checks that are performed for GET requests.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
