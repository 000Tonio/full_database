** DISPUTED ** Note: the vendor has disputed this issue. Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Land Down Under (LDU) 800 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) c or (2) m parameters to index.php or (3) w parameter to journal.php.  NOTE: this issue has been disputed by the vendor, who says "None of the tricks written there are working, the variables are properly sanitized and no LDU version is affected."

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
