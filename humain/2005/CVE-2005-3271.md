# CVE-2005-3271

- Published: 2005-10-21T01:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-03T21:31:00

Exec in Linux kernel 2.6 does not properly clear posix-timers in multi-threaded environments, which results in a resource leak and could allow a large number of multiple local users to cause a denial of service by using more posix-timers than specified by the quota for a single user.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
