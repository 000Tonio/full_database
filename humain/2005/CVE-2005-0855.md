CoolForum 0.8.1 beta and earlier allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive path information via direct requests to (1) entete.php, (2) profile_accueil.php, (3) profile_mdp.php, (4) profile_notify.php, (5) profile_options.php, (6) profile_perso.php, (7) profile_pm.php, or (8) readannonce.php, which leaks the full pathname in a PHP error message.
