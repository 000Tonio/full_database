- Published: 2005-08-12T04:00:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T01:16:00

The find_target function in ptrace32.c in the Linux kernel 2.4.x before 2.4.29 does not properly handle a NULL return value from another function, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel crash/oops) by running a 32-bit ltrace program with the -i option on a 64-bit executable program.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
