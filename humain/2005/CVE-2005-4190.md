Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Horde Application Framework before 3.0.8 allow remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via multiple vectors, as demonstrated by (1) the identity field, (2) Category and (3) Label search fields, (4) the Mobile Phone field, and (5) Date and (6) Time fields when importing CSV files, as exploited through modules such as (a) Turba Address Book, (b) Kronolith, (c) Mnemo, and (d) Nag.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
