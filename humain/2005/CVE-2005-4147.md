- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:40:00

The TCLHTTPd service in Lyris ListManager before 8.9b allows remote attackers to obtain source code for arbitrary .tml (TCL) files via (1) a request with a trailing null byte (%00), which might also require (2) an authentication bypass step that involves a username with a trailing "@" characters.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
