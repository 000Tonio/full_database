# CVE-2005-4449

- Published: 2005-12-21T11:03:00

- Modified: 2017-07-20T01:29:00

verify.php in FlatNuke 2.5.6 allows remote authenticated administrators to modify arbitrary PHP files by setting the file parameter to an arbitrary file and injecting the code into the body parameter.  NOTE: if a FlatNuke administrator is normally assumed to be able to modify arbitrary content, then this issue does not cross privilege boundaries and would not be a vulnerability.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
