# CVE-2005-2099

- Published: 2005-08-23T04:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:32:00

The Linux kernel before 2.6.12.5 does not properly destroy a keyring that is not instantiated properly, which allows local users or remote attackers to cause a denial of service (kernel oops) via a keyring with a payload that is not empty, which causes the creation to fail, leading to a null dereference in the keyring destructor.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
