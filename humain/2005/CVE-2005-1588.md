** DISPUTED **  SQL injection vulnerability in index.php for Quick.cart 0.3.0 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the iCategory parameter.  NOTE: the vendor has privately disputed this issue, saying that Quick.cart does not even use SQL and therefore can not be vulnerable to SQL injection.
