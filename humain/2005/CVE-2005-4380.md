Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Bitweaver 1.1 and 1.1.1 beta allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) sort_mode parameter to (a) fisheye/list_galleries.php, (b) messages/message_box.php, and (c) users/my.php; the (2) post_id parameter to (d) blogs/view_post.php; and the (3) blog_id parameter to (e) blogs/view.php, which are not properly cleansed by the convert_sortmode function in kernel/BitDb.php.
