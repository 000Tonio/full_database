# CVE-2005-3054

- Published: 2005-09-26T19:03:00

- Modified: 2018-10-03T21:31:00

fopen_wrappers.c in PHP 4.4.0, and possibly other versions, does not properly restrict access to other directories when the open_basedir directive includes a trailing slash, which allows PHP scripts in one directory to access files in other directories whose names are substrings of the original directory.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
