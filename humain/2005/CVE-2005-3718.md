UTStarcom F1000 VOIP WIFI Phone s2.0 running VxWorks 5.5.1 with kernel WIND 2.6 does not allow users to disable access to (1) SNMP or (2) the rlogin port TCP 513, which allows remote attackers to exploit other vulnerabilities such as CVE-2005-3716, or execute arbitrary shell commands via rlogin, which does not require authentication.
