- Published: 2005-09-30T10:05:00

- Modified: 2018-08-13T21:47:00

The mprotect code (mprotect.c) in Linux 2.6 on Itanium IA64 Montecito processors does not properly maintain cache coherency as required by the architecture, which allows local users to cause a denial of service and possibly corrupt data by modifying PTE protections.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
