WorldClient webmail in Alt-N MDaemon 8.1.3 allows remote attackers to prevent arbitrary users from accessing their inboxes via script tags in the Subject header of an e-mail message, which prevents the user from being able to access the Inbox folder, possibly due to a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
