# CVE-2005-2876

- Published: 2005-09-13T23:03:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:34:00

umount in util-linux 2.8 to 2.12q, 2.13-pre1, and 2.13-pre2, and other packages such as loop-aes-utils, allows local users with unmount permissions to gain privileges via the -r (remount) option, which causes the file system to be remounted with just the read-only flag, which effectively clears the nosuid, nodev, and other flags.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |
