The login protocol in RealChat 3.5.1b does not use authentication, which allows remote attackers to log on as other users by sniffing the beginning of a chat session and replaying it via a modified username.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
