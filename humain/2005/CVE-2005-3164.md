# CVE-2005-3164

- Published: 2005-10-06T10:02:00

- Modified: 2022-02-03T19:39:00

The AJP connector in Apache Tomcat 4.0.1 through 4.0.6 and 4.1.0 through 4.1.36, as used in Hitachi Cosminexus Application Server and standalone, does not properly handle when a connection is broken before request body data is sent in a POST request, which can lead to an information leak when "unsuitable request body data" is used for a different request, possibly related to Java Servlet pages.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
