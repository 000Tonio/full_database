Stack-based buffer overflows in the (1) xmlvarcharfromfile, (2) xmlclobfromfile, (3) xmlfilefromvarchar, and (4) xmlfilefromclob function calls in IBM DB2 8.1 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a 94-byte second argument, which causes the return address to be overwritten with a pointer to the argument.
