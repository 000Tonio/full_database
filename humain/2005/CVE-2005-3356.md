# CVE-2005-3356

- Published: 2005-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:15:00

The mq_open system call in Linux kernel 2.6.9, in certain situations, can decrement a counter twice ("double decrement") as a result of multiple calls to the mntput function when the dentry_open function call fails, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) via unspecified attack vectors.
