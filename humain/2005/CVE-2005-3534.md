# CVE-2005-3534

- Published: 2005-12-22T21:03:00

- Modified: 2018-10-03T21:32:00

Buffer overflow in the Network Block Device (nbd) server 2.7.5 and earlier, and 2.8.0 through 2.8.2, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a large request, which is written past the end of the buffer because nbd does not account for memory taken by the reply header.
