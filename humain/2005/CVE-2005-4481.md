** DISPUTED **  Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Polopoly 9 and earlier allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified search parameters. NOTE: the vendor has disputed this vulnerability, stating that the "XSS flaw was only part of the custom implementation of the [polopoly] site".  As of 20061003, CVE has no further information on this issue, except that the original researcher has a history of testing live sites and assuming that discoveries indicate vulnerabilities in the associated package.
