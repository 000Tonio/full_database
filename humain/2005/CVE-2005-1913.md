The Linux kernel 2.6 before 2.6.12.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel panic) via a non group-leader thread executing a different program than was pending in itimer, which causes the signal to be delivered to the old group-leader task, which does not exist.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
