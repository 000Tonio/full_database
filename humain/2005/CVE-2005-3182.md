Buffer overflow in the HTTP management interface for GFI MailSecurity 8.1 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via long headers such as (1) Host and (2) Accept in HTTP requests.  NOTE: the vendor suggests that this issues is "in an underlying Microsoft technology" which, if true, could mean that the overflow affects other products as well.
