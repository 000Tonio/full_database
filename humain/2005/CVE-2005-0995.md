Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in ProductCart 2.7 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the keyword parameter to advSearch_h.asp, (2) the redirectUrl parameter to NewCust.asp, (3) the country parameter to storelocator_submit.asp, or (4) the error parameter to techErr.asp. NOTE: it has been reported that storelocator_submit.asp does not exist in ProductCart.
