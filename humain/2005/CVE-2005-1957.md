mtnpeak.net File Upload Manager does not properly check user authentication for certain actions, which allows remote attackers to provide a modified base64-encoded file parameter and (1) read arbitrary files via the "view" action or (2) delete arbitrary files via the del action.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
