# CVE-2005-2532

- Published: 2005-08-24T04:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T20:52:00

OpenVPN before 2.0.1 does not properly flush the OpenSSL error queue when a packet can not be decrypted by the server, which allows remote authenticated attackers to cause a denial of service (client disconnection) via a large number of packets that can not be decrypted.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
