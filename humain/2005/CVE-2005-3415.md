# CVE-2005-3415

- Published: 2005-11-01T21:02:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:33:00

phpBB 2.0.17 and earlier allows remote attackers to bypass protection mechanisms that deregister global variables by setting both a GET/POST/COOKIE (GPC) variable and a GLOBALS[] variable with the same name, which causes phpBB to unset the GLOBALS[] variable but not the GPC variable.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| --- | --- | --- |
