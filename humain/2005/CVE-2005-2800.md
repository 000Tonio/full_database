# CVE-2005-2800

- Published: 2005-09-06T17:03:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:33:00

Memory leak in the seq_file implementation in the SCSI procfs interface (sg.c) in Linux kernel 2.6.13 and earlier allows local users to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via certain repeated reads from the /proc/scsi/sg/devices file, which is not properly handled when the next() iterator returns NULL or an error.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
