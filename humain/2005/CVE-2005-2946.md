# CVE-2005-2946

- Published: 2005-09-16T22:03:00

- Modified: 2009-01-07T05:00:00

The default configuration on OpenSSL before 0.9.8 uses MD5 for creating message digests instead of a more cryptographically strong algorithm, which makes it easier for remote attackers to forge certificates with a valid certificate authority signature.

### CVSS Score: **5**
