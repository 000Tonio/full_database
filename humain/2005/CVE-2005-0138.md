# CVE-2005-0138

- Published: 2005-09-21T20:03:00

- Modified: 2016-05-09T15:32:00

rpc.mountd in SGI IRIX 6.5.25, 6.5.26, and 6.5.27 does not correctly allow access to anonymous clients that connect from a system whose hostname can not be determined.  NOTE: while this issue occurs in a security mechanism, there is no apparent attacker role and probably does not satisfy the CVE definition of a vulnerability.
