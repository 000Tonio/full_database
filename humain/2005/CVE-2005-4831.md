# CVE-2005-4831

- Published: 2005-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:41:00

viewcvs in ViewCVS 0.9.2 allows remote attackers to set the Content-Type header to arbitrary values via the content-type parameter, which can be leveraged for cross-site scripting (XSS) and other attacks, as demonstrated using (1) "text/html", or (2) "image/jpeg" with an image that is rendered as HTML by Internet Explorer, a different vulnerability than CVE-2004-1062.  NOTE: it was later reported that 0.9.4 is also affected.
