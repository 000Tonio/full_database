The (1) clcs and (2) emuxki drivers in NetBSD 1.6 through 2.0.2 allow local users to cause a denial of service (kernel crash) by using the set-parameters ioctl on an audio device to change the block size and set the pause state to "unpaused" in the same ioctl, which causes a divide-by-zero error.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
