The CGIwrap program before 3.9 on Debian GNU/Linux uses an incorrect minimum value of 100 for a UID to determine whether it can perform a seteuid operation, which could allow attackers to execute code as other system UIDs that are greater than the minimum value, which should be 1000 on Debian systems.
