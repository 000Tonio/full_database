# CVE-2005-1344

- Published: 2005-05-02T04:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-10T19:38:00

Buffer overflow in htdigest in Apache 2.0.52 may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via a long realm argument.  NOTE: since htdigest is normally only locally accessible and not setuid or setgid, there are few attack vectors which would lead to an escalation of privileges, unless htdigest is executed from a CGI program.  Therefore this may not be a vulnerability.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
