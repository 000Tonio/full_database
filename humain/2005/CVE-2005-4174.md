- Published: 2005-12-11T21:03:00

eFiction 1.0, 1.1, and 2.0, in unspecified environments, might allow remote attackers to conduct unauthorized operations by directly accessing (1) install.php or (2) upgrade.php.  NOTE: it is unclear whether this is a vulnerability in eFiction itself or the result of incorrect system administration practices, e.g. by not removing utility scripts once they have been used.
