NLSCCSTR.DLL in the web service in IBM Lotus Domino Server 6.5.1, 6.0.3, and possibly other versions allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (deep recursion and nHTTP.exe process crash) via a long GET request containing UNICODE decimal value 430 characters, which causes the stack to be exhausted.  NOTE: IBM has reported that it is unable to replicate this issue.
