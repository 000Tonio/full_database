# CVE-2005-2335

- Published: 2005-07-27T04:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:32:00

Buffer overflow in the POP3 client in Fetchmail before 6.2.5.2 allows remote POP3 servers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via long UIDL responses.  NOTE: a typo in an advisory accidentally used the wrong CVE identifier for the Fetchmail issue. This is the correct identifier.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
