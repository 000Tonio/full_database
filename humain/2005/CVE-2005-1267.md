# CVE-2005-1267

- Published: 2005-06-10T04:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:31:00

The bgp_update_print function in tcpdump 3.x does not properly handle a -1 return value from the decode_prefix4 function, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) via a crafted BGP packet.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
