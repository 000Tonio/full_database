Bugzilla 2.17.x, 2.18 before 2.18.2, 2.19.x, and 2.20 before 2.20rc1 inserts a bug into the database before it is marked private, which introduces a race condition and allows attackers to access information about the bug via buglist.cgi before MySQL replication is complete.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
