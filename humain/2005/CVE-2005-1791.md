# CVE-2005-1791

- Published: 2005-05-28T04:00:00

Microsoft Internet Explorer 6 SP2 (6.0.2900.2180) crashes when the user attempts to add a URI to the restricted zone, in which the full domain name of the URI begins with numeric sequences similar to an IP address.  NOTE: if there is not an exploit scenario in which an attacker can trigger this behavior, then perhaps this issue should not be included in CVE.
