Kaspersky Anti-Virus for Unix/Linux File Servers 5.0-5 uses world-writable permissions for the (1) log and (2) license directory, which allows local users to delete log files, append to arbitrary files via a symlink attack on kavmonitor.log, or delete license keys and prevent keepup2date from properly executing.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
