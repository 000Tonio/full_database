# CVE-2005-2221

- Published: 2005-07-12T04:00:00

** DISPUTED **  Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Dragonfly Commerce allows remote attackers to modify SQL statements and possibly execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) key parameter to dc_Categoriesview.asp, (2) dc_productslist_Clearance.asp, (3) PID parameter to ratings.asp, (4) dc_Productsview.asp, (5) start, (6) key_mp, (7) searchtype, or (8) psearch parameters to dc_forum_Postslist.asp.  NOTE: the vendor has disputed this issue, saying that the error messages arise from invalid category and product numbers.  Assuming that this is the case, the issue still satisfies the CVE definition of "exposure."
