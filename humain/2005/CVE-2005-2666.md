# CVE-2005-2666

- Published: 2005-08-23T04:00:00

- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:30:00

SSH, as implemented in OpenSSH before 4.0 and possibly other implementations, stores hostnames, IP addresses, and keys in plaintext in the known_hosts file, which makes it easier for an attacker that has compromised an SSH user's account to generate a list of additional targets that are more likely to have the same password or key.

### CVSS Score: **1.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
