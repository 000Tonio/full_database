# CVE-2005-3347

- Published: 2005-11-18T02:02:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:33:00

Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in index.php in phpSysInfo 2.4 and earlier, as used in phpgroupware 0.9.16 and earlier, and egrouwpware before 1.0.0.009, allow remote attackers to include arbitrary files via .. (dot dot) sequences in the (1) sensor_program parameter or the (2) _SERVER[HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE] parameter, which overwrites an internal variable, a variant of CVE-2003-0536.  NOTE: due to a typo in an advisory, an issue in osh was inadvertently linked to this identifier; the proper identifier for the osh issue is CVE-2005-3346.
