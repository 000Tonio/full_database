Macromedia Flash plugin (1) Flash.ocx 7.0.19.0 (Windows) and earlier and (2) libflashplayer.so before 7.0.25.0 (Unix) allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via parameters to the ActionDefineFunction ActionScript call in a SWF file, which causes an improper memory access condition, a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-2628.
