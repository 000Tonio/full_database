# CVE-2005-4581

- Published: 2005-12-29T11:03:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:41:00

Buffer overflow in Electric Sheep 2.6.3 client allows local users to execute arbitrary code via a long window-id parameter. NOTE: because the program is not setuid and not normally called from remote programs, there may not be a typical attack vector for the issue that crosses privilege boundaries.  Therefore this may not be a vulnerability.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
