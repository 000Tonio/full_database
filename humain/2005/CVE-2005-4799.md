# CVE-2005-4799

- Published: 2005-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-20T01:29:00

Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Yet Another PHP Image Gallery (YaPIG) 0.95b and earlier allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via (1) the Homepage field (aka the Website field) in an "image-related comment" and (2) the img_size field in view.php.  NOTE: due to lack of details from the researcher, it is not clear whether the comment vector overlaps CVE-2005-1886. Successful exploitation requires that "register_globals" is enabled.

### CVSS Score: **5.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
