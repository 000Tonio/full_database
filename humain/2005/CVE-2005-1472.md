Certain system calls in Apple Mac OS X 10.4.1 do not properly enforce the permissions of certain directories without the POSIX read bit set, but with the execute bits set for group or other, which allows local users to list files in otherwise restricted directories.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
