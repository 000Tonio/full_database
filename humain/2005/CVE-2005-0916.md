# CVE-2005-0916

- Published: 2005-05-02T04:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T20:47:00

AIO in the Linux kernel 2.6.11 on the PPC64 or IA64 architectures with CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE enabled allows local users to cause a denial of service (system panic) via a process that executes the io_queue_init function but exits without running io_queue_release, which causes exit_aio and is_hugepage_only_range to fail.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
