# CVE-2005-2218

- Published: 2005-07-26T04:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:32:00

The device file system (devfs) in FreeBSD 5.x does not properly check parameters of the node type when creating a device node, which makes hidden devices available to attackers, who can then bypass restrictions on a jailed process.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
