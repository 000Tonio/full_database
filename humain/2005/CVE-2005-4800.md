# CVE-2005-4800

- Published: 2005-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-20T01:29:00

Direct static code injection vulnerability in Yet Another PHP Image Gallery (YaPIG) 0.95b and earlier allows remote authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary PHP code via the TestGallery parameter in a mod_info action to modify_gallery.php, which inserts the code into guid_info.php.  NOTE: this issue is easier to exploit due to a separate CSRF vulnerability.
