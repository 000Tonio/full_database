EMC Legato NetWorker, Sun Solstice Backup 6.0 and 6.1, and StorEdge Enterprise Backup 7.0 through 7.2 rely on AUTH_UNIX authentication, which relies on user ID for authentication and allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and gain privileges by spoofing a username or UID.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
