Secure Shell (SSH) 2 in Cisco IOS 12.0 through 12.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device reload) (1) via a username that contains a domain name when using a TACACS+ server to authenticate, (2) when a new SSH session is in the login phase and a currently logged in user issues a send command, or (3) when IOS is logging messages and an SSH session is terminated while the server is sending data.

### CVSS Score: **7.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
