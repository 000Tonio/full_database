IBM WebSphere Application Server 6.0 and earlier, when sharing the document root of the web server, allows remote attackers to obtain the source code for Java Server Pages (.jsp) via an HTTP request with an invalid Host header, which causes the page to be processed by the web server instead of the JSP engine.
