# CVE-2005-4635

- Published: 2005-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2011-03-08T02:28:00

The nl_fib_input function in fib_frontend.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.15 does not check for valid lengths of the header and payload, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid memory reference) via malformed fib_lookup netlink messages.

### CVSS Score: **5**
