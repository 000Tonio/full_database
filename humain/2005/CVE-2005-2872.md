# CVE-2005-2872

- Published: 2005-09-09T19:07:00

The ipt_recent kernel module (ipt_recent.c) in Linux kernel before 2.6.12, when running on 64-bit processors such as AMD64, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (kernel panic) via certain attacks such as SSH brute force, which leads to memset calls using a length based on the u_int32_t type, acting on an array of unsigned long elements, a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-2873.
