** DISPUTED **  JavaMail API, as used by Solstice Internet Mail Server POP3 2.0, does not properly validate the message number in the MimeMessage constructor in javax.mail.internet.InternetHeaders, which allows remote authenticated users to read other users' e-mail messages by modifying the msgno parameter.  NOTE: Sun disputes this issue, stating "The report makes references to source code and files that do not exist in the mentioned products."
