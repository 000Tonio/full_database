# CVE-2005-2371

- Published: 2005-07-26T04:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:32:00

Directory traversal vulnerability in Oracle Reports 6.0, 6i, 9i, and 10g allows remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files via (1) "..", (2) Windows drive letter (C:), and (3) absolute path sequences in the desname parameter.  NOTE: this issue was probably fixed by REP06 in CPU Jan 2006, in which case it overlaps CVE-2006-0289.
