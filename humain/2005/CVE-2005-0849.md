Multiple games developed by FUN labs, including 4X4 Off-road Adventure III, Big Game Hunter, Dangerous Hunts, Deer Hunt, Revolution, Secret Service, Shadow Force, and US Most Wanted, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash from invalid memory access) via a malformed join packet with values that cause the server to copy more memory than was actually provided in the packet.
