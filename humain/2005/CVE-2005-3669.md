Multiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) implementation in multiple Cisco products allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (device reset) via certain malformed IKE packets, as demonstrated by the PROTOS ISAKMP Test Suite for IKEv1.  NOTE: due to the lack of details in the Cisco advisory, it is unclear which of CVE-2005-3666, CVE-2005-3667, and/or CVE-2005-3668 this issue applies to.
