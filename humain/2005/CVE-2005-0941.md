# CVE-2005-0941

- Published: 2005-05-02T04:00:00

The StgCompObjStream::Load function in OpenOffice.org OpenOffice 1.1.4 and earlier allocates memory based on 16 bit length values, but process memory using 32 bit values, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a DOC document with certain length values, which leads to a heap-based buffer overflow.
