# CVE-2005-3887

- Published: 2005-11-29T21:03:00

Gadu-Gadu 7.20 does not properly handle MS-DOS device names in filenames, which allows remote attackers to (1) cause a denial of service (hang) via an image filename of AUX: sent twice (hang), or (2) write to the LPT1 port via a filename of "LPT1:". It appears to only affects 7.x versions.
