- Published: 2005-04-14T04:00:00

- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:29:00

The 64 bit ELF support in Linux kernel 2.6 before 2.6.10, on 64-bit architectures, does not properly check for overlapping VMA (virtual memory address) allocations, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code via a crafted ELF or a.out file.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
