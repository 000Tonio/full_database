# CVE-2005-1486

- Published: 2005-05-11T04:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:31:00

Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in FishCart 3.1 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) trackingnum, (2) reqagree, or (3) m parameter to upstracking.php or (4) nlst parameter to display.php.  NOTE: the vendor was not able to reproduce some of the reported vectors but believes that they have been addressed.  The original researcher is known to be unreliable.

### CVSS Score: **5**
