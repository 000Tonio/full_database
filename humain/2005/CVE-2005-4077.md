# CVE-2005-4077

- Published: 2005-12-08T01:03:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:40:00

Multiple off-by-one errors in the cURL library (libcurl) 7.11.2 through 7.15.0 allow local users to trigger a buffer overflow and cause a denial of service or bypass PHP security restrictions via certain URLs that (1) are malformed in a way that prevents a terminating null byte from being added to either a hostname or path buffer, or (2) contain a "?"  separator in the hostname portion, which causes a "/" to be prepended to the resulting string.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
