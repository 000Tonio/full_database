Multiple buffer overflows in Orenosv HTTP/FTP Server 0.8.1 allow remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (server crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via long arguments to FTP commands such as MKD, RMD, or DELE, which are processed by the (1) ftp_xlate_path, (2) ftp_is_canonical, or (3) os_fn_nativize functions, or (4) a long SSI command that is processed by the parse_cmd function in cgissi.exe.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
