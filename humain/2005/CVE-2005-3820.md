Multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in index.php in vTiger CRM 4.2 and earlier allow remote attackers to read or include arbitrary files, an ultimately execute arbitrary PHP code, via .. (dot dot) and null byte ("%00") sequences in the (1) module parameter and (2) action parameter in the Leads module, as also demonstrated by injecting PHP code into log messages and accessing the log file.
