The International Domain Name (IDN) support in Konqueror 3.2.1 on KDE 3.2.1 allows remote attackers to spoof domain names using punycode encoded domain names that are decoded in URLs and SSL certificates in a way that uses homograph characters from other character sets, which facilitates phishing attacks.
