# CVE-2005-3300

- Published: 2005-10-23T21:02:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:33:00

The register_globals emulation layer in grab_globals.php for phpMyAdmin before 2.6.4-pl3 does not perform safety checks on values in the _FILES array for uploaded files, which allows remote attackers to include arbitrary files by using direct requests to library scripts that do not use grab_globals.php, then modifying certain configuration values for the theme.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
