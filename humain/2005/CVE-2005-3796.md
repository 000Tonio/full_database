Direct static code injection vulnerability in admin_options_manage.php in AlstraSoft Affiliate Network Pro 7.2 allows attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via the number parameter.  NOTE: it is not clear from the original report whether administrator privileges are required.  If not, then this does not cross privilege boundaries and is not a vulnerability.
