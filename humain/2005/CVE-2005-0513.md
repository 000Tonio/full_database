PHP remote file inclusion vulnerability in mail_autocheck.php in the Email This Entry add-on for pMachine Pro 2.4, and possibly other versions including pMachine Free, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by directly requesting mail_autocheck.php and modifying the pm_path parameter to reference a URL on a remote web server that contains the code, a different vulnerability than CVE-2003-1086.
