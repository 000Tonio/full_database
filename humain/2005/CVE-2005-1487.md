** DISPUTED **  Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in FishCart 3.1 allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) cartid parameter to upstnt.php or (2) psku parameter to display.php.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this report, saying that they are forced SQL errors.  The original researcher is known to be unreliable.
