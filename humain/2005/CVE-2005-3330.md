The _httpsrequest function in Snoopy 1.2, as used in products such as (1) MagpieRSS, (2) WordPress, (3) Ampache, and (4) Jinzora, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands via shell metacharacters in an HTTPS URL to an SSL protected web page, which is not properly handled by the fetch function.
