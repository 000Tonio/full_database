Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Absolute Shopping Package Solutions (ASPS) Shopping Cart Professional 2.9d and earlier, and Lite 2.1 and earlier, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) srch_product_name parameter to adv_search.asp and (2) b_search parameter to bsearch.asp.  NOTE: the original disclosure was specifically only for an XSS issue, but the CVE description was for SQL injection.  Since the original disclosure, SQL injection vectors have been reported.  This CVE might be REJECTed or significantly altered pending additional information.
