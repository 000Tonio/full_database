# CVE-2005-1263

- Published: 2005-05-11T04:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:31:00

The elf_core_dump function in binfmt_elf.c for Linux kernel 2.x.x to 2.2.27-rc2, 2.4.x to 2.4.31-pre1, and 2.6.x to 2.6.12-rc4 allows local users to execute arbitrary code via an ELF binary that, in certain conditions involving the create_elf_tables function, causes a negative length argument to pass a signed integer comparison, leading to a buffer overflow.
