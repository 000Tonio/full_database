Multiple direct static code injection vulnerabilities in PHPGedView 3.3.7 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code via (1) the username field in login.php, or the (2) user_language, (3) user_email, and (4) user_gedcomid parameters in login_register.php, which is directly inserted into authenticate.php.
