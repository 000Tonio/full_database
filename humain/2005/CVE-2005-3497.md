** DISPUTED **  SQL injection vulnerability in process_signup.php in PHP Handicapper allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the serviceid parameter.  NOTE: on 20060210, the vendor disputed this issue, saying "this is 100% false reporting, this is a slander campaign from a customer who had a vulnerability in his SERVER not the software."  However, followup investigation strongly suggests that the original report is correct.
