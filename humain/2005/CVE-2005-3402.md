# CVE-2005-3402

- Published: 2005-11-01T12:47:00

- Modified: 2016-10-18T03:35:00

The SMTP client in Mozilla Thunderbird 1.0.5 BETA, 1.0.7, and possibly other versions, does not notify users when it cannot establish a secure channel with the server, which allows remote attackers to obtain authentication information without detection via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack that bypasses TLS authentication or downgrades CRAM-MD5 authentication to plain authentication.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
