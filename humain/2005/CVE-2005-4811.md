- Published: 2005-12-31T05:00:00

The hugepage code (hugetlb.c) in Linux kernel 2.6, possibly 2.6.12 and 2.6.13, in certain configurations, allows local users to cause a denial of service (crash) by triggering an mmap error before a prefault, which causes an error in the unmap_hugepage_area function.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
