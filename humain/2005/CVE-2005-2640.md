Behavioral discrepancy information leak in Juniper Netscreen VPN running ScreenOS 5.2.0 and earlier, when using IKE with pre-shared key authentication, allows remote attackers to enumerate valid usernames via an IKE Aggressive Mode packet, which generates a response if the username is valid but does not respond when the username is invalid.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
