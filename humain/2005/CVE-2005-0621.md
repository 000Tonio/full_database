Scrapland 1.0 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (server termination) by triggering an error, which is treated as a fatal error by the server, as demonstrated using (1) signed integers for size values, (2) an invalid model, (3) a "newpos" value that is less than or equal to a size value, or (4) partial packets.
