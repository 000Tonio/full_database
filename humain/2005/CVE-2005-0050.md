# CVE-2005-0050

- Published: 2005-05-02T04:00:00

The License Logging service for Windows NT Server, Windows 2000 Server, and Windows Server 2003 does not properly validate the length of messages, which leads to an "unchecked buffer" and allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code, aka the "License Logging Service Vulnerability."

### CVSS Score: **10**
