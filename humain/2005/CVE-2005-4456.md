Multiple buffer overflows in MailEnable Professional 1.71 and Enterprise 1.1 before patch ME-10009 allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via long (1) LIST, (2) LSUB, and (3) UID FETCH commands.  NOTE: it is possible that these are alternate vectors for the issue described in CVE-2005-4402.
