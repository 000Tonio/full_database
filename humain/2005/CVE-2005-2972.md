Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the RTF import feature in AbiWord before 2.2.11 allow user-assisted attackers to execute arbitrary code via an RTF file with long identifiers, which are not properly handled in the (1) ParseLevelText, (2) getCharsInsideBrace, (3) HandleLists, (4) or (5) HandleAbiLists functions in ie_imp_RTF.cpp, a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-2964.
