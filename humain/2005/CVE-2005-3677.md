Buffer overflow in RealNetworks RealPlayer 10 and 10.5 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted image in a RealPlayer Skin (RJS) file.  NOTE: due to the lack of details, it is unclear how this is different than CVE-2005-2629 and CVE-2005-2630, but the vendor advisory implies that it is different.
