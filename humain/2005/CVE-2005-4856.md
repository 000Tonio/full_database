The admin interface in eZ publish 3.5 before 3.5.7, 3.6 before 3.6.5, 3.7 before 3.7.3, and 3.8 before 20051110 does not properly handle authorization errors, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information and see the admin pagelayout and associated templates via a request with (1) "anything after the url" or (2) a "wrong url".
