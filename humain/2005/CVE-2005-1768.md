# CVE-2005-1768

- Published: 2005-07-11T04:00:00

- Modified: 2017-10-11T01:30:00

Race condition in the ia32 compatibility code for the execve system call in Linux kernel 2.4 before 2.4.31 and 2.6 before 2.6.6 allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel panic) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a concurrent thread that increments a pointer count after the nargs function has counted the pointers, but before the count is copied from user space to kernel space, which leads to a buffer overflow.

### CVSS Score: **3.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | LOCAL |
