# CVE-2005-3275

- Published: 2005-10-21T01:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:35:00

The NAT code (1) ip_nat_proto_tcp.c and (2) ip_nat_proto_udp.c in Linux kernel 2.6 before 2.6.13 and 2.4 before 2.4.32-rc1 incorrectly declares a variable to be static, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) by causing two packets for the same protocol to be NATed at the same time, which leads to memory corruption.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
