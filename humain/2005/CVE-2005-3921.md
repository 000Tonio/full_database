- Published: 2005-11-30T11:03:00

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Cisco IOS Web Server for IOS 12.0(2a) allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML by (1) packets containing HTML that an administrator views via an HTTP interface to the contents of memory buffers, as demonstrated by the URI /level/15/exec/-/buffers/assigned/dump; or (2) sending the router Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) packets with HTML payload that an administrator views via the CDP status pages.  NOTE: these vectors were originally reported as being associated with the dump and packet options in /level/15/exec/-/show/buffers.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
