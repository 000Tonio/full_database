SQL injection vulnerability in kb.php in Omnistar Live 5.2 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the (1) id and (2) category_id parameter.  NOTE: due to a typo, an Internet Explorer issue was incorrectly assigned this identifier, but the correct identifier is CVE-2005-3240.
