The MIDL_user_allocate function in the Microsoft Distributed Transaction Coordinator (MSDTC) proxy (MSDTCPRX.DLL) allocates a 4K page of memory regardless of the required size, which allows attackers to overwrite arbitrary memory locations using an incorrect size value that is provided to the NdrAllocate function, which writes management data to memory outside of the allocated buffer.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
