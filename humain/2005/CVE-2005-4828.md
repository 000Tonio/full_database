# CVE-2005-4828

- Published: 2005-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2010-04-02T06:31:00

Kolab Server 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 does not properly handle when a large email is sent with a "." in the wrong place, which causes kolabfilter to add another ".", which might break clear-text signatures and attachments.  NOTE: it is not clear whether this issue crosses privilege boundaries, so this might not be a vulnerability.
