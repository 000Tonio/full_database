# CVE-2005-2708

- Published: 2005-10-25T18:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:33:00

The search_binary_handler function in exec.c in Linux 2.4 kernel on 64-bit x86 architectures does not check a return code for a particular function call when virtual memory is low, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic), as demonstrated by running a process using the bash ulimit -v command.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
