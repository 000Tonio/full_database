# CVE-2005-4470

- Published: 2005-12-22T00:03:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:41:00

Heap-based buffer overflow in the get_bhead function in readfile.c in Blender BlenLoader 2.0 through 2.40pre allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a .blend file with a negative bhead.len value, which causes less memory to be allocated than expected, possibly due to an integer overflow.
