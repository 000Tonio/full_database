# CVE-2005-3365

- Published: 2005-10-30T14:34:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:36:00

Multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in DCP-Portal 6 and earlier allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands, possibly requiring encoded characters, via (1) the name parameter in register.php, (2) the email parameter in lostpassword.php, (3) the year parameter in calendar.php, and the (4) cid parameter to index.php.  NOTE: the mid parameter for forums.php is already associated with CVE-2005-0454.  NOTE: the index.php/cid vector was later reported to affect 6.11.
