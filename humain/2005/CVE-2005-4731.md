# CVE-2005-4731

- Published: 2005-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T20:57:00

The Next action in PEAR HTML_QuickForm_Controller 1.0.4 includes the SID in the URL even when session.use_only_cookies is configured, which allows remote attackers to obtain the SID via an HTTP Referer field and possibly other vectors. Upgrade to version 1.0.5 or higher, as it has been reported to fix this vulnerability. An upgrade is required as there are no known workarounds.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
