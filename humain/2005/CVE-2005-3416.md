# CVE-2005-3416

- Published: 2005-11-01T21:02:00

- Modified: 2016-10-18T03:35:00

phpBB 2.0.17 and earlier, when register_globals is enabled and the session_start function has not been called to handle a session, allows remote attackers to bypass security checks by setting the $_SESSION and $HTTP_SESSION_VARS variables to strings instead of arrays, which causes an array_merge function call to fail.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
