- Modified: 2020-10-05T21:15:00

commands.c in qmail, when running on 64 bit platforms with a large amount of virtual memory, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via a long SMTP command without a space character, which causes an array to be referenced with a negative index.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
