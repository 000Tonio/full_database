# CVE-2005-4203

- Published: 2005-12-13T11:03:00

- Modified: 2017-07-20T01:29:00

LogiSphere 0.9.9j does not restrict the number of messages that can be sent, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service by sending a large number of messages via the msg command.  NOTE: due to lack of appropriate details by the original researcher, it is unclear whether this description accurately reflects the discloser's claim and is distinct from the XSS issue.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
