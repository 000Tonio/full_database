# CVE-2005-2933

- Published: 2005-10-13T22:02:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:34:00

Buffer overflow in the mail_valid_net_parse_work function in mail.c for Washington's IMAP Server (UW-IMAP) before imap-2004g allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a mailbox name containing a single double-quote (") character without a closing quote, which causes bytes after the double-quote to be copied into a buffer indefinitely.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
