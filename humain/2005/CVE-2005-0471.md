Sun Java JRE 1.1.x through 1.4.x writes temporary files with long filenames that become predictable on a file system that uses 8.3 style short names, which allows remote attackers to write arbitrary files to known locations and facilitates the exploitation of vulnerabilities in applications that rely on unpredictable file names.

### CVSS Score: **5**
