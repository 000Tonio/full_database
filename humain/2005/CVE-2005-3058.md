Interpretation conflict in Fortinet FortiGate 2.8, running FortiOS 2.8MR10 and v3beta, allows remote attackers to bypass the URL blocker via an (1) HTTP request terminated with a line feed (LF) and not carriage return line feed (CRLF) or (2) HTTP request with no Host field, which is still processed by most web servers without violating RFC2616.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
