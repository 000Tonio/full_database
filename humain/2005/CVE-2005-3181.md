# CVE-2005-3181

- Published: 2005-10-12T13:04:00

- Modified: 2023-02-13T02:15:00

The audit system in Linux kernel 2.6.6, and other versions before 2.6.13.4, when CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL is enabled, uses an incorrect function to free names_cache memory, which prevents the memory from being tracked by AUDITSYSCALL code and leads to a memory leak that allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption).

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
