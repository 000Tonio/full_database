Yahoo! Messenger 6.0.0.1750, and possibly other versions before 6.0.0.1921, does not properly display long filenames in file dialog boxes, which could allow remote attackers to trick users into downloading and executing programs via file names containing a large number of spaces and multiple file extensions.
