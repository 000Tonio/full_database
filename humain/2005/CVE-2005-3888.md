# CVE-2005-3888

- Published: 2005-11-29T21:03:00

- Modified: 2017-07-20T01:29:00

Memory leak in Gadu-Gadu 7.20 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via multiple DCC packets with a code other than 2 and a large size field, which allocates memory for the packet but does not free it after the packet has been dropped. This vulnerability probably affects all 7.x versions of Gadu-Gadu prior to 7.20.
