# CVE-2005-4358

- Published: 2005-12-20T01:03:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:40:00

admin/admin_disallow.php in phpBB 2.0.18 allows remote attackers to obtain the installation path via a direct request with a non-empty setmodules parameter, which causes an invalid append_sid function call that leaks the path in an error message.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
