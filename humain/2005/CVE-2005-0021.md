- Published: 2005-05-02T04:00:00

Multiple buffer overflows in Exim before 4.43 may allow attackers to execute arbitrary code via (1) an IPv6 address with more than 8 components, as demonstrated using the -be command line option, which triggers an overflow in the host_aton function, or (2) the -bh command line option or dnsdb PTR lookup, which triggers an overflow in the dns_build_reverse function.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
