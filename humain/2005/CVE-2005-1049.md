# CVE-2005-1049

- Published: 2005-05-02T04:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:32:00

Multiple cross-site scripting vulnerabilities in PostNuke 0.760-RC3 allow remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) module parameter to admin.php or (2) op parameter to user.php. NOTE: the vendor reports that certain issues could not be reproduced for 760 RC3, or for .750.  However, the op/user.php issue exists when the pnAntiCracker setting is disabled.
