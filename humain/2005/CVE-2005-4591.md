# CVE-2005-4591

- Published: 2005-12-31T05:00:00

Heap-based buffer overflow in bogofilter 0.96.2, 0.95.2, 0.94.14, 0.94.12, and other versions from 0.93.5 to 0.96.2, when using Unicode databases, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via "invalid input sequences" that lead to heap corruption when bogofilter or bogolexer converts character sets.
