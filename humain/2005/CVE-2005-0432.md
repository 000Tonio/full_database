BEA WebLogic Server 7.0 Service Pack 5 and earlier, and 8.1 Service Pack 3 and earlier, generates different login exceptions that suggest why an authentication attempt fails, which makes it easier for remote attackers to guess passwords via brute force attacks.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
