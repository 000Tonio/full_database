config.inc.php in ATutor 1.5.1, and possibly earlier versions, uses an incomplete blacklist to check for dangerous file extensions, which allows authenticated administrators or educators to execute arbitrary code by uploading files with other executable extensions such as .inc, .php4, or others.

| --- | --- | --- |
