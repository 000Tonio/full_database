The Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKEv1) implementation in Juniper JUNOS and JUNOSe software for M, T, and J-series routers before release 6.4, and E-series routers before 7-1-0, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted IKE packets, as demonstrated by the PROTOS ISAKMP Test Suite for IKEv1.  NOTE: due to the lack of details in the advisory, it is unclear which of CVE-2005-3666, CVE-2005-3667, and/or CVE-2005-3668 this issue applies to.
