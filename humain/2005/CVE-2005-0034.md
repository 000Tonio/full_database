# CVE-2005-0034

- Published: 2005-05-02T04:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-11T01:32:00

An "incorrect assumption" in the authvalidated validator function in BIND 9.3.0, when DNSSEC is enabled, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (named server exit) via crafted DNS packets that cause an internal consistency test (self-check) to fail.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
