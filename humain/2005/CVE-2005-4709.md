# CVE-2005-4709

- Published: 2005-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2017-07-20T01:29:00

The popSubjectContext method in the SecurityAssociation class in JBoss Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) 3.0 RC3 maintains the threadPrincipal and threadCredential values from a previous client's authentication after termination of a client session, which allows remote attackers to gain the roles of an arbitrary previous client who had the same JBoss server thread.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
