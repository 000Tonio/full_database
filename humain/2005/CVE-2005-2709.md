The sysctl functionality (sysctl.c) in Linux kernel before 2.6.14.1 allows local users to cause a denial of service (kernel oops) and possibly execute code by opening an interface file in /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/, waiting until the interface is unregistered, then obtaining and modifying function pointers in memory that was used for the ctl_table.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**
