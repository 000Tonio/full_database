# CVE-2005-2097

- Published: 2005-08-16T04:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:32:00

xpdf and kpdf do not properly validate the "loca" table in PDF files, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (disk consumption and hang) via a PDF file with a "broken" loca table, which causes a large temporary file to be created when xpdf attempts to reconstruct the information.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
