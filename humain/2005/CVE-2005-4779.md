# CVE-2005-4779

- Published: 2005-12-31T05:00:00

- Modified: 2008-09-05T20:57:00

verifiedexecioctl in verified_exec.c in NetBSD 2.0.2 calls NDINIT with UIO_USERSPACE rather than UID_SYSSPACE, which removes the functionality of the verified exec kernel subsystem and might allow local users to execute Trojan horse programs.
