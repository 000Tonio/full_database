# CVE-2005-2459

- Published: 2005-08-23T04:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:32:00

The huft_build function in inflate.c in the zlib routines in the Linux kernel before 2.6.12.5 returns the wrong value, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (kernel crash) via a certain compressed file that leads to a null pointer dereference, a different vulnerability than CVE-2005-2458.
