# CVE-2005-1410

- Published: 2005-05-03T04:00:00

- Modified: 2018-10-19T15:31:00

The tsearch2 module in PostgreSQL 7.4 through 8.0.x declares the (1) dex_init, (2) snb_en_init, (3) snb_ru_init, (4) spell_init, and (5) syn_init functions as "internal" even when they do not take an internal argument, which allows attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly have other impacts via SQL commands that call other functions that accept internal arguments.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
