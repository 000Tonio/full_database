# CVE-2005-4256

- Published: 2005-12-15T11:03:00

Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in forum.asp in ASP-DEV XM Forum RC3 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the forum_title parameter.  NOTE: the provenance of this issue is unknown; the details are obtained solely from the BID.  In addition, its accuracy is in question because "forum_title" does not appear to be specified in the source code for XM Forum RC3.  It is possible, but not certain, that this is CVE-2004-2211.
