# CVE-2005-4895

- Published: 2012-07-25T19:55:00

- Modified: 2012-08-09T04:00:00

Multiple integer overflows in TCMalloc (tcmalloc.cc) in gperftools before 0.4 make it easier for context-dependent attackers to perform memory-related attacks such as buffer overflows via a large size value, which causes less memory to be allocated than expected.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
