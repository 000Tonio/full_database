Unrestricted file upload vulnerability in admin/admin.php in PHPKit 1.6.1 allows remote authenticated administrators to execute arbitrary PHP code by uploading a .php file to the content/images/ directory using images.php.  NOTE: if a PHPKit administrator must already have access to the end system to install or modify configuration of the product, then this issue might not cross privilege boundaries, and should not be included in CVE.
