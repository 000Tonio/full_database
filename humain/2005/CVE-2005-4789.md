- Modified: 2008-09-05T20:57:00

resmgr in SUSE Linux 9.2 and 9.3, and possibly other distributions, does not properly enforce class-specific exclude rules in some situations, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions for USB devices that set their class ID at the interface level.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |
