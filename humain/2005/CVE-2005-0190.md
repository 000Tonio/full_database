# CVE-2005-0190

- Published: 2004-09-29T04:00:00

Directory traversal vulnerability in RealPlayer 10.5 (6.0.12.1040) and earlier allows remote attackers to delete arbitrary files via a Real Metadata Packages (RMP) file with a FILENAME tag containing .. (dot dot) sequences in a filename that ends with a ? (question mark) and an allowed file extension (e.g. .mp3), which bypasses the check for the file extension.

### CVSS Score: **2.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | HIGH | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
