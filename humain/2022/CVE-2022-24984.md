# CVE-2022-24984

- Published: 2022-02-16T22:15:00

Forms generated by JQueryForm.com before 2022-02-05 (if file-upload capability is enabled) allow remote unauthenticated attackers to upload executable files and achieve remote code execution. This occurs because file-extension checks occur on the client side, and because not all executable content (e.g., .phtml or .php.bak) is blocked.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
