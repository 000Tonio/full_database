A remote, unauthenticated attacker could cause a denial-of-service of PHOENIX CONTACT FL MGUARD and TC MGUARD devices below version 8.9.0 by sending a larger number of unauthenticated HTTPS connections originating from different source IPâ€™s. Configuring firewall limits for incoming connections cannot prevent the issue.
