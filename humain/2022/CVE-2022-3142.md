The NEX-Forms WordPress plugin before 7.9.7 does not properly sanitise and escape user input before using it in SQL statements, leading to SQL injections. The attack can be executed by anyone who is permitted to view the forms statistics chart, by default administrators, however can be configured otherwise via the plugin settings.
