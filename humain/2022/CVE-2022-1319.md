# CVE-2022-1319

- Published: 2022-08-31T16:15:00

- Modified: 2022-11-07T19:09:00

A flaw was found in Undertow. For an AJP 400 response, EAP 7 is improperly sending two response packets, and those packets have the reuse flag set even though JBoss EAP closes the connection. A failure occurs when the connection is reused after a 400 by CPING since it reads in the second SEND_HEADERS response packet instead of a CPONG.
