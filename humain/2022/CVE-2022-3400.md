# CVE-2022-3400

- Published: 2022-10-28T17:15:00

- Modified: 2022-10-28T18:52:00

The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the bricks_save_post AJAX action in versions 1.0 to 1.5.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as a subscriber, to edit any page, post, or template on the vulnerable WordPress website.

### CVSS Score: **null**
