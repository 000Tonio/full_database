A vulnerability in the role-based access control (RBAC) functionality of the Brocade SANNav before 2.2.0 could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access resources that they should not be able to access and perform actions that they should not be able to perform. The vulnerability exists because restrictions are not performed on Server side to ensure the user has required permission before processing requests.
