Due to a missing authentication check, SAP Business Objects Business Intelligence Platform (Web Intelligence) - versions 420, 430, allows an authenticated non-administrator attacker to modify the data source information for a document that is otherwise restricted. On successful exploitation, the attacker can modify information causing a limited impact on the integrity of the application.
