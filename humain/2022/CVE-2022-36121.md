An issue was discovered in Blue Prism Enterprise 6.0 through 7.01. In a misconfigured environment that exposes the Blue Prism Application server, it is possible for an authenticated user to reverse engineer the Blue Prism software and circumvent access controls for the UpdateOfflineHelpData administrative function. Abusing this function will allow any Blue Prism user to change the offline help URL to one of their choice, opening the possibility of spoofing the help page or executing a local file.
