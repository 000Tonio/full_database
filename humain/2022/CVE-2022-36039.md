Rizin is a UNIX-like reverse engineering framework and command-line toolset. Versions 0.4.0 and prior are vulnerable to out-of-bounds write when parsing DEX files. A user opening a malicious DEX file could be affected by this vulnerability, allowing an attacker to execute code on the user's machine. A patch is available on the `dev` branch of the repository.
