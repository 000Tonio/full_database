Apache ShardingSphere-Proxy prior to 5.3.0 when using MySQL as database backend didn't cleanup the database session completely after client authentication failed, which allowed an attacker to execute normal commands by constructing a special MySQL client. This vulnerability has been fixed in Apache ShardingSphere 5.3.0.
