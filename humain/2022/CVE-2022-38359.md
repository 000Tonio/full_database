Cross-site request forgery attacks can be carried out against the Eyes of Network web application, due to an absence of adequate protections. An attacker can, for instance, delete the admin user by directing an authenticated user to the URL https://<target-address>/module/admin_user/index.php?DataTables_Table_0_length=10&user_selected%5B%5D=1&user_mgt_list=delete_user&action=submit by means of a crafted link.
