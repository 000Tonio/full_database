In preloader (usb), there is a possible out of bounds write due to a missing bounds check. This could lead to local escalation of privilege, for an attacker who has physical access to the device, with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is needed for exploitation. Patch ID: ALPS06160806; Issue ID: ALPS06160830.
