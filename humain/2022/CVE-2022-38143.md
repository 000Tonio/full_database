A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the way OpenImageIO v2.3.19.0 processes RLE encoded BMP images. A specially-crafted bmp file can write to arbitrary out of bounds memory, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.
