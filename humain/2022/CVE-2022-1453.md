# CVE-2022-1453

- Published: 2022-05-10T20:15:00

- Modified: 2022-05-18T14:47:00

The RSVPMaker plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated SQL Injection due to missing SQL escaping and parameterization on user supplied data passed to a SQL query in the rsvpmaker-util.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to steal sensitive information from the database in versions up to and including 9.2.5.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
