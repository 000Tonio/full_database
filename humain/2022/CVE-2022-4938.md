The WCFM Frontend Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.6.0 due to missing nonce checks on various AJAX actions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform a wide variety of actions such as modifying knowledge bases, modifying notices, modifying payments, managing vendors, capabilities, and so much more, via a forged request granted they can trick a site's administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. There were hundreds of AJAX endpoints affected.
