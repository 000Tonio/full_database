Excel-Streaming-Reader is an easy-to-use implementation of a streaming Excel reader using Apache POI. Prior to xlsx-streamer 2.1.0, the XML parser that was used did apply all the necessary settings to prevent XML Entity Expansion issues. Upgrade to version 2.1.0 to receive a patch. There is no known workaround.
