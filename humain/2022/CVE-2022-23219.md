The deprecated compatibility function clnt_create in the sunrpc module of the GNU C Library (aka glibc) through 2.34 copies its hostname argument on the stack without validating its length, which may result in a buffer overflow, potentially resulting in a denial of service or (if an application is not built with a stack protector enabled) arbitrary code execution.
