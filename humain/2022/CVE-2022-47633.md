An image signature validation bypass vulnerability in Kyverno 1.8.3 and 1.8.4 allows a malicious image registry (or a man-in-the-middle attacker) to inject unsigned arbitrary container images into a protected Kubernetes cluster. This is fixed in 1.8.5. This has been fixed in 1.8.5 and mitigations are available for impacted releases.
