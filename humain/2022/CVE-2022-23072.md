In Recipes, versions 1.0.5 through 1.2.5 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), in “Add to Cart” functionality. When a victim accesses the food list page, then adds a new Food with a malicious javascript payload in the ‘Name’ parameter and clicks on the Add to Shopping Cart icon, an XSS payload will trigger. A low privileged attacker will have the victim's API key and can lead to admin's account takeover.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
