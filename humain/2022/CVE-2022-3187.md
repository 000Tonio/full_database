Dataprobe iBoot-PDU FW versions prior to 1.42.06162022 contain a vulnerability where certain PHP pages only validate when a valid connection is established with the database. However, these PHP pages do not verify the validity of a user. Attackers could leverage this lack of verification to read the state of outlets.
