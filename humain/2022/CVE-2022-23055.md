In ERPNext, versions v11.0.0-beta through v13.0.2 are vulnerable to Missing Authorization, in the chat rooms functionality. A low privileged attacker can send a direct message or a group message to any member or group, impersonating themselves as the administrator. The attacker can also read chat messages of groups that they do not belong to, and of other users.
