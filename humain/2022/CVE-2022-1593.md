The Site Offline or Coming Soon WordPress plugin through 1.6.6 does not have CSRF check in place when updating its settings, and it also lacking sanitisation as well as escaping in some of them. As a result, attackers could make a logged in admin change them and put Cross-Site Scripting payloads in them via a CSRF attack
