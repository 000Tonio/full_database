Foresight GC3 Launch Monitor 1.3.15.68 ships with a Target Communication Framework (TCF) service enabled. This service listens on a TCP port on all interfaces and allows for process debugging, file system modification, and terminal access as the root user. In conjunction with a hosted wireless access point and the known passphrase of FSSPORTS, an attacker could use this service to modify a device and steal intellectual property.
