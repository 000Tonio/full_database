An information disclosure vulnerability exists in Rocket.Chat <v4.7.5 which allowed the "users.list" REST endpoint gets a query parameter from JSON and runs Users.find(queryFromClientSide). This means virtually any authenticated user can access any data (except password hashes) of any user authenticated.
