- Published: 2022-02-14T22:15:00

The rad_packet_recv function in opt/src/accel-pppd/radius/packet.c suffers from a buffer overflow vulnerability, whereby user input len is copied into a fixed buffer &attr->val.integer without any bound checks. If the client connects to the server and sends a large radius packet, a buffer overflow vulnerability will be triggered.
