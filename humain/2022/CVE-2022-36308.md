Airspan AirVelocity 1500 web management UI displays SNMP credentials in plaintext on software versions older than 15.18.00.2511, and stores SNMPv3 credentials unhashed on the filesystem, enabling anyone with web access to use these credentials to manipulate the eNodeB over SNMP. This issue may affect other AirVelocity and AirSpeed models.
