** DISPUTED ** OS Command injection vulnerability in sleuthkit fls tool 4.11.1 allows attackers to execute arbitrary commands via a crafted value to the m parameter. NOTE: third parties have disputed this because there is no analysis showing that the backtick command executes outside the context of the user account that entered the command line.
