An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an adjacent unauthenticated attacker to cause DoS (Denial of Service). If another router generates more than one specific valid OSPFv3 LSA then rpd will crash while processing these LSAs. This issue only affects systems configured with OSPFv3, while OSPFv2 is not affected. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S6; 19.3 version 19.3R2 and later versions; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R2-S8, 19.4R3-S9; 20.1 version 20.1R1 and later versions; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S5; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S5; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S4; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R3-S2; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R3-S1; 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S2; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2.
