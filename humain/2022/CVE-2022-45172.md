An issue was discovered in LIVEBOX Collaboration vDesk before v018. Broken Access Control can occur under the /api/v1/registration/validateEmail endpoint, the /api/v1/vdeskintegration/user/adduser endpoint, and the /api/v1/registration/changePasswordUser endpoint. The web application is affected by flaws in authorization logic, through which a malicious user (with no privileges) is able to perform privilege escalation to the administrator role, and steal the accounts of any users on the system.
