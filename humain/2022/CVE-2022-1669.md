# CVE-2022-1669

A buffer overflow vulnerability has been detected in the firewall function of the device management web portal. The device runs a CGI binary (index.cgi) to offer a management web application. Once authenticated with valid credentials in this web portal, a potential attacker could submit any "Address" value and it would be copied to a second variable with a "strcpy" vulnerable function without checking its length. Because of this, it is possible to send a long address value to overflow the process stack, controlling the function return address.

### CVSS Score: **5.5**
