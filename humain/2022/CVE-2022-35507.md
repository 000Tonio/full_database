# CVE-2022-35507

- Published: 2022-12-04T19:15:00

A response-header CRLF injection vulnerability in the Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) and Proxmox Mail Gateway (PMG) web interface allows a remote attacker to set cookies for a victim's browser that are longer than the server expects, causing a client-side DoS. This affects Chromium-based browsers because they allow injection of response headers with %0d. This is fixed in pve-http-server 4.1-3.
