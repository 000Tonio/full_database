# CVE-2022-4693

The User Verification WordPress plugin before 1.0.94 was affected by an Auth Bypass security vulnerability. To bypass authentication, we only need to know the userâ€™s username. Depending on whose username we know, which can be easily queried because it is usually public data, we may even be given an administrative role on the website.

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
