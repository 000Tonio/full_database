# CVE-2022-0656

- Published: 2022-04-25T16:16:00

The Web To Print Shop : uDraw WordPress plugin before 3.3.3 does not validate the url parameter in its udraw_convert_url_to_base64 AJAX action (available to both unauthenticated and authenticated users) before using it in the file_get_contents function and returning its content base64 encoded in the response. As a result, unauthenticated users could read arbitrary files on the web server (such as /etc/passwd, wp-config.php etc)

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
