A heap based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in tile decoding code of TIFF image parser in OpenImageIO master-branch-9aeece7a and v2.3.19.0. A specially-crafted TIFF file can lead to an out of bounds memory corruption, which can result in arbitrary code execution. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.
