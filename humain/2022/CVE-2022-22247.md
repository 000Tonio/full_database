An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in ingress TCP segment processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved allows a network-based unauthenticated attacker to send a crafted TCP segment to the device, triggering a kernel panic, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Continued receipt and processing of this TCP segment could create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-EVO; 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R2-EVO; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2-EVO. This issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 21.3R1-EVO.
