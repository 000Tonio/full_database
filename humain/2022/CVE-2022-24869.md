GLPI is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package, that provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. In versions prior to 10.0.0 one can use ticket's followups or setup login messages with a stylesheet link. This may allow for a cross site scripting attack vector. This issue is partially mitigated by cors security of browsers, though users are still advised to upgrade.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
