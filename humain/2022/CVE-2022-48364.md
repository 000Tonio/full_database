The undo_mark_statuses_as_sensitive method in app/services/approve_appeal_service.rb in Mastodon 3.5.x before 3.5.3 does not use the server's representative account, resulting in moderator identity disclosure when a moderator approves the appeal of a user whose status update was marked as sensitive.
