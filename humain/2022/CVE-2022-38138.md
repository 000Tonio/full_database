The Triangle Microworks IEC 61850 Library (Any client or server using the C language library with a version number of 11.2.0 or earlier and any client or server using the C++, C#, or Java language library with a version number of 5.0.1 or earlier) and 60870-6 (ICCP/TASE.2) Library (Any client or server using a C++ language library with a version number of 4.4.3 or earlier) are vulnerable to access given to a small number of uninitialized pointers within their code. This could allow an attacker to target any client or server using the affected libraries to cause a denial-of-service condition.
