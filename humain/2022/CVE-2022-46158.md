PrestaShop is an open-source e-commerce solution. Versions prior to 1.7.8.8 did not properly restrict host filesystem access for users. Users may have been able to view the contents of the upload directory without appropriate permissions. This issue has been addressed and users are advised to upgrade to version 1.7.8.8. There are no known workarounds for this issue.
