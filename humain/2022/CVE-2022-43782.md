Affected versions of Atlassian Crowd allow an attacker to authenticate as the crowd application via security misconfiguration and subsequent ability to call privileged endpoints in Crowd's REST API under the {{usermanagement}} path. This vulnerability can only be exploited by IPs specified under the crowd application allowlist in the Remote Addresses configuration, which is {{none}} by default. The affected versions are all versions 3.x.x, versions 4.x.x before version 4.4.4, and versions 5.x.x before 5.0.3
