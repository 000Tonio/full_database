A flaw was found in ovn-kubernetes. This flaw allows a system administrator or privileged attacker to create an egress network policy that bypasses existing ingress policies of other pods in a cluster, allowing network traffic to access pods that should not be reachable. This issue results in information disclosure and other attacks on other pods that should not be reachable.
