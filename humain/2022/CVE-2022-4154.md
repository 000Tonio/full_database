# CVE-2022-4154

- Published: 2022-12-26T13:15:00

- Modified: 2023-01-05T15:34:00

The Contest Gallery Pro WordPress plugin before 19.1.5 does not escape the wp_user_id GET parameter before concatenating it to an SQL query in management-show-user.php. This may allow malicious users with at administrator privileges (i.e. on multisite WordPress configurations) to leak sensitive information from the site's database.
