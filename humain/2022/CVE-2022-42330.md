Guests can cause Xenstore crash via soft reset When a guest issues a "Soft Reset" (e.g. for performing a kexec) the libxl based Xen toolstack will normally perform a XS_RELEASE Xenstore operation. Due to a bug in xenstored this can result in a crash of xenstored. Any other use of XS_RELEASE will have the same impact.
