The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Biography field featured on individual user profile pages due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping that allows users to encode malicious web scripts with HTML encoding that is reflected back on the page. This affects versions up to, and including, 2.3.2. Please note this issue was partially fixed in version 2.3.2 then subsequently fully patched in version 2.3.3.
