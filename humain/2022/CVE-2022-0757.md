Rapid7 Nexpose versions 6.6.93 and earlier are susceptible to an SQL Injection vulnerability, whereby valid search operators are not defined. This lack of validation can allow a logged-in, authenticated attacker to manipulate the "ANY" and "OR" operators in the SearchCriteria and inject SQL code. This issue was fixed in Rapid7 Nexpose version 6.6.129.
