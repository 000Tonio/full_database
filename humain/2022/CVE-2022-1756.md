# CVE-2022-1756

- Published: 2022-06-13T13:15:00

The Newsletter WordPress plugin before 7.4.5 does not sanitize and escape the $_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'] before echoing it back in admin pages. Although this uses addslashes, and most modern browsers automatically URLEncode requests, this is still vulnerable to Reflected XSS in older browsers such as Internet Explorer 9 or below.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
