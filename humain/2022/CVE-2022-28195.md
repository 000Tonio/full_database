NVIDIA Jetson Linux Driver Package contains a vulnerability in the Cboot ext4_read_file function, where insufficient validation of untrusted data may allow a highly privileged local attacker to cause a integer overflow, which may lead to code execution, escalation of privileges, limited denial of service, and some impact to confidentiality and integrity. The scope of impact can extend to other components.
