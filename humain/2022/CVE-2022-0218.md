# CVE-2022-0218

- Published: 2022-02-04T23:15:00

- Modified: 2022-02-09T03:25:00

The WP HTML Mail WordPress plugin is vulnerable to unauthorized access which allows unauthenticated attackers to retrieve and modify theme settings due to a missing capability check on the /themesettings REST-API endpoint found in the ~/includes/class-template-designer.php file, in versions up to and including 3.0.9. This makes it possible for attackers with no privileges to execute the endpoint and add malicious JavaScript to a vulnerable WordPress site.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
