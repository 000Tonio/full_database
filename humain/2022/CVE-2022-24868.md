GLPI is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package, that provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. In versions prior to 10.0.0 one can exploit a lack of sanitization on SVG file uploads and inject javascript into their user avatar. As a result any user viewing the avatar will be subject to a cross site scripting attack. Users of GLPI are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disallow SVG avatars.
