A remote file download issue can occur in some capabilities of Esri ArcGIS Server web services that may in some edge cases allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to induce an unsuspecting victim to launch a process in the victim's PATH environment. Current browsers provide users with warnings against running unsigned executables downloaded from the internet.
