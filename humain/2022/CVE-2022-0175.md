# CVE-2022-0175

- Published: 2022-08-26T18:15:00

- Modified: 2022-11-08T03:02:00

A flaw was found in the VirGL virtual OpenGL renderer (virglrenderer). The virgl did not properly initialize memory when allocating a host-backed memory resource. A malicious guest could use this flaw to mmap from the guest kernel and read this uninitialized memory from the host, possibly leading to information disclosure.
