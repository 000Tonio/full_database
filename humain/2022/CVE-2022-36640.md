** DISPUTED ** influxData influxDB before v1.8.10 contains no authentication mechanism or controls, allowing unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary commands. NOTE: the CVE ID assignment is disputed because the vendor's documentation states "If InfluxDB is being deployed on a publicly accessible endpoint, we strongly recommend authentication be enabled. Otherwise the data will be publicly available to any unauthenticated user. The default settings do NOT enable authentication and authorization."

### CVSS Score: **null**
