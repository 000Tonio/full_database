# CVE-2022-3897

- Published: 2022-11-29T21:15:00

- Modified: 2022-12-01T19:17:00

The WP Affiliate Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several parameters in versions up to, and including, 6.3.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

### CVSS Score: **null**
