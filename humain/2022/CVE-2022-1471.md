# CVE-2022-1471

- Published: 2022-12-01T11:15:00

SnakeYaml's Constructor() class does not restrict types which can be instantiated during deserialization.Â Deserializing yaml content provided by an attacker can lead to remote code execution. We recommend using SnakeYaml's SafeConsturctor when parsing untrusted content to restrict deserialization. We recommend upgrading to version 2.0 and beyond.
