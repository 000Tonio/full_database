A use-after-free flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s SGI GRU driver in the way the first gru_file_unlocked_ioctl function is called by the user, where a fail pass occurs in the gru_check_chiplet_assignment function. This flaw allows a local user to crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system.
