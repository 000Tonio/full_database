An issue was discovered in Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) 9.0. XSS can occur on the Classic UI login page by injecting arbitrary JavaScript code in the username field. This occurs before the user logs into the system, which means that even if the attacker executes arbitrary JavaScript, they will not get any sensitive information.
