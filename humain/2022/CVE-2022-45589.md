All versions before 8.0.1-R2022-10-RT and 7.3.1-R2022-09-RT of the Talend ESB Runtime are potentially vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks in the provisioning service only. Users of the provisioning service should upgrade to either 8.0.1-R2022-10-RT or 7.3.1-R2022-09-RT or a later release and use it in place of the previous version.
