solidus_backend is the admin interface for the Solidus e-commerce framework. Versions prior to 3.1.6, 3.0.6, and 2.11.16 contain a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. The vulnerability allows attackers to change the state of an order's adjustments if they hold its number, and the execution happens on a store administrator's computer. Users should upgrade to solidus_backend 3.1.6, 3.0.6, or 2.11.16 to receive a patch.
