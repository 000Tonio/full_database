Italtel NetMatch-S CI 5.2.0-20211008 has incorrect Access Control under NMSCI-WebGui/advancedsettings.jsp and NMSCIWebGui/SaveFileUploader. By not verifying permissions for access to resources, it allows an attacker to view pages that are not allowed, and modify the system configuration, bypassing all controls (without checking for user identity).
