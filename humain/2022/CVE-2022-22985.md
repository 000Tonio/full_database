The absence of filters when loading some sections in the web application of the vulnerable device allows attackers to inject malicious code that will be interpreted when a legitimate user accesses the specific web section where the information is displayed. Injection can be done on specific parameters. The injected code is executed when a legitimate user attempts to review history.
