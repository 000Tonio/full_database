# CVE-2022-23242

- Published: 2022-03-23T16:15:00

- Modified: 2022-03-29T01:09:00

TeamViewer Linux versions before 15.28 do not properly execute a deletion command for the connection password in case of a process crash. Knowledge of the crash event and the TeamViewer ID as well as either possession of the pre-crash connection password or local authenticated access to the machine would have allowed to establish a remote connection by reusing the not properly deleted connection password.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
