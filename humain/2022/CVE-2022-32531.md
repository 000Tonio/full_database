The Apache Bookkeeper Java Client (before 4.14.6 and also 4.15.0) does not close the connection to the bookkeeper server when TLS hostname verification fails. This leaves the bookkeeper client vulnerable to a man in the middle attack. The problem affects BookKeeper client prior to versions 4.14.6 and 4.15.1.
