# CVE-2022-4949

- Published: 2023-06-07T02:15:00

- Modified: 2023-06-07T02:44:00

The AdSanity plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'ajax_upload' function in versions up to, and including, 1.8.1. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with Contributor+ level privileges to upload arbitrary files on the affected sites server which makes remote code execution possible.

### CVSS Score: **null**
