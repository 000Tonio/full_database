Muhammara is a node module with c/cpp bindings to modify PDF with js for node or electron (based/replacement on/of galkhana/hummusjs). The package muhammara before 2.6.0; all versions of package hummus are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) when supplied with a maliciously crafted PDF file to be appended to another. This issue has been patched in 2.6.0 for muhammara and not at all for hummus. As a workaround, do not process files from untrusted sources.
