** DISPUTED ** AIOHTTP 3.8.1 can report a "ValueError: Invalid IPv6 URL" outcome, which can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS). NOTE: multiple third parties dispute this issue because there is no example of a context in which denial of service would occur, and many common contexts have exception handing in the calling application.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
