# CVE-2022-30271

- Published: 2022-07-26T23:15:00

The Motorola ACE1000 RTU through 2022-05-02 ships with a hardcoded SSH private key and initialization scripts (such as /etc/init.d/sshd_service) only generate a new key if no private-key file exists. Thus, this hardcoded key is likely to be used by default.
