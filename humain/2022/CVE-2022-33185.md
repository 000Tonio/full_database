Several commands in Brocade Fabric OS before Brocade Fabric OS v.9.0.1e, and v9.1.0 use unsafe string functions to process user input. Authenticated local attackers could abuse these vulnerabilities to exploit stack-based buffer overflows, allowing arbitrary code execution as the root user account.
