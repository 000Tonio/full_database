** DISPUTED ** The Cedar Gate EZ-NET portal 6.5.5 6.8.0 Internet portal has a call to display messages to users which does not properly sanitize data sent in through a URL parameter. This leads to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the ado.im reference has "no clear steps of reproduction."
