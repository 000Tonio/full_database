Forma LMS on its 3.1.0 version and earlier is vulnerable to a SQL injection vulnerability. The exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an authenticated attacker (with the role of student) to perform a SQL injection on the 'dyn_filter' parameter in the 'appLms/ajax.adm_server.php?r=widget/userselector/getusertabledata' function in order to dump the entire database.
