A Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) issue in ZoneMinder 1.36.12 allows an attacker to execute HTML or JavaScript code via the Username field when an Admin (or non-Admin users that can see other users logged into the platform) clicks on Logout. NOTE: this exists in later versions than CVE-2019-7348 and requires a different attack method.
