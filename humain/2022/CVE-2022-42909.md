WEPA Print Away does not verify that a user has authorization to access documents before generating print orders and associated release codes. This could allow an attacker to generate print orders and release codes for documents they donÂ´t own and print hem without authorization. In order to exploit this vulnerability, the user must have an account with wepanow.com or any of the institutions they serve, and be logged in.
