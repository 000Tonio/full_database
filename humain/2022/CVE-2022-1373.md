The “restore configuration” feature of Softing Secure Integration Server V1.22 is vulnerable to a directory traversal vulnerability when processing zip files. An attacker can craft a zip file to load an arbitrary dll and execute code. Using the "restore configuration" feature to upload a zip file containing a path traversal file may cause a file to be created and executed upon touching the disk.
