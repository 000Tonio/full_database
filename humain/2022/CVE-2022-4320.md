The WordPress Events Calendar WordPress plugin before 1.4.5 does not sanitize and escapes a parameter before outputting it back in the page, leading to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting which could be used against both unauthenticated and authenticated users (such as high-privilege ones like admin).
