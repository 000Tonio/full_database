PowerStore SW v2.1.1.0 supports the option to export data to either a CSV or an XLSX file. The data is taken as is, without any validation or sanitization. It allows a malicious, authenticated user to inject payloads that might get interpreted as formulas by the corresponding spreadsheet application that is being used to open the CSV/XLSX file.
