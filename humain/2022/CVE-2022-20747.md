A vulnerability in the History API of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive information on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to insufficient API authorization checking on the underlying operating system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted API request to Cisco vManage as a lower-privileged user and gaining access to sensitive information that they would not normally be authorized to access.
