** DISPUTED ** ComponentSpace.Saml2 4.4.0 Missing SSL Certificate Validation. NOTE: the vendor does not consider this a vulnerability because the report is only about use of certificates at the application layer (not the transport layer) and "Certificates are exchanged in a controlled fashion between entities within a trust relationship. This is why self-signed certificates may be used and why validating certificates isnâ€™t as important as doing so for the transport layer certificates."
