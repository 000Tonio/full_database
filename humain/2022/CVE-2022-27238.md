BigBlueButton version 2.4.7 (or earlier) is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the private chat functionality. A threat actor could inject JavaScript payload in his/her username. The payload gets executed in the browser of the victim each time the attacker sends a private message to the victim or when notification about the attacker leaving room is displayed.
