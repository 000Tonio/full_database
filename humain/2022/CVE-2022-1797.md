A malformed Class 3 common industrial protocol message with a cached connection can cause a denial-of-service condition in Rockwell Automation Logix Controllers, resulting in a major nonrecoverable fault. If the target device becomes unavailable, a user would have to clear the fault and redownload the user project file to bring the device back online.
