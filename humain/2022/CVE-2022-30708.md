# CVE-2022-30708

Webmin through 1.991, when the Authentic theme is used, allows remote code execution when a user has been manually created (i.e., not created in Virtualmin or Cloudmin). This occurs because settings-editor_write.cgi does not properly restrict the file parameter.

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |
