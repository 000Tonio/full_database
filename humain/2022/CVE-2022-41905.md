WsgiDAV is a generic and extendable WebDAV server based on WSGI. Implementations using this library with directory browsing enabled may be susceptible to Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This issue has been patched, users can upgrade to version 4.1.0. As a workaround, set `dir_browser.enable = False` in the configuration.
