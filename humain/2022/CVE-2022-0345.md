- Modified: 2022-03-08T16:34:00

The Customize WordPress Emails and Alerts WordPress plugin before 1.8.7 does not have authorisation and CSRF check in its bnfw_search_users AJAX action, allowing any authenticated users to call it and query for user e-mail prefixes (finding the first letter, then the second one, then the third one etc.).

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
