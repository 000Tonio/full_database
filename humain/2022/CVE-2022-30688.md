needrestart 0.8 through 3.5 before 3.6 is prone to local privilege escalation. Regexes to detect the Perl, Python, and Ruby interpreters are not anchored, allowing a local user to escalate privileges when needrestart tries to detect if interpreters are using old source files.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
