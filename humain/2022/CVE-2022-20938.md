A vulnerability in the module import function of the administrative interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to view sensitive information. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the XML syntax when importing a module. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a specially crafted XML file to the function. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to read sensitive data that would normally not be revealed.
