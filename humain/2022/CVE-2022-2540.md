# CVE-2022-2540

- Published: 2022-09-06T18:15:00

The Link Optimizer Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery to Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including 1.4.5. This is due to missing nonce validation on the admin_page function found in the ~/admin.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
