** DISPUTED ** quic-go through 0.27.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) via a Slowloris variant in which incomplete QUIC or HTTP/3 requests are sent. This occurs because mtu_discoverer.go misparses the MTU Discovery service and consequently overflows the probe timer. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this behavior should not be listed as a vulnerability on the CVE List.

### CVSS Score: **5**
