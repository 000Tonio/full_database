Zoom Client for Meetings for macOS (Standard and for IT Admin) starting with 5.10.6 and prior to 5.12.0 contains a debugging port misconfiguration. When camera mode rendering context is enabled as part of the Zoom App Layers API by running certain Zoom Apps, a local debugging port is opened by the Zoom client. A local malicious user could use this debugging port to connect to and control the Zoom Apps running in the Zoom client.
