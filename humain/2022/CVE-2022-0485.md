# CVE-2022-0485

- Published: 2022-08-29T15:15:00

- Modified: 2022-12-01T15:15:00

A flaw was found in the copying tool `nbdcopy` of libnbd. When performing multi-threaded copies using asynchronous nbd calls, nbdcopy was blindly treating the completion of an asynchronous command as successful, rather than checking the *error parameter. This could result in the silent creation of a corrupted destination image.
