In SAP Business One application when a service is created, the executable path contains spaces and isnâ€™t enclosed within quotes, leading to a vulnerability known as Unquoted Service Path which allows a user to gain SYSTEM privileges. If the service is exploited by adversaries, it can be used to gain privileged permissions on a system or network leading to high impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
