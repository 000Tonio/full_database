Mist is the command-line interface for the makedeb Package Repository. Prior to version 0.9.5, a user-provided `sudo` binary via the `PATH` variable can allow a local user to run arbitrary commands on the user's system with root permissions. Versions 0.9.5 and later contain a patch. No known workarounds exist.
