# CVE-2022-2430

- Published: 2022-09-06T18:15:00

- Modified: 2022-09-12T13:14:00

The Visual Composer Website Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the 'Text Block' feature in versions up to, and including, 45.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with access to the visual composer editor to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
