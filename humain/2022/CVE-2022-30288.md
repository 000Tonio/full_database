** DISPUTED ** Agoo before 2.14.3 does not reject GraphQL fragment spreads that form cycles, leading to an application crash. NOTE: the vendor has disputed this on the grounds that it is not the server's responsibility to "enforce all the various ways a developer could write code with logic errors."

### CVSS Score: **5**
