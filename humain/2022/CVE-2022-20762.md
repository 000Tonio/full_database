A vulnerability in the Common Execution Environment (CEE) ConfD CLI of Cisco Ultra Cloud Core - Subscriber Microservices Infrastructure (SMI) software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to escalate privileges on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient access control in the affected CLI. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating as a CEE ConfD CLI user and executing a specific CLI command.
