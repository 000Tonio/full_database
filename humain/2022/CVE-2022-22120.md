In NocoDB, versions 0.9 to 0.83.8 are vulnerable to Observable Discrepancy in the password-reset feature. When requesting a password reset for a given email address, the application displays an error message when the email isn't registered within the system. This allows attackers to enumerate the registered users' email addresses.
