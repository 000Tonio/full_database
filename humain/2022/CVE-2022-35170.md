SAP NetWeaver Enterprise Portal does - versions 7.10, 7.11, 7.20, 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50, not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs over the network, resulting in reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, therefore changing the scope of the attack. This leads to limited impact on confidentiality and integrity of data.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
