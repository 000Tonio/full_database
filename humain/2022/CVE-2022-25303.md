# CVE-2022-25303

The package whoogle-search before 0.7.2 are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via the query string parameter q. In the case where it does not contain the http string, it is used to build the error_message that is then rendered in the error.html template, using the [flask.render_template](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/api/flask.render_template) function. However, the error_message is rendered using the [| safe filter](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.1.x/templates/working-with-automatic-escaping), meaning the user input is not escaped.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
