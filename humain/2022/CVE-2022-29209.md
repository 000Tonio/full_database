# CVE-2022-29209

- Published: 2022-05-21T00:15:00

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the macros that TensorFlow uses for writing assertions (e.g., `CHECK_LT`, `CHECK_GT`, etc.) have an incorrect logic when comparing `size_t` and `int` values. Due to type conversion rules, several of the macros would trigger incorrectly. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.
