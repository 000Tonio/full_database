The Nintendo NetworkBuffer class, as used in Animal Crossing: New Horizons before 2.0.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a large UDP packet that causes a buffer overflow, aka ENLBufferPwn. The victim must join a game session with the attacker. Other affected products include Mario Kart 7 before 1.2, Mario Kart 8, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe before 2.1.0, ARMS before 5.4.1, Splatoon, Splatoon 2 before 5.5.1, Splatoon 3 before late 2022, Super Mario Maker 2 before 3.0.2, and Nintendo Switch Sports before late 2022.
