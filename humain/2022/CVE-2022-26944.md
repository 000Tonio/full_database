# CVE-2022-26944

- Published: 2022-06-02T18:15:00

Percona XtraBackup 2.4.20 unintentionally writes the command line to any resulting backup file output. This may include sensitive arguments passed at run time. In addition, when --history is passed at run time, this command line is also written to the PERCONA_SCHEMA.xtrabackup_history table. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2020-10997.
