All FLIR AX8 thermal sensor cameras version up to and including 1.46.16 are vulnerable to Remote Command Injection. This can be exploited to inject and execute arbitrary shell commands as the root user through the id HTTP POST parameter in the res.php endpoint. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the root privileges.
