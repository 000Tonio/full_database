# CVE-2022-2462

- Published: 2022-09-06T18:15:00

- Modified: 2022-09-09T17:10:00

The Transposh WordPress Translation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure to unauthenticated users in versions up to, and including, 1.0.8.1. This is due to insufficient permissions checking on the 'tp_history' AJAX action and insufficient restriction on the data returned in the response. This makes it possible for unauthenticated users to exfiltrate usernames of individuals who have translated text.

### CVSS Score: **null**
