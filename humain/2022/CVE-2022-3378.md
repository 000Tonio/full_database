Horner Automation's Cscape version 9.90 SP 7 and prior does not properly validate user-supplied data. If a user opens a maliciously formed FNT file, then an attacker could execute arbitrary code within the current process by accessing an uninitialized pointer, leading to an out-of-bounds memory write.
