The Royal Elementor Addons WordPress plugin before 1.3.56 does not have authorisation and CSRF checks when creating a template, and does not ensure that the post created is a template. This could allow any authenticated users, such as subscriber to create a post (as well as any post type) with an arbitrary title

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
