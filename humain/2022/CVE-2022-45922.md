An issue was discovered in OpenText Content Suite Platform 22.1 (16.2.19.1803). The request handler for ll.KeepAliveSession sets a valid AdminPwd cookie even when the Web Admin password was not entered. This allows access to endpoints, which require a valid AdminPwd cookie, without knowing the password.
