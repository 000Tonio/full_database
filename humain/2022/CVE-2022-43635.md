This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of TP-Link TL-WR940N 6_211111 3.20.1(US) routers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the httpd service, which listens on TCP port 80 by default. The issue results from the incorrect implementation of the authentication algorithm. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose stored credentials, leading to further compromise.
