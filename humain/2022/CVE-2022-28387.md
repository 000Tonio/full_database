An issue was discovered in certain Verbatim drives through 2022-03-31. Due to an insecure design, they can be unlocked by an attacker who can then gain unauthorized access to the stored data. The attacker can simply use an undocumented IOCTL command that retrieves the correct password. This affects Executive Fingerprint Secure SSD GDMSFE01-INI3637-C VER1.1 and Fingerprint Secure Portable Hard Drive Part Number #53650.
