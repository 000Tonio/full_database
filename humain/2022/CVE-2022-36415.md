A DLL hijacking vulnerability exists in the uninstaller in Scooter Beyond Compare 1.8a through 4.4.2 before 4.4.3 when installed via the EXE installer. The uninstaller attempts to load DLLs out of a Windows Temp folder. If a standard user places malicious DLLs in the C:\Windows\Temp\ folder, and then the uninstaller is run as SYSTEM, the DLLs will execute with elevated privileges.
