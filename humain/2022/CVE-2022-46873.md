Because Firefox did not implement the <code>unsafe-hashes</code> CSP directive, an attacker who was able to inject markup into a page otherwise protected by a Content Security Policy may have been able to inject executable script. This would be severely constrained by the specified Content Security Policy of the document. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 108.
