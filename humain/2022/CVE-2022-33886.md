A maliciously crafted MODEL and SLDPRT file can be used to write beyond the allocated buffer while parsing through Autodesk AutoCAD 2023 and 2022. The vulnerability exists because the application fails to handle crafted MODEL and SLDPRT files, which causes an unhandled exception. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.
