A vulnerability in the connection handling function in Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper traffic handling when platform limits are reached. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high rate of UDP traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause all new, incoming connections to be dropped, resulting in a DoS condition.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
