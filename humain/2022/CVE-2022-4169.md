# CVE-2022-4169

- Published: 2022-11-28T18:15:00

- Modified: 2022-12-01T23:01:00

The Theme and plugin translation for Polylang is vulnerable to authorization bypass in versions up to, and including, 3.2.16 due to missing capability checks in the process_polylang_theme_translation_wp_loaded() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update plugin and theme translation settings and to import translation strings.
