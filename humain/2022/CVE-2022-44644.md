In Apache Linkis <=1.3.0 when used with the MySQL Connector/J in the data source module, an authenticated attacker could read arbitrary local files by connecting a rogue MySQL server, By adding allowLoadLocalInfile to true in the JDBC parameter. Therefore, the parameters in the JDBC URL should be blacklisted. Versions of Apache Linkis <= 1.3.0 will be affected. We recommend users upgrade the version of Linkis to version 1.3.1
