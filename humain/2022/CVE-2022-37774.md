There is a broken access control vulnerability in the Maarch RM 2.8.3 solution. When accessing some specific document (pdf, email) from an archive, a preview is proposed by the application. This preview generates a URL including an md5 hash of the file accessed. The document's URL (https://{url}/tmp/{MD5 hash of the document}) is then accessible without authentication.
