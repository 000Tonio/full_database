Apache OFBiz uses the Birt plugin (https://eclipse.github.io/birt-website/) to create data visualizations and reports. In Apache OFBiz release 18.12.05, and earlier versions, by leveraging a vulnerability in Birt (https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=538142), an unauthenticated malicious user could perform a stored XSS attack in order to inject a malicious payload and execute it using the stored XSS.
