In Daybyday CRM, versions 2.0.0 through 2.2.0 are vulnerable to Missing Authorization. An attacker that has the lowest privileges account (employee type user), can view the appointments of all users in the system including administrators. However, this type of user is not authorized to view the calendar at all.
