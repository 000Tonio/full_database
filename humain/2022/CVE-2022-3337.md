It was possible for a user to delete a VPN profile from WARP mobile client on iOS platform despite the Lock WARP switch https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/warp-settings/#lock-warp-switch feature being enabled on Zero Trust Platform. This led to bypassing policies and restrictions enforced for enrolled devices by the Zero Trust platform.
