An improper privilege management vulnerability in McAfee Security Scan Plus (MSS+) before 4.1.262.1 could allow a local user to modify a configuration file and perform a LOLBin (Living off the land) attack. This could result in the user gaining elevated permissions and being able to execute arbitrary code due to lack of an integrity check of the configuration file.
