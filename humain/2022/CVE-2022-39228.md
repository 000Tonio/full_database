vantage6 is a privacy preserving federated learning infrastructure for secure insight exchange. vantage6 does not inform the user of wrong username/password combination if the username actually exists. This is an attempt to prevent bots from obtaining usernames. However, if a wrong password is entered a number of times, the user account is blocked temporarily. This issue has been fixed in version 3.8.0.
