The Content Mask WordPress plugin before 1.8.4.1 does not have authorisation and CSRF checks in various AJAX actions, as well as does not validate the option to be updated to ensure it belongs to the plugin. As a result, any authenticated user, such as subscriber could modify arbitrary blog options

### CVSS Score: **4**

| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
