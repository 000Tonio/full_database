An Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in Trend Micro Apex One and Apex One as a Service could allow a local attacker to disclose sensitive information on affected installations. Please note: an attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability. This is similar to, but not the same as CVE-2022-44647.
