A flaw was found in the Xorg-x11-server. The specific flaw exists within the handling of ProcXkbSetDeviceInfo requests. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a memory access past the end of an allocated buffer. This flaw allows an attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root.
