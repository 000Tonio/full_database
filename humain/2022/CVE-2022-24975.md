# CVE-2022-24975

- Published: 2022-02-11T20:15:00

- Modified: 2022-02-22T20:19:00

The --mirror documentation for Git through 2.35.1 does not mention the availability of deleted content, aka the "GitBleed" issue. This could present a security risk if information-disclosure auditing processes rely on a clone operation without the --mirror option.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
