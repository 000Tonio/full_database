A race condition was found in the Linux kernel's watch queue due to a missing lock in pipe_resize_ring(). The specific flaw exists within the handling of pipe buffers. The issue results from the lack of proper locking when performing operations on an object. This flaw allows a local user to crash the system or escalate their privileges on the system.
