An arbitrary code exection vulnerability exists in Linksys WUMC710 Wireless-AC Universal Media Connector with firmware <= 1.0.02 (build3). The do_setNTP function within the httpd binary uses unvalidated user input in the construction of a system command. An authenticated attacker with administrator privileges can leverage this vulnerability over the network via a malicious GET or POST request to /setNTP.cgi to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying Linux operating system as root.
