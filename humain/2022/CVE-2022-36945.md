The Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) receiving unit on certain Mazda vehicles through 2020 allows remote attackers to perform unlock operations and force a resynchronization after capturing three consecutive valid key-fob signals over the radio, aka a RollBack attack. The attacker retains the ability to unlock indefinitely.
