Akashi is an open source server implementation of the Attorney Online video game based on the Ace Attorney universe. Affected versions of Akashi are subject to a denial of service attack. An attacker can use a specially crafted evidence packet to make an illegal modification, causing a server crash. This can be used to mount a denial-of-service exploit. Users are advised to upgrade.
