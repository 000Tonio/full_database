The Zoom Client for Meetings (for Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, and Windows) before version 5.11.0 are susceptible to a URL parsing vulnerability. If a malicious Zoom meeting URL is opened, the malicious link may direct the user to connect to an arbitrary network address, leading to additional attacks including the potential for remote code execution through launching executables from arbitrary paths.
