An authenticated user can create a link with reflected Javascript code inside it for the graphs page and send it to other users. The payload can be executed only with a known CSRF token value of the victim, which is changed periodically and is difficult to predict.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
