Rockwell Automation ThinManager ThinServer versions 11.0.0 - 13.0.0 is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker could send a specifically crafted TFTP or HTTPS request, causing a heap-based buffer overflow that crashes the ThinServer process. If successfully exploited, this could expose the server to arbitrary remote code execution.
