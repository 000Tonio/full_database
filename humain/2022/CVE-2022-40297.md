** DISPUTED ** UBports Ubuntu Touch 16.04 allows the screen-unlock passcode to be used for a privileged shell via Sudo. This passcode is only four digits, far below typical length/complexity for a user account's password. NOTE: a third party states "The described attack cannot be executed as demonstrated."

### CVSS Score: **null**
