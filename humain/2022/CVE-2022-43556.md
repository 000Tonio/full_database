Concrete CMS (formerly concrete5) below 8.5.10 and between 9.0.0 and 9.1.2 is vulnerable to XSS in the text input field since the result dashboard page output is not sanitized. The Concrete CMS security team has ranked this 4.2 with CVSS v3.1 vector AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N Thanks @_akbar_jafarli_ for reporting. Remediate by updating to Concrete CMS 8.5.10 and Concrete CMS 9.1.3.
