Useful Simple Open-Source CMS (USOC) is a content management system (CMS) for programmers. Versions prior to Pb2.4Bfx3 allowed Sql injection in usersearch.php only for users with administrative privileges. Users should replace the file `admin/pages/useredit.php` with a newer version. USOC version Pb2.4Bfx3 contains a fixed version of `admin/pages/useredit.php`.
