The Bitcoin / Altcoin Faucet WordPress plugin through 1.6.0 does not have any CSRF check when saving its settings, allowing attacker to make a logged in admin change them via a CSRF attack. Furthermore, due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping, it could also lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting issues
