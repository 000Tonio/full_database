# CVE-2022-1969

The Mobile browser color select plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the admin_update_data() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
