# CVE-2022-4269

- Published: 2022-12-05T16:15:00

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel Traffic Control (TC) subsystem. Using a specific networking configuration (redirecting egress packets to ingress using TC action "mirred") a local unprivileged user could trigger a CPU soft lockup (ABBA deadlock) when the transport protocol in use (TCP or SCTP) does a retransmission, resulting in a denial of service condition.
