# CVE-2022-1912

- Published: 2022-07-18T17:15:00

- Modified: 2022-07-25T03:21:00

The Button Widget Smartsoft plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the smartsoftbutton_settings page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update the plugins settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
