An attacker who could have convinced a user to drag and drop an image to a filesystem could have manipulated the resulting filename to contain an executable extension, and by extension potentially tricked the user into executing malicious code. While very similar, this is a separate issue from CVE-2022-34483. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 102.
