The Simple Diagnostics Agent - versions 1.0 up to version 1.57, does not perform any authentication checks for functionalities that can be accessed via localhost on http port 3005. Due to lack of authentication checks, an attacker could access administrative or other privileged functionalities and read, modify, or delete sensitive information and configurations.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**
