# CVE-2022-4700

- Published: 2023-01-10T17:15:00

- Modified: 2023-01-13T07:56:00

The Royal Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to insufficient access control in the 'wpr_activate_required_theme' AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 1.3.59. This allows any authenticated user, including those with subscriber-level permissions, to activate the 'royal-elementor-kit' theme. If no such theme is installed doing so can also impact site availability as the site attempts to load a nonexistent theme.

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
