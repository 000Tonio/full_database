The Contest Gallery WordPress plugin before 19.1.5.1, Contest Gallery Pro WordPress plugin before 19.1.5.1 do not escape the cg_copy_id POST parameter before concatenating it to an SQL query in cg-copy-comments.php and cg-copy-rating.php. This may allow malicious users with at least author privilege to leak sensitive information from the site's database.
