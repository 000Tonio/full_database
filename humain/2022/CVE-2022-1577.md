The Database Backup for WordPress plugin before 2.5.2 does not have CSRF check in place when updating the schedule backup settings, which could allow an attacker to make a logged in admin change them via a CSRF attack. This could lead to cases where attackers can send backup notification emails to themselves, which contain more details. Or disable the automatic backup schedule
