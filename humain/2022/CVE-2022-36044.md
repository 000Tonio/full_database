Rizin is a UNIX-like reverse engineering framework and command-line toolset. Versions 0.4.0 and prior are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write when getting data from Luac files. A user opening a malicious Luac file could be affected by this vulnerability, allowing an attacker to execute code on the user's machine. Commits 07b43bc8aa1ffebd9b68d60624c9610cf7e460c7 and 05bbd147caccc60162d6fba9baaaf24befa281cd contain fixes for the issue.
