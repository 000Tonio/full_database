GLPI is a free asset and IT management software package. Prior to version 9.5.7, an entity administrator is capable of retrieving normally inaccessible data via SQL injection. Version 9.5.7 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, disabling the `Entities` update right prevents exploitation of this vulnerability.
