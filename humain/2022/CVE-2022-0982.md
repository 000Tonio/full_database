The telnet_input_char function in opt/src/accel-pppd/cli/telnet.c suffers from a memory corruption vulnerability, whereby user input cmdline_len is copied into a fixed buffer b->buf without any bound checks. If the server connects with a malicious client, crafted client requests can remotely trigger this vulnerability.
