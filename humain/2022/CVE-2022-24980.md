# CVE-2022-24980

- Published: 2022-02-19T04:15:00

An issue was discovered in the Kitodo.Presentation (aka dif) extension before 2.3.2, 3.x before 3.2.3, and 3.3.x before 3.3.4 for TYPO3. A missing access check in an eID script allows an unauthenticated user to submit arbitrary URLs to this component. This results in SSRF, allowing attackers to view the content of any file or webpage the webserver has access to.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
