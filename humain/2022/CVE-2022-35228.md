SAP BusinessObjects CMC allows an unauthenticated attacker to retrieve token information over the network which would otherwise be restricted. This can be achieved only when a legitimate user accesses the application and a local compromise occurs, like sniffing or social engineering. On successful exploitation, the attacker can completely compromise the application.
