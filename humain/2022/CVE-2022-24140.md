IOBit Advanced System Care 15, iTop Screen Recorder 2.1, iTop VPN 3.2, Driver Booster 9, and iTop Screenshot sends HTTP requests in their update procedure in order to download a config file. After downloading the config file, the products will parse the HTTP location of the update from the file and will try to install the update automatically with ADMIN privileges.
