An issue was discovered in Acuant AcuFill SDK before 10.22.02.03. It is used to install drivers from several different vendors. The Gemalto Document Reader child installation process is vulnerable to DLL hijacking, because it attempts to execute (with elevated privileges) multiple non-existent DLLs out of a non-existent standard-user writable location.
