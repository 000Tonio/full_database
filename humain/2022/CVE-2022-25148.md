The WP Statistics WordPress plugin is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to insufficient escaping and parameterization of the current_page_id parameter found in the ~/includes/class-wp-statistics-hits.php file which allows attackers without authentication to inject arbitrary SQL queries to obtain sensitive information, in versions up to and including 13.1.5.

### CVSS Score: **5**
