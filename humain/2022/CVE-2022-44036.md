** DISPUTED ** In b2evolution 7.2.5, if configured with admins_can_manipulate_sensitive_files, arbitrary file upload is allowed for admins, leading to command execution. NOTE: the vendor's position is that this is "very obviously a feature not an issue and if you don't like that feature it is very obvious how to disable it."
