Check Point ZoneAlarm before version 15.8.200.19118 allows a local actor to escalate privileges during the upgrade process. In addition, weak permissions in the ProgramData\CheckPoint\ZoneAlarm\Data\Updates directory allow a local attacker the ability to execute an arbitrary file write, leading to execution of code as local system, in ZoneAlarm versions before v15.8.211.192119
