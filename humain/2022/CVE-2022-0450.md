The Menu Image, Icons made easy WordPress plugin before 3.0.6 does not have authorisation and CSRF checks when saving menu settings, and does not validate, sanitise and escape them. As a result, any authenticate users, such as subscriber can update the settings or arbitrary menu and put Cross-Site Scripting payloads in them which will be triggered in the related menu in the frontend

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
