The web app client of TP-Link AX10v1 V1_211117 uses hard-coded cryptographic keys when communicating with the router. Attackers who are able to intercept the communications between the web client and router through a man-in-the-middle attack can then obtain the sequence key via a brute-force attack, and access sensitive information.
