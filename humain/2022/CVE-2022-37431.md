** DISPUTED ** A Reflected Cross-site scripting (XSS) issue was discovered in dotCMS Core through 22.06. This occurs in the admin portal when the configuration has XSS_PROTECTION_ENABLED=false. NOTE: the vendor disputes this because the current product behavior, in effect, has XSS_PROTECTION_ENABLED=true in all configurations.
