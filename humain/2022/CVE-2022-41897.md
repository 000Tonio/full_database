# CVE-2022-41897

- Published: 2022-11-18T22:15:00

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. If `FractionMaxPoolGrad` is given outsize inputs `row_pooling_sequence` and `col_pooling_sequence`, TensorFlow will crash. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit d71090c3e5ca325bdf4b02eb236cfb3ee823e927. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.11. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and TensorFlow 2.8.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
