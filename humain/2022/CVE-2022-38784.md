# CVE-2022-38784

- Published: 2022-08-30T03:15:00

- Modified: 2022-10-28T20:08:00

Poppler prior to and including 22.08.0 contains an integer overflow in the JBIG2 decoder (JBIG2Stream::readTextRegionSeg() in JBIGStream.cc). Processing a specially crafted PDF file or JBIG2 image could lead to a crash or the execution of arbitrary code. This is similar to the vulnerability described by CVE-2022-38171 in Xpdf.
