# CVE-2022-45933

- Published: 2022-11-27T03:15:00

KubeView through 0.1.31 allows attackers to obtain control of a Kubernetes cluster because api/scrape/kube-system does not require authentication, and retrieves certificate files that can be used for authentication as kube-admin. NOTE: the vendor's position is that KubeView was a "fun side project and a learning exercise," and not "very secure."

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
