http-swagger is an open source wrapper to automatically generate RESTful API documentation with Swagger 2.0. In versions of http-swagger prior to 1.2.6 an attacker may perform a denial of service attack consisting of memory exhaustion on the host system. The cause of the memory exhaustion is down to improper handling of http methods. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may to restrict the path prefix to the "GET" method as a workaround.
