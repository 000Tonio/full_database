# CVE-2022-29199

- Published: 2022-05-20T22:16:00

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of `tf.raw_ops.LoadAndRemapMatrix does not fully validate the input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used to trigger a denial of service attack. The code assumes `initializing_values` is a vector but there is no validation for this before accessing its value. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.
