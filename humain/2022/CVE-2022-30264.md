The Emerson ROC and FloBoss RTU product lines through 2022-05-02 perform insecure filesystem operations. They utilize the ROC protocol (4000/TCP, 5000/TCP) for communications between a master terminal and RTUs. Opcode 203 of this protocol allows a master terminal to transfer files to and from the flash filesystem and carrying out arbitrary file and directory read, write, and delete operations.
