A prototype pollution vulnerability exists in the function copy in dom.js in the xmldom (published as @xmldom/xmldom) package before 0.8.3 for Node.js via the p variable. NOTE: the vendor states "we are in the process of marking this report as invalid"; however, some third parties takes the position that "A prototype injection/Prototype pollution is not just when global objects are polluted with recursive merge or deep cloning but also when a target object is polluted."
