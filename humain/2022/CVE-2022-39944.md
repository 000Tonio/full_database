In Apache Linkis <=1.2.0 when used with the MySQL Connector/J, a deserialization vulnerability with possible remote code execution impact exists when an attacker has write access to a database and configures a JDBC EC with a MySQL data source and malicious parameters. Therefore, the parameters in the jdbc url should be blacklisted. Versions of Apache Linkis <= 1.2.0 will be affected, We recommend users to update to 1.3.0.
