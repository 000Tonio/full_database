The Contest Gallery WordPress plugin before 19.1.5.1, Contest Gallery Pro WordPress plugin before 19.1.5.1 do not escape the cg_deactivate and cg_activate POST parameters before concatenating it to an SQL query in 2_deactivate.php and 4_activate.php, respectively. This may allow malicious users with at least author privilege to leak sensitive information from the site's database.
