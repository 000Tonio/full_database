Reflected XSS (via AngularJS sandbox escape expressions) exists in Progress Ipswitch WS_FTP Server 8.6.0. This can lead to execution of malicious code and commands on the client due to improper handling of user-provided input. By inputting malicious payloads in the subdirectory searchbar or Add folder filename boxes, it is possible to execute client-side commands. For example, there is Client-Side Template Injection via subFolderPath to the ThinClient/WtmApiService.asmx/GetFileSubTree URI.
