An SQL injection vulnerability in Advantech iView 5.7.04.6469. The specific flaw exists within the ConfigurationServlet endpoint, which listens on TCP port 8080 by default. An unauthenticated remote attacker can craft a special column_value parameter in the setConfiguration action to bypass checks in com.imc.iview.utils.CUtils.checkSQLInjection() to perform SQL injection. For example, the attacker can exploit the vulnerability to retrieve the iView admin password.
