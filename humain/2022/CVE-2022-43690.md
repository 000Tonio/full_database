# CVE-2022-43690

- Published: 2022-11-14T23:15:00

- Modified: 2022-11-17T05:20:00

Concrete CMS (formerly concrete5) below 8.5.10 and between 9.0.0 and 9.1.2 did not use strict comparison for the legacy_salt so that limited authentication bypass could occur if using this functionality. Remediate by updating to Concrete CMS 9.1.3+ or 8.5.10+.

### CVSS Score: **null**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
