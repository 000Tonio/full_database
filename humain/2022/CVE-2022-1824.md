An uncontrolled search path vulnerability in McAfee Consumer Product Removal Tool prior to version 10.4.128 could allow a local attacker to perform a sideloading attack by using a specific file name. This could result in the user gaining elevated permissions and being able to execute arbitrary code as there were insufficient checks on the executable being signed by McAfee.
