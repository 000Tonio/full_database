Due to improper input sanitization in SAP Sourcing and SAP Contract Lifecycle Management - version 1100, an attacker can redirect a user to a malicious website. In order to perform this attack, the attacker sends an email to the victim with a manipulated link that appears to be a legitimate SAP Sourcing URL, since the victim doesnâ€™t suspect the threat, they click on the link, log in to SAP Sourcing and CLM and at this point, they get redirected to a malicious website.
