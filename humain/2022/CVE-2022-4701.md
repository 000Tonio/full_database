- Published: 2023-01-10T17:15:00

- Modified: 2023-01-13T07:56:00

The Royal Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to insufficient access control in the 'wpr_activate_required_plugins' AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 1.3.59. This allows any authenticated user, including those with subscriber-level permissions, to activate the 'contact-form-7', 'media-library-assistant', or 'woocommerce' plugins if they are installed on the site.

### CVSS Score: **null**
