NXP LPC55S66JBD64, LPC55S66JBD100, LPC55S66JEV98, LPC55S69JBD64, LPC55S69JBD100, and LPC55S69JEV98 microcontrollers (ROM version 1B) have a buffer overflow in parsing SB2 updates before the signature is verified. This can allow an attacker to achieve non-persistent code execution via a crafted unsigned update.
