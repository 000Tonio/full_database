ROG Live Serviceâ€™s function for deleting temp files created by installation has an improper link resolution before file access vulnerability. Since this function does not validate the path before deletion, an unauthenticated local attacker can create an unexpected symbolic link to system file path, to delete arbitrary system files and disrupt system service.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |
