Lack of validation of URLs causes Mirantis Container Cloud Lens Extension before v3.1.1 to open external programs other than the default browser to perform sign on to a new cluster. An attacker could host a webserver which serves a malicious Mirantis Container Cloud configuration file and induce the victim to add a new cluster via its URL. This issue affects: Mirantis Mirantis Container Cloud Lens Extension v3 versions prior to v3.1.1.
