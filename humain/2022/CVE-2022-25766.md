The package ungit before 1.5.20 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via argument injection. The issue occurs when calling the /api/fetch endpoint. User controlled values (remote and ref) are passed to the git fetch command. By injecting some git options it was possible to get arbitrary command execution.
