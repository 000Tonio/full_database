The user_token authorization header on the Ourphoto App version 1.4.1 /apiv1/* end-points is not implemented properly. Removing the value causes all requests to succeed, bypassing authorization and session management. The impact of this vulnerability allows an attacker POST api calls with other users unique identifiers and enumerate information of all other end-users.
