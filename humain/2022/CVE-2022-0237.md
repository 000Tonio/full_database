Rapid7 Insight Agent versions 3.1.2.38 and earlier suffer from a privilege escalation vulnerability, whereby an attacker can hijack the flow of execution due to an unquoted argument to the runas.exe command used by the ir_agent.exe component, resulting in elevated rights and persistent access to the machine. This issue was fixed in Rapid7 Insight Agent version 3.1.3.80.
