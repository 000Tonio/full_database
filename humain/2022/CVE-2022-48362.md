Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central and Desktop Central MSP before 10.1.2137.2 allow directory traversal via computerName to AgentLogUploadServlet. A remote, authenticated attacker could upload arbitrary code that would be executed when Desktop Central is restarted. (The attacker could authenticate by exploiting CVE-2021-44515.)
