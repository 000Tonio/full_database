A vulnerability in the web management interface of the Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied parameters for certain API endpoints. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted input to an affected API endpoint. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the device with low system privileges. To successfully exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need valid credentials for a user with Device permissions: by default, only Administrators, Security Approvers and Network Admins user accounts have these permissions.
