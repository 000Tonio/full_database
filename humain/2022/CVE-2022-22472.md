IBM Spectrum Protect Plus Container Backup and Restore (10.1.5 through 10.1.10.2 for Kubernetes and 10.1.7 through 10.1.10.2 for Red Hat OpenShift) could allow a remote attacker to bypass IBM Spectrum Protect Plus role based access control restrictions, caused by improper disclosure of session information. By retrieving the logs of a container an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass login security of the IBM Spectrum Protect Plus server and gain unauthorized access based on the permissions of the IBM Spectrum Protect Plus user to the vulnerable Spectrum Protect Plus server software. IBM X-Force ID: 225340.
