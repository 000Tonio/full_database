ImpressCMS before 1.4.2 allows unauthenticated remote code execution via ...../// directory traversal in origName or imageName, leading to unsafe interaction with the CKEditor processImage.php script. The payload may be placed in PHP_SESSION_UPLOAD_PROGRESS when the PHP installation supports upload_progress.
