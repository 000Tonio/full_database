The WP OAuth Server (OAuth Authentication) WordPress plugin before 4.2.5 does not have CSRF check when deleting a client, and does not ensure that the object to be deleted is actually a client, which could allow attackers to make a logged in admin delete arbitrary client and post via a CSRF attack.
