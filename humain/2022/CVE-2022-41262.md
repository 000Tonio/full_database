Due to insufficient input validation, SAP NetWeaver AS Java (HTTP Provider Service) - version 7.50, allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject a script into a web request header. On successful exploitation, an attacker can view or modify information causing a limited impact on the confidentiality and integrity of the application.
