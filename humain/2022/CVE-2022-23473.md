Tuleap is an Open Source Suite to improve management of software developments and collaboration. In versions prior to 14.2.99.148, Authorizations are not properly verified when accessing MediaWiki standalone resources. Users with read only permissions for pages are able to also edit them. This only affects the MediaWiki standalone plugin. This issue is patched in versions Tuleap Community Edition 14.2.99.148, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 14.2-5, and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 14.1-6.
