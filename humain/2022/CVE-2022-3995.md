# CVE-2022-3995

- Published: 2022-11-29T21:15:00

- Modified: 2022-12-01T19:56:00

The TeraWallet plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in versions up to, and including, 1.4.3. This is due to insufficient validation of the user-controlled key on the lock_unlock_terawallet AJAX action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to lock/unlock other users wallets.
