# CVE-2022-4702

- Published: 2023-01-10T17:15:00

- Modified: 2023-01-13T07:56:00

The Royal Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to insufficient access control in the 'wpr_fix_royal_compatibility' AJAX action in versions up to, and including, 1.3.59. This allows any authenticated user, including those with subscriber-level permissions, to deactivate every plugin on the site unless it is part of an extremely limited hardcoded selection. This also switches the site to the 'royal-elementor-kit' theme, potentially resulting in availability issues.

### CVSS Score: **null**
