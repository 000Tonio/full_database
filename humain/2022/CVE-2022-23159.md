Dell PowerScale OneFS, 8.2.2 - 9.3.0.x, contain a missing release of memory after effective lifetime vulnerability. An authenticated user with ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_SSH and/or ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_CONSOLE and ISI_PRIV_AUTH_PROVIDERS privileges could exploit this vulnerability, leading to a Denial-Of-Service. This can also impact a cluster in Compliance mode. Dell recommends to update at the earliest opportunity.
