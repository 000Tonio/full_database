- Published: 2022-04-25T16:16:00

- Modified: 2022-05-03T18:56:00

The myCred WordPress plugin before 2.4.4 does not have any authorisation and CSRF checks in the mycred-tools-import-export AJAX action, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscribers, to call it and import mycred setup, thus creating badges, managing points or creating arbitrary posts.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
