The All-in-One WP Migration WordPress plugin before 7.63 uses the wrong content type, and does not properly escape the response from the ai1wm_export AJAX action, allowing an attacker to craft a request that when submitted by any visitor will inject arbitrary html or javascript into the response that will be executed in the victims session. Note: This requires knowledge of a static secret key
