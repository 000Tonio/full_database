# CVE-2022-39188

- Published: 2022-09-02T05:15:00

- Modified: 2022-11-21T19:45:00

An issue was discovered in include/asm-generic/tlb.h in the Linux kernel before 5.19. Because of a race condition (unmap_mapping_range versus munmap), a device driver can free a page while it still has stale TLB entries. This only occurs in situations with VM_PFNMAP VMAs.
