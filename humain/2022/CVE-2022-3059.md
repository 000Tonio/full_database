The application was vulnerable to multiple instances of SQL injection (authenticated and unauthenticated) through a vulnerable parameter. Due to the stacked query support, complex SQL commands could be crafted and injected into the vulnerable parameter and using a sleep based inferential SQL injection it was possible to extract data from the database.
