A buffer overflow was discovered in NTFS-3G before 2022.10.3. Crafted metadata in an NTFS image can cause code execution. A local attacker can exploit this if the ntfs-3g binary is setuid root. A physically proximate attacker can exploit this if NTFS-3G software is configured to execute upon attachment of an external storage device.
