Claroline 13.5.7 and prior allows an authenticated attacker to elevate privileges via the arbitrary creation of a privileged user. By combining the XSS vulnerability present in several upload forms and a javascript request to the present API, it is possible to trigger the creation of a user with administrative rights by opening an SVG file as an administrator user.
