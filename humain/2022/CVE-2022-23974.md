In 0.9.3 or older versions of Apache Pinot segment upload path allowed segment directories to be imported into pinot tables. In pinot installations that allow open access to the controller a specially crafted request can potentially be exploited to cause disruption in pinot service. Pinot release 0.10.0 fixes this. See https://docs.pinot.apache.org/basics/releases/0.10.0
