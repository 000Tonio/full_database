An integer overflow in the processing of loaded 2D images leads to a write-what-where vulnerability and an out-of-bounds read vulnerability, allowing an attacker to leak sensitive information or achieve code execution in the context of the Blender process when a specially crafted image file is loaded. This flaw affects Blender versions prior to 2.83.19, 2.93.8 and 3.1.
