Vulnerable versions of the JupiterX Theme (<=2.0.6) allow any logged-in user, including subscriber-level users, to access any of the functions registered in lib/api/api/ajax.php, which also grant access to the jupiterx_api_ajax_ actions registered by the JupiterX Core Plugin (<=2.0.6). This includes the ability to deactivate arbitrary plugins as well as update the themeâ€™s API key.
