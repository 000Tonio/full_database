Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Agent for Windows relies on an inherently dangerous function that could enable an unprivileged local Windows user to run arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. All versions prior to 7.12.1 are affected. Agents for MacOS and Linux and Cloud are unaffected. Proofpoint has released fixed software version 7.12.1. The fixed software versions are available through the customer support portal.
