# CVE-2022-24858

- Published: 2022-04-19T23:15:00

- Modified: 2022-04-29T23:53:00

next-auth v3 users before version 3.29.2 are impacted. next-auth version 4 users before version 4.3.2 are also impacted. Upgrading to 3.29.2 or 4.3.2 will patch this vulnerability. If you are not able to upgrade for any reason, you can add a configuration to your callbacks option. If you already have a `redirect` callback, make sure that you match the incoming `url` origin against the `baseUrl`.
