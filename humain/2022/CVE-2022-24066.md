# CVE-2022-24066

- Published: 2022-04-01T20:15:00

The package simple-git before 3.5.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection due to an incomplete fix of [CVE-2022-24433](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SIMPLEGIT-2421199) which only patches against the git fetch attack vector. A similar use of the --upload-pack feature of git is also supported for git clone, which the prior fix didn't cover.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
