An issue was discovered in BACKCLICK Professional 5.9.63. Due to improper validation or sanitization of upload filenames, an externally reachable, unauthenticated update function permits writing files outside the intended target location. Achieving remote code execution is possible, e.g., by uploading an executable file.
