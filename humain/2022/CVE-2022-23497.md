FreshRSS is a free, self-hostable RSS aggregator. User configuration files can be accessed by a remote user. In addition to user preferences, such configurations contain hashed passwords (brypt with cost 9, salted) of FreshRSS Web interface. If the API is used, the configuration might contain a hashed password (brypt with cost 9, salted) of the GReader API, and a hashed password (MD5 salted) of the Fever API. Users should update to version 1.20.2 or edge. Users unable to upgrade can apply the patch manually or delete the file `./FreshRSS/p/ext.php`.
