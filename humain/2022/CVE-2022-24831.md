OpenClinica is an open source software for Electronic Data Capture (EDC) and Clinical Data Management (CDM). Versions prior to 3.16.1 are vulnerable to SQL injection due to the use of string concatenation to create SQL queries instead of prepared statements. No known workarounds exist. This issue has been patched in 3.16.1, 3.15.9, 3.14.1, and 3.13.1 and users are advised to upgrade.
