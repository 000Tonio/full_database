A Cross-Site Request Forgery exists in endpoints of the “Operation” web application that interpret and execute Axon language queries, due to the missing validation of anti-CSRF tokens or other origin checks. By convincing a victim to click on a malicious link or visit a specifically crafted webpage while logged-in to the device web application, a remote unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary Axon queries against the device.
