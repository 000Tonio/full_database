SAP Enterprise Threat Detection (ETD) - version 2.0, does not sufficiently encode user-controlled inputs which may lead to an unauthorized attacker possibly exploit XSS vulnerability. The UIs in ETD are using SAP UI5 standard controls, the UI5 framework provides automated output encoding for its standard controls. This output encoding prevents stored malicious user input from being executed when it is reflected in the UI.
