It was possible to bypass policies configured for Zero Trust Secure Web Gateway by using warp-cli 'set-custom-endpoint' subcommand. Using this command with an unreachable endpoint caused the WARP Client to disconnect and allowed bypassing administrative restrictions on a Zero Trust enrolled endpoint.
