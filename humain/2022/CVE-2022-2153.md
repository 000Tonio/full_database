# CVE-2022-2153

- Published: 2022-08-31T16:15:00

- Modified: 2022-11-21T19:45:00

A flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s KVM when attempting to set a SynIC IRQ. This issue makes it possible for a misbehaving VMM to write to SYNIC/STIMER MSRs, causing a NULL pointer dereference. This flaw allows an unprivileged local attacker on the host to issue specific ioctl calls, causing a kernel oops condition that results in a denial of service.
