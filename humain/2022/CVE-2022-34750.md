# CVE-2022-34750

- Published: 2022-06-28T13:15:00

An issue was discovered in MediaWiki through 1.38.1. The lemma length of a Wikibase lexeme is currently capped at a thousand characters. Unfortunately, this length is not validated, allowing much larger lexemes to be created, which introduces various denial-of-service attack vectors within the Wikibase and WikibaseLexeme extensions. This is related to Special:NewLexeme and Special:NewProperty.

### CVSS Score: **5**
