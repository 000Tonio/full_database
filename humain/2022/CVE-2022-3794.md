# CVE-2022-3794

- Published: 2022-12-22T21:15:00

The Jeg Elementor Kit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass in various AJAX actions in versions up to, and including, 2.5.6. Authenticated users can use an easily available nonce value to create header templates and make additional changes to the site, as the plugin does not use capability checks for this purpose.

### CVSS Score: **null**
