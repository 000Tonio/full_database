The Student Result or Employee Database WordPress plugin before 1.7.5 does not have CSRF in its AJAX actions, allowing attackers to make logged in user with a role as low as contributor to add/edit and delete students via CSRF attacks. Furthermore, due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping, it could also lead to Stored Cross-Site scripting
