In OpenShift Container Platform, a user with permissions to create or modify Routes can craft a payload that inserts a malformed entry into one of the cluster router's HAProxy configuration files. This malformed entry can match any arbitrary hostname, or all hostnames in the cluster, and direct traffic to an arbitrary application within the cluster, including one under attacker control.
