Forms generated by JQueryForm.com before 2022-02-05 allow remote attackers to obtain the URI to any uploaded file by capturing the POST response. When chained with CVE-2022-24984, this could lead to unauthenticated remote code execution on the underlying web server. This occurs because the Unique ID field is contained in the POST response upon submitting a form.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
