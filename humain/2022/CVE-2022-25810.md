The Transposh WordPress Translation WordPress plugin through 1.0.8 exposes a couple of sensitive actions such has â€œtp_resetâ€? under the Utilities tab (/wp-admin/admin.php?page=tp_utils), which can be used/executed as the lowest-privileged user. Basically all Utilities functionalities are vulnerable this way, which involves resetting configurations and backup/restore operations.
