In Apache OFBiz, versions 18.12.05 and earlier, an attacker acting as an anonymous user of the ecommerce plugin, can insert a malicious content in a message “Subject” field from the "Contact us" page. Then a party manager needs to list the communications in the party component to activate the SSTI. A RCE is then possible.
