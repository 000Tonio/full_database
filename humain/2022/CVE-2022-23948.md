# CVE-2022-23948

- Published: 2022-09-21T19:15:00

- Modified: 2022-09-22T16:23:00

A flaw was found in Keylime before 6.3.0. The logic in the Keylime agent for checking for a secure mount can be fooled by previously created unprivileged mounts allowing secrets to be leaked to other processes on the host.
