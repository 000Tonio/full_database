Gin-vue-admin is a backstage management system based on vue and gin, which separates the front and rear of the full stack. Versions prior to 2.5.4 contain a file upload ability. The affected code fails to validate fileMd5 and fileName parameters, resulting in an arbitrary file being read. This issue is patched in 2.5.4b. There are no known workarounds.
