Authenticated command injection vulnerabilities exist in the AOS-CX Network Analytics Engine via NAE scripts. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities result in the ability to execute arbitrary commands as a privileged user on the underlying operating system, leading to a complete compromise of the switch running AOS-CX in ArubaOS-CX Switches version(s): AOS-CX 10.10.xxxx: 10.10.0002 and below, AOS-CX 10.09.xxxx: 10.09.1030 and below, AOS-CX 10.08.xxxx: 10.08.1070 and below, AOS-CX 10.06.xxxx: 10.06.0210 and below. Aruba has released upgrades for ArubaOS-CX Switch Devices that address these security vulnerabilities.
