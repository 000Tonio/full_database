# CVE-2022-29582

- Published: 2022-04-22T16:15:00

In the Linux kernel before 5.17.3, fs/io_uring.c has a use-after-free due to a race condition in io_uring timeouts. This can be triggered by a local user who has no access to any user namespace; however, the race condition perhaps can only be exploited infrequently.

### CVSS Score: **6.9**
