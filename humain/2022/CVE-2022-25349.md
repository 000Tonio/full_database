All versions of package materialize-css are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) due to improper escape of user input (such as &lt;not-a-tag /&gt;) that is being parsed as HTML/JavaScript, and inserted into the Document Object Model (DOM). This vulnerability can be exploited when the user-input is provided to the autocomplete component.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
