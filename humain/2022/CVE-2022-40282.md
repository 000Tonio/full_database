# CVE-2022-40282

- Published: 2022-11-25T05:15:00

The web server of Hirschmann BAT-C2 before 09.13.01.00R04 allows authenticated command injection. This allows an authenticated attacker to pass commands to the shell of the system because the dir parameter of the FsCreateDir Ajax function is not sufficiently sanitized. The vendor's ID is BSECV-2022-21.

### CVSS Score: **null**
