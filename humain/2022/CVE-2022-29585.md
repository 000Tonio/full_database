In Mahara before 20.10.5, 21.04.4, 21.10.2, and 22.04.0, a site using Isolated Institutions is vulnerable if more than ten groups are used. They are all shown from page 2 of the group results list (rather than only being shown for the institution that the viewer is a member of).

### CVSS Score: **5**
