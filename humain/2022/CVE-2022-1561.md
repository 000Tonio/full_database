# CVE-2022-1561

- Published: 2022-08-01T13:15:00

Lura and KrakenD-CE versions older than v2.0.2 and KrakenD-EE versions older than v2.0.0 do not sanitize URL parameters correctly, allowing a malicious user to alter the backend URL defined for a pipe when remote users send crafty URL requests. The vulnerability does not affect KrakenD itself, but the consumed backend might be vulnerable.
