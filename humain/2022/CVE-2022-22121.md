In NocoDB, versions 0.81.0 through 0.83.8 are affected by CSV Injection vulnerability (Formula Injection). A low privileged attacker can create a new table to inject payloads in the table rows. When an administrator accesses the User Management endpoint and exports the data as a CSV file and opens it, the payload gets executed.
