# CVE-2022-4707

- Published: 2023-01-10T17:15:00

- Modified: 2023-01-13T07:56:00

The Royal Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.3.59. This is due to missing nonce validation in the 'wpr_create_mega_menu_template' AJAX function. This allows unauthenticated attackers to create Mega Menu templates, granted they can trick an administrator into performing an action, such as clicking a link.

### CVSS Score: **null**
