# CVE-2022-1683

- Published: 2022-06-08T10:15:00

- Modified: 2022-06-15T16:12:00

The amtyThumb WordPress plugin through 4.2.0 does not sanitise and escape a parameter before using it in a SQL statement via its shortcode, leading to an SQL injection and is exploitable by any authenticated user (and not just Author+ like the original advisory mention) due to the fact that they can execute shortcodes via an AJAX action

### CVSS Score: **6.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
