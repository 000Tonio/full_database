# CVE-2022-1440

Command Injection vulnerability in git-interface@2.1.1 in GitHub repository yarkeev/git-interface prior to 2.1.2. If both are provided by user input, then the use of a `--upload-pack` command-line argument feature of git is also supported for `git clone`, which would then allow for any operating system command to be spawned by the attacker.
