In the Linux kernel before 6.1.6, a NULL pointer dereference bug in the traffic control subsystem allows an unprivileged user to trigger a denial of service (system crash) via a crafted traffic control configuration that is set up with "tc qdisc" and "tc class" commands. This affects qdisc_graft in net/sched/sch_api.c.
