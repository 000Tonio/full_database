The Simple Bitcoin Faucets WordPress plugin through 1.7.0 does not have any authorisation and CSRF in an AJAX action, allowing any authenticated users, such as subscribers to call it and add/delete/edit Bonds. Furthermore, due to the lack of sanitisation and escaping, it could also lead to Stored Cross-Site Scripting issues

### CVSS Score: **null**
