Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. A specially crafted `XAUTOCLAIM` command on a stream key in a specific state may result with heap overflow, and potentially remote code execution. This problem affects versions on the 7.x branch prior to 7.0.4. The patch is released in version 7.0.4.
