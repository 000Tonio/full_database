# CVE-2022-2590

- Published: 2022-08-31T16:15:00

A race condition was found in the way the Linux kernel's memory subsystem handled the copy-on-write (COW) breakage of private read-only shared memory mappings. This flaw allows an unprivileged, local user to gain write access to read-only memory mappings, increasing their privileges on the system.
