Nextcloud Server is the file server software for Nextcloud, a self-hosted productivity platform. In Nextcloud Server prior to versions 23.0.9 and 24.0.5 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server prior to versions 22.2.10.5, 23.0.9, and 24.0.5 an attacker reading `nextcloud.log` may gain knowledge of credentials to connect to a SharePoint service. Nextcloud Server versions 23.0.9 and 24.0.5 and Nextcloud Enterprise Server versions 22.2.10.5, 23.0.9, and 24.0.5 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, set `zend.exception_ignore_args = On` as an option in `php.ini`.
