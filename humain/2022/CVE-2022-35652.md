An open redirect issue was found in Moodle due to improper sanitization of user-supplied data in mobile auto-login feature. A remote attacker can create a link that leads to a trusted website, however, when clicked, it redirects the victims to arbitrary URL/domain. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to perform a phishing attack and steal potentially sensitive information.
