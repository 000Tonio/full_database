In CODESYS Gateway Server V2 an insufficient check for the activity of TCP client connections allows an unauthenticated attacker to consume all available TCP connections and prevent legitimate users or clients from establishing a new connection to the CODESYS Gateway Server V2. Existing connections are not affected and therefore remain intact.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
