# CVE-2022-4698

- Published: 2022-12-23T16:15:00

- Modified: 2022-12-30T17:09:00

The ProfilePress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several form fields in versions up to, and including, 4.5.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

### CVSS Score: **null**
