MeterSphere is a one-stop open source continuous testing platform, covering test management, interface testing, UI testing and performance testing. Versions prior to 2.5.1 allow users to upload a file, but do not validate the file name, which may lead to upload file to any path. The vulnerability has been fixed in v2.5.1. There are no workarounds.
