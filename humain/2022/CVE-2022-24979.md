# CVE-2022-24979

- Published: 2022-02-19T04:15:00

- Modified: 2022-03-07T16:52:00

An issue was discovered in the Varnishcache extension before 2.0.1 for TYPO3. The Edge Site Includes (ESI) content element renderer component does not include an access check. This allows an unauthenticated user to render various content elements, resulting in insecure direct object reference (IDOR), with the potential of exposing internal content elements.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
