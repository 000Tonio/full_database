# CVE-2022-31480

- Published: 2022-06-06T17:15:00

An unauthenticated attacker could arbitrarily upload firmware files to the target device, ultimately causing a Denial-of-Service (DoS). This vulnerability impacts products based on HID Mercury Intelligent Controllers LP1501, LP1502, LP2500, LP4502, and EP4502 which contain firmware versions prior to 1.302 for the LP series and 1.296 for the EP series. The attacker needs to have a properly signed and encrypted binary, loading the firmware to the device ultimately triggers a reboot.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
