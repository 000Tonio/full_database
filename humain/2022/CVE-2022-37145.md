The PlexTrac platform prior to version 1.17.0 does not restrict excessive authentication attempts for accounts configured to use the PlexTrac authentication provider. An unauthenticated remote attacker could perform a bruteforce attack on the login page with no time or attempt limitation in an attempt to obtain valid credentials for the platform users configured to use the PlexTrac authentication provider.
