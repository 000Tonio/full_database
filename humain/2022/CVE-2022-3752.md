An unauthorized user could use a specially crafted sequence of Ethernet/IP messages, combined with heavy traffic loading to cause a denial-of-service condition in Rockwell Automation Logix controllers resulting in a major non-recoverable fault. If the target device becomes unavailable, a user would have to clear the fault and redownload the user project file to bring the device back online and continue normal operation.
