# CVE-2022-32155

In universal forwarder versions before 9.0, management services are available remotely by default. When not required, it introduces a potential exposure, but it is not a vulnerability. If exposed, we recommend each customer assess the potential severity specific to your environment. In 9.0, the universal forwarder now binds the management port to localhost preventing remote logins by default. If management services are not required in versions before 9.0, set disableDefaultPort = true in server.conf OR allowRemoteLogin = never in server.conf OR mgmtHostPort = localhost in web.conf. See Configure universal forwarder management security (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.0.0/Security/EnableTLSCertHostnameValidation#Configure_universal_forwarder_management_security) for more information on disabling the remote management services.
