In Zinc, versions v0.1.9 through v0.3.1 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting when using the delete template functionality. When an authenticated user deletes a template with a XSS payload in the name field, the Javascript payload will be executed and allow an attacker to access the userâ€™s credentials.
