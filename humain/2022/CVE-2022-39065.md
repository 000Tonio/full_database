A single malformed IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee) frame makes the TRÅDFRI gateway unresponsive, such that connected lighting cannot be controlled with the IKEA Home Smart app and TRÅDFRI remote control. The malformed Zigbee frame is an unauthenticated broadcast message, which means all vulnerable devices within radio range are affected. CVSS 3.1 Base Score: 6.5 Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
