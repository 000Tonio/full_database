Mozilla developers Kershaw Chang, Ryan VanderMeulen, and Randell Jesup reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 97. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 98.
