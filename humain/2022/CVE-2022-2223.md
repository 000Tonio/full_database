The WordPress plugin Image Slider is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including 1.1.121 due to failure to properly check for the existence of a nonce in the function ewic_duplicate_slider. This make it possible for unauthenticated attackers to duplicate existing posts or pages granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
