Tabit - arbitrary SMS send on Tabits behalf. The resend OTP API of tabit allows an adversary to send messages on tabits behalf to anyone registered on the system - the API receives the parameters: phone number, and CustomMessage, We can use that API to craft malicious messages to any user of the system. In addition, the API probably has some kind of template injection potential. When entering {{OTP}} in the custom message field it is formatted into an OTP.
