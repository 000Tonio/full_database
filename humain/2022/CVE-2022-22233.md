An Unchecked Return Value to NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a locally authenticated attacker with low privileges to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). In Segment Routing (SR) to Label Distribution Protocol (LDP) interworking scenario, configured with Segment Routing Mapping Server (SRMS) at any node, when an Area Border Router (ABR) leaks the SRMS entries having "S" flag set from IS-IS Level 2 to Level 1, an rpd core might be observed when a specific low privileged CLI command is issued. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 21.4 versions prior to 21.4R1-S2, 21.4R2-S1, 21.4R3; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R2. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved 21.4-EVO versions prior to 21.4R1-S2-EVO, 21.4R2-S1-EVO, 21.4R3-EVO; 22.1-EVO versions prior to 22.1R2-EVO. This issue does not affect: Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 21.4R1. Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 21.4R1-EVO.
