EC-CUBE 3.0.0 to 3.0.18-p3 and EC-CUBE 4.0.0 to 4.1.1 improperly handle HTTP Host header values, which may lead a remote unauthenticated attacker to direct the vulnerable version of EC-CUBE to send an Email with some forged reissue-password URL to EC-CUBE users.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| --- | --- | --- |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
