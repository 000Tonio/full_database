# CVE-2022-38100

- Published: 2022-09-13T15:15:00

- Modified: 2022-09-14T22:48:00

The CMS800 device fails while attempting to parse malformed network data sent by a threat actor. A threat actor with network access can remotely issue a specially formatted UDP request that will cause the entire device to crash and require a physical reboot. A UDP broadcast request could be sent that causes a mass denial-of-service attack on all CME8000 devices connected to the same network.
