# CVE-2022-1122

- Published: 2022-03-29T18:15:00

A flaw was found in the opj2_decompress program in openjpeg2 2.4.0 in the way it handles an input directory with a large number of files. When it fails to allocate a buffer to store the filenames of the input directory, it calls free() on an uninitialized pointer, leading to a segmentation fault and a denial of service.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
