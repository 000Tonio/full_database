McAfee Enterprise ePolicy Orchestrator (ePO) prior to 5.10 Update 13 allows a local attacker to point an ePO server to an arbitrary SQL server during the restoration of the ePO server. To achieve this the attacker would have to be logged onto the server hosting the ePO server (restricted to administrators) and to know the SQL server password.
