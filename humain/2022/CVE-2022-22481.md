IBM Navigator for i 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4 (heritage version) could allow a remote attacker to obtain access to the web interface without valid credentials. By modifying the sign on request, an attacker can gain visibility to the fully qualified domain name of the target system and the navigator tasks page, however they do not gain the ability to perform those tasks on the system or see any specific system data. IBM X-Force ID: 225899.
