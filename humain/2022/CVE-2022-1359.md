The affected On-Premise cnMaestro is vulnerable to an arbitrary file-write through improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory inside a specific route. If an attacker supplied path traversal charters (../) as part of a filename, the server will save the file where the attacker chooses. This could allow an attacker to write any data to any file in the server.
