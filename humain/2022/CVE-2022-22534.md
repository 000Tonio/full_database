Due to insufficient encoding of user input, SAP NetWeaver allows an unauthenticated attacker to inject code that may expose sensitive data like user ID and password. These endpoints are normally exposed over the network and successful exploitation can partially impact confidentiality of the application.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
