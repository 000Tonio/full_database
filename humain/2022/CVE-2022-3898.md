The WP Affiliate Platform plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 6.3.9. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on various functions including the affiliates_menu method. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete affiliate records, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
