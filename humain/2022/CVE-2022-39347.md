FreeRDP is a free remote desktop protocol library and clients. Affected versions of FreeRDP are missing path canonicalization and base path check for `drive` channel. A malicious server can trick a FreeRDP based client to read files outside the shared directory. This issue has been addressed in version 2.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not use the `/drive`, `/drives` or `+home-drive` redirection switch.
