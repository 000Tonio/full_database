Databasir is a team-oriented relational database model document management platform. Databasir 1.01 has Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability. During the download verification process of a JDBC driver the corresponding JDBC driver download address will be downloaded first, but this address will return a response page with complete error information when accessing a non-existent URL. Attackers can take advantage of this feature for SSRF.
