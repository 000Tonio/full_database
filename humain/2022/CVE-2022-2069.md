The APDFL.dll in Siemens JT2Go prior to V13.3.0.5 and Siemens Teamcenter Visualization prior to V14.0.0.2 contains an out of bounds write past the fixed-length heap-based buffer while parsing specially crafted PDF files. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of the current process.
