A pair of spare WiFi credentials is stored in the configuration file of the Zyxel AX7501-B0 firmware prior to V5.17(ABPC.3)C0 in cleartext. An unauthenticated attacker could use the credentials to access the WLAN service if the configuration file has been retrieved from the device by leveraging another known vulnerability.
