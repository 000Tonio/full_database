An issue was discovered in Appalti & Contratti 9.12.2. The web applications are vulnerable to a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting issue. The idPagina parameter is reflected inside the server response without any HTML encoding, resulting in XSS when the victim moves the mouse pointer inside the page. As an example, the onmouseenter attribute is not sanitized.
