In "Gin-Vue-Admin", versions v2.5.1 through v2.5.3b are vulnerable to Unrestricted File Upload that leads to execution of javascript code, through the "Compress Upload" functionality to the Media Library. When an admin user views the uploaded file, a low privilege attacker will get access to the admin's cookie leading to account takeover.
