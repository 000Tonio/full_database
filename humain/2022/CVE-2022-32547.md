In ImageMagick, there is load of misaligned address for type 'double', which requires 8 byte alignment and for type 'float', which requires 4 byte alignment at MagickCore/property.c. Whenever crafted or untrusted input is processed by ImageMagick, this causes a negative impact to application availability or other problems related to undefined behavior.
