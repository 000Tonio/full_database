The auto-completion plugin in Ametys CMS before 4.5.0 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to read documents such as plugins/web/service/search/auto-completion/<domain>/en.xml (and similar pathnames for other languages), which contain all characters typed by all users, including the content of private pages. For example, a private page may contain usernames, e-mail addresses, and possibly passwords.
