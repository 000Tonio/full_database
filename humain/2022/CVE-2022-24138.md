IOBit Advanced System Care (Asc.exe) 15 and Action Download Center both download components of IOBit suite into ProgramData folder, ProgramData folder has "rwx" permissions for unprivileged users. Low privilege users can use SetOpLock to wait for CreateProcess and switch the genuine component with a malicious executable thus gaining code execution as a high privilege user (Low Privilege -> high integrity ADMIN).
