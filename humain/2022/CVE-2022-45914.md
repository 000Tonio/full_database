# CVE-2022-45914

- Published: 2022-11-27T01:15:00

- Modified: 2023-02-17T03:31:00

The ESL (Electronic Shelf Label) protocol, as implemented by (for example) the OV80e934802 RF transceiver on the ETAG-2130-V4.3 20190629 board, does not use authentication, which allows attackers to change label values via 433 MHz RF signals, as demonstrated by disrupting the organization of a hospital storage unit, or changing retail pricing.

### CVSS Score: **null**
