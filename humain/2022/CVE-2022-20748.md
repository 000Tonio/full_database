A vulnerability in the local malware analysis process of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on the affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient error handling in the local malware analysis process of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted file through the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the local malware analysis process to crash, which could result in a DoS condition. Notes: Manual intervention may be required to recover from this situation. Malware cloud lookup and dynamic analysis will not be impacted.
