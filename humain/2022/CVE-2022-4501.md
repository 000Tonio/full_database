# CVE-2022-4501

- Published: 2022-12-14T21:15:00

- Modified: 2022-12-20T14:26:00

The Mega Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on the vc_saving_data function in versions up to, and including, 4.2.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to update the plugin's settings.

### CVSS Score: **null**
