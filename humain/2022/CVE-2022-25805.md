An issue was discovered in the IGEL Universal Management Suite (UMS) 6.07.100. The transmission of cleartext LDAP bind credentials by the cmd_mgt_load_mgt_tree command allows an attacker (who can intercept or inspect traffic between an authenticated UMS client and server) to compromise those LDAP bind credentials.

### CVSS Score: **4**
