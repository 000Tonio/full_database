The 5 Stars Rating Funnel WordPress Plugin | RRatingg WordPress plugin before 1.2.54 does not properly sanitise, validate and escape lead ids before using them in a SQL statement via the rrtngg_delete_leads AJAX action, available to unauthenticated users, leading to an unauthenticated SQL injection issue. There is an attempt to sanitise the input, using sanitize_text_field(), however such function is not intended to prevent SQL injections.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |
