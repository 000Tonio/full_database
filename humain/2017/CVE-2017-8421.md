The function coff_set_alignment_hook in coffcode.h in Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, has a memory leak vulnerability which can cause memory exhaustion in objdump via a crafted PE file. Additional validation in dump_relocs_in_section in objdump.c can resolve this.
