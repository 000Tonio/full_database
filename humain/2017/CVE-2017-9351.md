# CVE-2017-9351

- Published: 2017-06-02T05:29:00

- Modified: 2019-03-20T13:24:00

In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.6 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.12, the DHCP dissector could read past the end of a buffer. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-bootp.c by extracting the Vendor Class Identifier more carefully.

### CVSS Score: **5**
