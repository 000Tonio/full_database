The Microsoft Windows embedded OpenType (EOT) font engine in Windows 7 SP1, Windows Server 2008 SP2 and 2008 R2 SP1, and Windows Server 2012 allows an attacker to potentially read data that was not intended to be disclosed, due to the way that the Microsoft Windows EOT font engine parses specially crafted embedded fonts, aka "Windows EOT Font Engine Information Disclosure Vulnerability." This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2017-11835.
