OneLogin Ruby-SAML 1.6.0 and earlier may incorrectly utilize the results of XML DOM traversal and canonicalization APIs in such a way that an attacker may be able to manipulate the SAML data without invalidating the cryptographic signature, allowing the attack to potentially bypass authentication to SAML service providers.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
