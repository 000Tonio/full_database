# CVE-2017-14681

- Published: 2017-09-21T23:29:00

The daemon in P3Scan 3.0_rc1 and earlier creates a p3scan.pid file after dropping privileges to a non-root account, which might allow local users to kill arbitrary processes by leveraging access to this non-root account for p3scan.pid modification before a root script executes a "kill `cat /pathname/p3scan.pid`" command, as demonstrated by etc/init.d/p3scan.
