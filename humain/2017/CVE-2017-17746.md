# CVE-2017-17746

- Published: 2017-12-20T20:29:00

Weak access control methods on the TP-Link TL-SG108E 1.0.0 allow any user on a NAT network with an authenticated administrator to access the device without entering user credentials. The authentication record is stored on the device; thus if an administrator authenticates from a NAT network, the authentication applies to the IP address of the NAT gateway, and any user behind that NAT gateway is also treated as authenticated.

### CVSS Score: **7.7**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
