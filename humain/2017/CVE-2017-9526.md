# CVE-2017-9526

- Published: 2017-06-11T02:29:00

- Modified: 2019-01-16T19:29:00

In Libgcrypt before 1.7.7, an attacker who learns the EdDSA session key (from side-channel observation during the signing process) can easily recover the long-term secret key. 1.7.7 makes a cipher/ecc-eddsa.c change to store this session key in secure memory, to ensure that constant-time point operations are used in the MPI library.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
