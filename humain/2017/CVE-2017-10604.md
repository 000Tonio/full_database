When the device is configured to perform account lockout with a defined period of time, any unauthenticated user attempting to log in as root with an incorrect password can trigger a lockout of the root account. When an SRX Series device is in cluster mode, and a cluster sync or failover operation occurs, then there will be errors associated with synch or failover while the root account is locked out. Administrators can confirm if the root account is locked out via the following command root@device> show system login lockout user root User Lockout start Lockout end root 1995-01-01 01:00:01 PDT 1995-11-01 01:31:01 PDT Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.1X46 prior to 12.1X46-D65 on SRX series; 12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D45 on SRX series; 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D75 on SRX series.
