In Cloud Foundry capi-release versions 1.33.0 and later, prior to 1.42.0 and cf-release versions 268 and later, prior to 274, the original fix for CVE-2017-8033 introduces an API regression that allows a space developer to execute arbitrary code on the Cloud Controller VM by pushing a specially crafted application. NOTE: 274 resolves the vulnerability but has a serious bug that is fixed in 275.
