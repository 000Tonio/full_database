The D-Link DIR-615 device before v20.12PTb04 doesn't use SSL for any of the authenticated pages. Also, it doesn't allow the user to generate his own SSL Certificate. An attacker can simply monitor network traffic to steal a user's credentials and/or credentials of users being added while sniffing the traffic.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
