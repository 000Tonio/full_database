In ABB SREA-01 revisions A, B, C: application versions up to 3.31.5, and SREA-50 revision A: application versions up to 3.32.8, an attacker may access internal files of ABB SREA-01 and SREA-50 legacy remote monitoring tools without any authorization over the network using a HTTP request which refers to files using ../../ relative paths. Once the internal password file is retrieved, the password hash can be identified using a brute force attack. There is also an exploit allowing running of commands after authorization.

### CVSS Score: **5**
