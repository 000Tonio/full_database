In Android before 2017-08-05 on Qualcomm MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, QRD Android, and all Android releases from CAF using the Linux kernel, if kernel memory address is passed from userspace through iris_vidioc_s_ext_ctrls ioctl, it will print kernel address data. A user could set it to an arbitrary kernel address, hence information disclosure (for kernel) could occur.
