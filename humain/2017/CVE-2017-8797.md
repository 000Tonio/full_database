# CVE-2017-8797

- Published: 2017-07-02T17:29:00

- Modified: 2023-02-03T02:02:00

The NFSv4 server in the Linux kernel before 4.11.3 does not properly validate the layout type when processing the NFSv4 pNFS GETDEVICEINFO or LAYOUTGET operand in a UDP packet from a remote attacker. This type value is uninitialized upon encountering certain error conditions. This value is used as an array index for dereferencing, which leads to an OOPS and eventually a DoS of knfsd and a soft-lockup of the whole system.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
