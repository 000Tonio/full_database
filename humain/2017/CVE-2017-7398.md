D-Link DIR-615 HW: T1 FW:20.09 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability. This enables an attacker to perform an unwanted action on a wireless router for which the user/admin is currently authenticated, as demonstrated by changing the Security option from WPA2 to None, or changing the hiddenSSID parameter, SSID parameter, or a security-option password.
