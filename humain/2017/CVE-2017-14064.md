# CVE-2017-14064

- Published: 2017-08-31T17:29:00

Ruby through 2.2.7, 2.3.x through 2.3.4, and 2.4.x through 2.4.1 can expose arbitrary memory during a JSON.generate call. The issues lies in using strdup in ext/json/ext/generator/generator.c, which will stop after encountering a '\0' byte, returning a pointer to a string of length zero, which is not the length stored in space_len.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**
