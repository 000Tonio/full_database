# CVE-2017-17662

- Published: 2018-01-10T18:29:00

Directory traversal in the HTTP server on Yawcam 0.2.6 through 0.6.0 devices allows attackers to read arbitrary files through a sequence of the form '.x./' or '....\x/' where x is a pattern composed of one or more (zero or more for the second pattern) of either \ or ..\ -- for example a '.\./', '....\/' or '...\./' sequence. For files with no extension, a single dot needs to be appended to ensure the HTTP server does not alter the request, e.g., a "GET /.\./.\./.\./.\./.\./.\./.\./windows/system32/drivers/etc/hosts." request.
