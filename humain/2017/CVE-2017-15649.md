# CVE-2017-15649

net/packet/af_packet.c in the Linux kernel before 4.13.6 allows local users to gain privileges via crafted system calls that trigger mishandling of packet_fanout data structures, because of a race condition (involving fanout_add and packet_do_bind) that leads to a use-after-free, a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-6346.
