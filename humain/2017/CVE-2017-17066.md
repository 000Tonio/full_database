The (1) i2pd before 2.17 and (2) kovri pre-alpha implementations of the I2P routing protocol do not properly handle Garlic DeliveryTypeTunnel packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer over-read, as demonstrated by reading sensitive router memory, aka the GarlicRust bug.

### CVSS Score: **5**
