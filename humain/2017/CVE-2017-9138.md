There is a debug-interface vulnerability on some Tenda routers (FH1202/F1202/F1200: versions before 1.2.0.20). After connecting locally to a router in a wired or wireless manner, one can bypass intended access restrictions by sending shell commands directly and reading their results, or by entering shell commands that change this router's username and password.
