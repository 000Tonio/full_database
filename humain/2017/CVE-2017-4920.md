The implementation of the OSPF protocol in VMware NSX-V Edge 6.2.x prior to 6.2.8 and NSX-V Edge 6.3.x prior to 6.3.3 doesn't correctly handle the link-state advertisement (LSA). A rogue LSA may exploit this issue resulting in continuous sending of LSAs between two routers eventually going in loop or loss of connectivity.
