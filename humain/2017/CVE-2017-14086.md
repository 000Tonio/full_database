Pre-authorization Start Remote Process vulnerabilities in Trend Micro OfficeScan 11.0 and XG may allow unauthenticated users who can access the OfficeScan server to start the fcgiOfcDDA.exe executable or cause a potential INI corruption, which may cause the server disk space to be consumed with dump files from continuous HTTP requests.
