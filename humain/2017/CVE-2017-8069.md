drivers/net/usb/rtl8150.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x before 4.9.11 interacts incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash or memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of more than one virtual page for a DMA scatterlist.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
