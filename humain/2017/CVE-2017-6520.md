The Multicast DNS (mDNS) responder used in BOSE Soundtouch 30 inadvertently responds to IPv4 unicast queries with source addresses that are not link-local, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (traffic amplification) or obtain potentially sensitive information via port-5353 UDP packets.
