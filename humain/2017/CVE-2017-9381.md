# CVE-2017-9381

An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides a user with the capability of installing or deleting apps on the device using the web management interface. It seems that the device does not implement any cross-site request forgery protection mechanism which allows an attacker to trick a user who navigates to an attacker controlled page to install or delete an application on the device. Note: The cross-site request forgery is a systemic issue across all other functionalities of the device.
