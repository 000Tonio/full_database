# CVE-2017-8794

- Published: 2017-05-05T18:29:00

- Modified: 2017-05-17T16:54:00

An issue was discovered on Accellion FTA devices before FTA_9_12_180. Because a regular expression (intended to match local https URLs) lacks an initial ^ character, courier/web/1000@/wmProgressval.html allows SSRF attacks with a file:///etc/passwd#https:// URL pattern.
