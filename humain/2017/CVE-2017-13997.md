A Missing Authentication for Critical Function issue was discovered in Schneider Electric InduSoft Web Studio v8.0 SP2 or prior, and InTouch Machine Edition v8.0 SP2 or prior. InduSoft Web Studio provides the capability for an HMI client to trigger script execution on the server for the purposes of performing customized calculations or actions. A remote malicious entity could bypass the server authentication and trigger the execution of an arbitrary command. The command is executed under high privileges and could lead to a complete compromise of the server.

### CVSS Score: **10**
