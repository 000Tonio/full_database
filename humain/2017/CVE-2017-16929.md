The remote management interface on the Claymore Dual GPU miner 10.1 is vulnerable to an authenticated directory traversal vulnerability exploited by issuing a specially crafted request, allowing a remote attacker to read/write arbitrary files. This can be exploited via ../ sequences in the pathname to miner_file or miner_getfile.

### CVSS Score: **8.5**

| --- | --- | --- |
