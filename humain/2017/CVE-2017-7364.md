In all Qualcomm products with Android releases from CAF using the Linux kernel, in function __mdss_fb_copy_destscaler_data(), variable ds_data[i].scale may still point to a user-provided address (which could point to arbitrary kernel address), so on an error condition, this user-provided address will be freed (arbitrary free), and continued operation could result in use after free condition.
