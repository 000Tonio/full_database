Arbitrary file upload vulnerability in com/dotmarketing/servlets/AjaxFileUploadServlet.class in dotCMS 4.1.1 allows remote authenticated administrators to upload .jsp files to arbitrary locations via directory traversal sequences in the fieldName parameter to servlets/ajax_file_upload. This results in arbitrary code execution by requesting the .jsp file at a /assets URI.
