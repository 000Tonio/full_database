# CVE-2017-18222

In the Linux kernel before 4.12, Hisilicon Network Subsystem (HNS) does not consider the ETH_SS_PRIV_FLAGS case when retrieving sset_count data, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact, as demonstrated by incompatibility between hns_get_sset_count and ethtool_get_strings.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
