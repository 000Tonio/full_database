# CVE-2017-8061

- Published: 2017-04-23T05:59:00

- Modified: 2017-04-27T19:05:00

drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/dvb-usb-firmware.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x and 4.10.x before 4.10.7 interacts incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash or memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of more than one virtual page for a DMA scatterlist.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
