In all android releases(Android for MSM, Firefox OS for MSM, QRD Android) from CAF using the linux kernel, Userspace can pass IEs to the host driver and if multiple append commands are received, then the integer variable that stores the length can overflow and the subsequent copy of the IE data may potentially lead to a heap buffer overflow.
