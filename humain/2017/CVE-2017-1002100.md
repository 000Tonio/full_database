Default access permissions for Persistent Volumes (PVs) created by the Kubernetes Azure cloud provider in versions 1.6.0 to 1.6.5 are set to "container" which exposes a URI that can be accessed without authentication on the public internet. Access to the URI string requires privileged access to the Kubernetes cluster or authenticated access to the Azure portal.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
