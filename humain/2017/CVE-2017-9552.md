# CVE-2017-9552

A design flaw in authentication in Synology Photo Station 6.0-2528 through 6.7.1-3419 allows local users to obtain credentials via cmdline. Synology Photo Station employs the synophoto_dsm_user program to authenticate username and password by "synophoto_dsm_user --auth USERNAME PASSWORD", and local users are able to obtain credentials by sniffing "/proc/*/cmdline".

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
