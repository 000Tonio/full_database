# CVE-2017-11465

The parser_yyerror function in the UTF-8 parser in Ruby 2.4.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid write or read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted Ruby script, related to the parser_tokadd_utf8 function in parse.y. NOTE: this might have security relevance as a bypass of a $SAFE protection mechanism.
