# CVE-2017-8038

- Published: 2017-11-27T10:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-03T00:03:00

In Cloud Foundry Foundation Credhub-release version 1.1.0, access control lists (ACLs) enforce whether an authenticated user can perform an operation on a credential. For installations using ACLs, the ACL was bypassed for the CredHub interpolate endpoint, allowing authenticated applications to view any credential within the CredHub installation.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
