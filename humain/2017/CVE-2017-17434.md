# CVE-2017-17434

- Published: 2017-12-06T03:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-03T00:03:00

The daemon in rsync 3.1.2, and 3.1.3-development before 2017-12-03, does not check for fnamecmp filenames in the daemon_filter_list data structure (in the recv_files function in receiver.c) and also does not apply the sanitize_paths protection mechanism to pathnames found in "xname follows" strings (in the read_ndx_and_attrs function in rsync.c), which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
