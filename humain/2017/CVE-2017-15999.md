In the "NQ Contacts Backup & Restore" application 1.1 for Android, no HTTPS is used for transmitting login and synced user data. When logging in, the username is transmitted in cleartext along with an SHA-1 hash of the password. The attacker can either crack this hash or use it for further attacks where only the hash value is required.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
