An incorrect implementation of "XEP-0280: Message Carbons" in multiple XMPP clients allows a remote attacker to impersonate any user, including contacts, in the vulnerable application's display. This allows for various kinds of social engineering attacks. This CVE is for Xabber (only if manually enabled: 1.0.30, 1.0.30 VIP, beta 1.0.3 - 1.0.74; Android).
