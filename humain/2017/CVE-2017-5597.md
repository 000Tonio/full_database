# CVE-2017-5597

- Published: 2017-01-25T21:59:00

- Modified: 2017-11-04T01:29:00

In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.3 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.9, the DHCPv6 dissector could go into a large loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-dhcpv6.c by changing a data type to avoid an integer overflow.

### CVSS Score: **5**
