Memory Corruption Privilege Escalation vulnerabilities in Trend Micro OfficeScan 11.0 and XG allows local attackers to execute arbitrary code and escalate privileges to resources normally reserved for the kernel on vulnerable installations by exploiting tmwfp.sys. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit the vulnerability.
