Race condition in kernel/events/core.c in the Linux kernel before 4.9.7 allows local users to gain privileges via a crafted application that makes concurrent perf_event_open system calls for moving a software group into a hardware context.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-6786.
