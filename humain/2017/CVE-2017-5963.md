An issue was discovered in caddy (for TYPO3) before 7.2.10. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in the "paymillToken" HTTP POST parameter passed to the "caddy/Resources/Public/JavaScript/e-payment/paymill/api/php/payment.php" URL. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of the vulnerable website.
