# CVE-2017-5551

- Published: 2017-02-06T06:59:00

- Modified: 2019-10-03T00:03:00

The simple_set_acl function in fs/posix_acl.c in the Linux kernel before 4.9.6 preserves the setgid bit during a setxattr call involving a tmpfs filesystem, which allows local users to gain group privileges by leveraging the existence of a setgid program with restrictions on execute permissions.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-7097.
