Tenable Nessus before 6.10.2 (as used alone or in Tenable Appliance before 4.5.0) was found to contain a flaw that allowed a remote, authenticated attacker to upload a crafted file that could be written to anywhere on the system. This could be used to subsequently gain elevated privileges on the system (e.g., after a reboot). This issue only affects installations on Windows.
