The rend_service_intro_established function in or/rendservice.c in Tor before 0.2.8.15, 0.2.9.x before 0.2.9.12, 0.3.0.x before 0.3.0.11, 0.3.1.x before 0.3.1.7, and 0.3.2.x before 0.3.2.1-alpha, when SafeLogging is disabled, allows attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging access to the log files of a hidden service, because uninitialized stack data is included in an error message about construction of an introduction point circuit.
