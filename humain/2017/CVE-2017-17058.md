** DISPUTED ** The WooCommerce plugin through 3.x for WordPress has a Directory Traversal Vulnerability via a /wp-content/plugins/woocommerce/templates/emails/plain/ URI, which accesses a parent directory. NOTE: a software maintainer indicates that Directory Traversal is not possible because all of the template files have "if (!defined('ABSPATH')) {exit;}" code.
