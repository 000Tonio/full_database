The Juniper Enhanced jdhcpd daemon may experience high CPU utilization, or crash and restart upon receipt of an invalid IPv6 UDP packet. Both high CPU utilization and repeated crashes of the jdhcpd daemon can result in a denial of service as DHCP service is interrupted. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 14.1X53 prior to 14.1X53-D12, 14.1X53-D38, 14.1X53-D40 on QFX, EX, QFabric System; 15.1 prior to 15.1F2-S18, 15.1R4 on all products and platforms; 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D80 on SRX; 15.1X53 prior to 15.1X53-D51, 15.1X53-D60 on NFX, QFX, EX.
