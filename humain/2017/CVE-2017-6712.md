A vulnerability in certain commands of Cisco Elastic Services Controller could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to elevate privileges to root and run dangerous commands on the server. The vulnerability occurs because a "tomcat" user on the system can run certain shell commands, allowing the user to overwrite any file on the filesystem and elevate privileges to root. This vulnerability affects Cisco Elastic Services Controller prior to releases 2.3.1.434 and 2.3.2. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvc76634.
