VMware Workstation and Fusion contain an integer overflow vulnerability in VMware NAT service when IPv6 mode is enabled. This issue may lead to an out-of-bound read which can then be used to execute code on the host in conjunction with other issues. Note: IPv6 mode for VMNAT is not enabled by default.
