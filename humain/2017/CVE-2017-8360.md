# CVE-2017-8360

- Published: 2017-05-12T07:29:00

Conexant Systems mictray64 task, as used on HP Elite, EliteBook, ProBook, and ZBook systems, leaks sensitive data (keystrokes) to any process. In mictray64.exe (mic tray icon) 1.0.0.46, a LowLevelKeyboardProc Windows hook is used to capture keystrokes. This data is leaked via unintended channels: debug messages accessible to any process that is running in the current user session, and filesystem access to C:\Users\Public\MicTray.log by any process.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
