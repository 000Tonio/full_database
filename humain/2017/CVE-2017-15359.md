In the 3CX Phone System 15.5.3554.1, the Management Console typically listens to port 5001 and is prone to a directory traversal attack: "/api/RecordingList/DownloadRecord?file=" and "/api/SupportInfo?file=" are the vulnerable parameters. An attacker must be authenticated to exploit this issue to access sensitive information to aid in subsequent attacks.
