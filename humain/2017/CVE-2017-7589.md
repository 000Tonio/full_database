# CVE-2017-7589

In OpenIDM through 4.0.0 before 4.5.0, the info endpoint may leak sensitive information upon a request by the "anonymous" user, as demonstrated by responses with a 200 HTTP status code and a JSON object containing IP address strings. This is related to a missing access-control check in bin/defaults/script/info/login.js.
