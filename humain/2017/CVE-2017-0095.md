Hyper-V in Microsoft Windows 10 Gold, 1511, and 1607 and Windows Server 2016 does not properly validate vSMB packet data, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on a target OS, aka "Hyper-V vSMB Remote Code Execution Vulnerability." This vulnerability is different from that described in CVE-2017-0021.
