It was found that a mock CMC authentication plugin with a hardcoded secret was accidentally enabled by default in the pki-core package before 10.6.4. An attacker could potentially use this flaw to bypass the regular authentication process and trick the CA server into issuing certificates.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
