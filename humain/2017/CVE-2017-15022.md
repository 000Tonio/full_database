dwarf2.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29, does not validate the DW_AT_name data type, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (bfd_hash_hash NULL pointer dereference, or out-of-bounds access, and application crash) via a crafted ELF file, related to scan_unit_for_symbols and parse_comp_unit.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
