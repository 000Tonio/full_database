Amazon Key through 2017-11-16 mishandles Cloud Cam 802.11 deauthentication frames during the delivery process, which makes it easier for (1) delivery drivers to freeze a camera and re-enter a house for unfilmed activities or (2) attackers to freeze a camera and enter a house if a delivery driver failed to ensure a locked door before leaving.

### CVSS Score: **3.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
