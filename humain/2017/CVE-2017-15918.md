Sera 1.2 stores the user's login password in plain text in their home directory. This makes privilege escalation trivial and also exposes the user and system keychains to local attacks.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
