- Published: 2017-11-24T07:29:00

The web server on DBL DBLTek devices allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands by obtaining the admin password via a frame.html?content=/dev/mtdblock/5 request, and then using this password for the HTTP Basic Authentication needed for a change_password.csp request, which supports a "<%%25call system.exec:" string in the passwd parameter.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
