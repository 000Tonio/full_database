MEDHOST Connex contains a hard-coded Mirth Connect admin credential that is used for customer Mirth Connect management access. An attacker with knowledge of the hard-coded credential and the ability to communicate directly with the Mirth Connect management console may be able to intercept sensitive patient information. The admin account password is hard-coded as $K8t1ng throughout the application, and is the same across all installations. Customers do not have the option to change the Mirth Connect admin account password. The Mirth Connect admin account is created during the Connex install. The plaintext account password is hard-coded multiple times in the Connex install and update scripts.
