Nagios Core before 4.3.3 creates a nagios.lock PID file after dropping privileges to a non-root account, which might allow local users to kill arbitrary processes by leveraging access to this non-root account for nagios.lock modification before a root script executes a "kill `cat /pathname/nagios.lock`" command.

### CVSS Score: **6.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
