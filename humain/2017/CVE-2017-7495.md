fs/ext4/inode.c in the Linux kernel before 4.6.2, when ext4 data=ordered mode is used, mishandles a needs-flushing-before-commit list, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from other users' files in opportunistic circumstances by waiting for a hardware reset, creating a new file, making write system calls, and reading this file.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
