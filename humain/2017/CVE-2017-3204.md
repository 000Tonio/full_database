# CVE-2017-3204

- Published: 2017-04-04T14:59:00

- Modified: 2020-07-07T18:21:00

The Go SSH library (x/crypto/ssh) by default does not verify host keys, facilitating man-in-the-middle attacks. Default behavior changed in commit e4e2799 to require explicitly registering a hostkey verification mechanism.
