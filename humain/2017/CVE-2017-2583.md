The load_segment_descriptor implementation in arch/x86/kvm/emulate.c in the Linux kernel before 4.9.5 improperly emulates a "MOV SS, NULL selector" instruction, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) or gain guest OS privileges via a crafted application.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |
