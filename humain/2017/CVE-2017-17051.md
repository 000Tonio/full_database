# CVE-2017-17051

- Published: 2017-12-05T18:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-03T00:03:00

An issue was discovered in the default FilterScheduler in OpenStack Nova 16.0.3. By repeatedly rebuilding an instance with new images, an authenticated user may consume untracked resources on a hypervisor host leading to a denial of service, aka doubled resource allocations. This regression was introduced with the fix for OSSA-2017-005 (CVE-2017-16239); however, only Nova stable/pike or later deployments with that fix applied and relying on the default FilterScheduler are affected.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
