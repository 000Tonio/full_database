# CVE-2017-13686

- Published: 2017-08-24T22:29:00

- Modified: 2017-08-30T01:16:00

net/ipv4/route.c in the Linux kernel 4.13-rc1 through 4.13-rc6 is too late to check for a NULL fi field when RTM_F_FIB_MATCH is set, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls. NOTE: this does not affect any stable release.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
