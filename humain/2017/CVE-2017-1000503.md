A race condition during Jenkins 2.81 through 2.94 (inclusive); 2.89.1 startup could result in the wrong order of execution of commands during initialization. This could in rare cases result in failure to initialize the setup wizard on the first startup. This resulted in multiple security-related settings not being set to their usual strict default.
