# CVE-2017-17484

- Published: 2017-12-10T20:29:00

The ucnv_UTF8FromUTF8 function in ucnv_u8.cpp in International Components for Unicode (ICU) for C/C++ through 60.1 mishandles ucnv_convertEx calls for UTF-8 to UTF-8 conversion, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted string, as demonstrated by ZNC.
