# CVE-2017-5255

- Published: 2017-12-20T22:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-09T23:28:00

In version 3.5 and prior of Cambium Networks ePMP firmware, a lack of input sanitation for certain parameters on the web management console allows any authenticated user (including the otherwise low-privilege readonly user) to inject shell meta-characters as part of a specially-crafted POST request to the get_chart function and run OS-level commands, effectively as root.

### CVSS Score: **9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
