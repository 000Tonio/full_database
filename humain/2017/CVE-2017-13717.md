Starry Station (aka Starry Router) sets the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header to "*". This allows any hosted file on any domain to make calls to the device's webserver and brute force the credentials and pull any information that is stored on the device. In this case, a user's Wi-Fi credentials are stored in clear text on the device and can be pulled easily.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
