# CVE-2017-5669

- Published: 2017-02-24T15:59:00

- Modified: 2020-10-09T14:49:00

The do_shmat function in ipc/shm.c in the Linux kernel through 4.9.12 does not restrict the address calculated by a certain rounding operation, which allows local users to map page zero, and consequently bypass a protection mechanism that exists for the mmap system call, by making crafted shmget and shmat system calls in a privileged context.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
