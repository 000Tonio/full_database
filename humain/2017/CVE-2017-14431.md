Memory leak in Xen 3.3 through 4.8.x allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (ARM or x86 AMD host OS memory consumption) by continually rebooting, because certain cleanup is skipped if no pass-through device was ever assigned, aka XSA-207.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
