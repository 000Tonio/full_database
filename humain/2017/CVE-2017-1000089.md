Builds in Jenkins are associated with an authentication that controls the permissions that the build has to interact with other elements in Jenkins. The Pipeline: Build Step Plugin did not check the build authentication it was running as and allowed triggering any other project in Jenkins.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
