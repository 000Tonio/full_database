There are CSRF vulnerabilities in Subrion CMS 4.1.x through 4.1.5, and before 4.2.0, because of a logic error. Although there is functionality to detect CSRF, it is called too late in the ia.core.php code, allowing (for example) an attack against the query parameter to panel/database.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
