# CVE-2017-6062

- Published: 2017-03-02T06:59:00

- Modified: 2019-10-25T19:15:00

The "OpenID Connect Relying Party and OAuth 2.0 Resource Server" (aka mod_auth_openidc) module before 2.1.5 for the Apache HTTP Server does not skip OIDC_CLAIM_ and OIDCAuthNHeader headers in an "OIDCUnAuthAction pass" configuration, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via crafted HTTP traffic.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
