# CVE-2017-6347

- Published: 2017-03-01T20:59:00

- Modified: 2023-02-10T00:53:00

The ip_cmsg_recv_checksum function in net/ipv4/ip_sockglue.c in the Linux kernel before 4.10.1 has incorrect expectations about skb data layout, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls, as demonstrated by use of the MSG_MORE flag in conjunction with loopback UDP transmission.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
