Heap-based buffer overflow in drivers/net/macsec.c in the MACsec module in the Linux kernel through 4.10.12 allows attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging the use of a MAX_SKB_FRAGS+1 size in conjunction with the NETIF_F_FRAGLIST feature, leading to an error in the skb_to_sgvec function.
