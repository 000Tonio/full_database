Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in aggregate_graphs.php in Cacti before 1.1.16 allows remote authenticated users to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via specially crafted HTTP Referer headers, related to the $cancel_url variable. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix (lack of the htmlspecialchars ENT_QUOTES flag) for CVE-2017-11163.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
