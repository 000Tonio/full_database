# CVE-2017-18235

- Published: 2018-03-15T19:29:00

- Modified: 2018-04-04T17:48:00

An issue was discovered in Exempi before 2.4.3. The VPXChunk class in XMPFiles/source/FormatSupport/WEBP_Support.cpp does not ensure nonzero widths and heights, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and application exit) via a crafted .webp file.
