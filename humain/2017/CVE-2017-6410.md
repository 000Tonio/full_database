kpac/script.cpp in KDE kio before 5.32 and kdelibs before 4.14.30 calls the PAC FindProxyForURL function with a full https URL (potentially including Basic Authentication credentials, a query string, or PATH_INFO), which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a crafted PAC file.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| --- | --- | --- |
