It was discovered that an issue in the session logic in Unitrends Backup (UB) before 10.0.0 allowed using the LOGDIR environment variable during a web session to elevate an existing low-privilege user to root privileges. A remote attacker with existing low-privilege credentials could then execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.

### CVSS Score: **9**
