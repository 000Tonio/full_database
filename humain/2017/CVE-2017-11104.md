- Published: 2017-07-08T10:29:00

- Modified: 2023-01-20T15:23:00

Knot DNS before 2.4.5 and 2.5.x before 2.5.2 contains a flaw within the TSIG protocol implementation that would allow an attacker with a valid key name and algorithm to bypass TSIG authentication if no additional ACL restrictions are set, because of an improper TSIG validity period check.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
