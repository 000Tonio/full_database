Leptonica 1.74.4 constructs unintended pathnames (containing duplicated path components) when operating on files in /tmp subdirectories, which might allow local users to bypass intended file restrictions by leveraging access to a directory located deeper within the /tmp directory tree, as demonstrated by /tmp/ANY/PATH/ANY/PATH/input.tif.
