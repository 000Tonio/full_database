The III_i_stereo function in layer3.c in mpglib, as used in libmpgdecoder.a in LAME 3.99.5 and other products, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read and application crash) via a crafted audio file that is mishandled in the code for the "block_type == 2" case, a similar issue to CVE-2017-11126.
