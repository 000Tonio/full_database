# CVE-2017-6379

- Published: 2017-03-16T14:59:00

Some administrative paths in Drupal 8.2.x before 8.2.7 did not include protection for CSRF. This would allow an attacker to disable some blocks on a site. This issue is mitigated by the fact that users would have to know the block ID.

### CVSS Score: **5.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
