Apache Portable Runtime Utility (APR-util) 1.6.0 and prior fail to validate the integrity of SDBM database files used by apr_sdbm*() functions, resulting in a possible out of bound read access. A local user with write access to the database can make a program or process using these functions crash, and cause a denial of service.
