Some Huawei products RSE6500 V500R002C00; SoftCo V200R003C20SPCb00; VP9660 V600R006C10; eSpace U1981 V100R001C20; V200R003C20; V200R003C30; V200R003C50 have a weak algorithm vulnerability. To exploit the vulnerability, a remote, unauthenticated attacker has to capture TLS traffic between clients and the affected products. The attacker may launch the Bleichenbacher attack on RSA key exchange to decrypt the session key and the previously captured sessions by some cryptanalytic operations. Successful exploit may cause information leak.
