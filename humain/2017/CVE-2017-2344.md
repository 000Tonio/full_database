# CVE-2017-2344

A routine within an internal Junos OS sockets library is vulnerable to a buffer overflow. Malicious exploitation of this issue may lead to a denial of service (kernel panic) or be leveraged as a privilege escalation through local code execution. The routines are only accessible via programs running on the device itself, and veriexec restricts arbitrary programs from running on Junos OS. There are no known exploit vectors utilizing signed binaries shipped with Junos OS itself. Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.1X46 prior to 12.1X46-D67; 12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D51, 12.3X48-D55; 13.3 prior to 13.3R10-S2; 14.1 prior to 14.1R2-S10, 14.1R8-S4, 14.1R9; 14.1X50 prior to 14.1X50-D185; 14.1X53 prior to 14.1X53-D122, 14.1X53-D45, 14.1X53-D50; 14.2 prior to 14.2R4-S9, 14.2R7-S7, 14.2R8; 15.1 prior to 15.1F2-S18, 15.1F6-S7, 15.1R4-S8, 15.1R5-S5, 15.1R6-S1, 15.1R7; 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D100; 15.1X53 prior to 15.1X53-D231, 15.1X53-D47, 15.1X53-D48, 15.1X53-D57, 15.1X53-D64, 15.1X53-D70; 16.1 prior to 16.1R3-S4, 16.1R4-S3, 16.1R4-S4, 16.1R5; 16.2 prior to 16.2R2; 17.1 prior to 17.1R1-S3, 17.1R2; 17.2 prior to 17.2R1-S1, 17.2R2; 17.2X75 prior to 17.2X75-D30. No other Juniper Networks products or platforms are affected by this issue.
