Zend/zend_hash.c in PHP before 7.0.15 and 7.1.x before 7.1.1 mishandles certain cases that require large array allocations, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (integer overflow, uninitialized memory access, and use of arbitrary destructor function pointers) via crafted serialized data.
