drivers/media/usb/dvb-usb/cxusb.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x and 4.10.x before 4.10.12 interacts incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of more than one virtual page for a DMA scatterlist.
