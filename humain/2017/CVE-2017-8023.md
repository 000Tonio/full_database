EMC NetWorker may potentially be vulnerable to an unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability in the Networker Client execution service (nsrexecd) when oldauth authentication method is used. An unauthenticated remote attacker could send arbitrary commands via RPC service to be executed on the host system with the privileges of the nsrexecd service, which runs with administrative privileges.
