# CVE-2017-14177

- Published: 2018-02-02T14:29:00

- Modified: 2018-02-15T13:20:00

Apport through 2.20.7 does not properly handle core dumps from setuid binaries allowing local users to create certain files as root which an attacker could leverage to perform a denial of service via resource exhaustion or possibly gain root privileges.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2015-1324.
