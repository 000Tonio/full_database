WP1StylesListener.cpp, WP5StylesListener.cpp, and WP42StylesListener.cpp in libwpd 0.10.1 mishandle iterators, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read in the WPXTableList class in WPXTable.cpp). This vulnerability can be triggered in LibreOffice before 5.3.7. It may lead to suffering a remote attack against a LibreOffice application.
