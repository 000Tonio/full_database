# CVE-2017-15274

- Published: 2017-10-12T00:29:00

- Modified: 2018-03-16T01:29:00

security/keys/keyctl.c in the Linux kernel before 4.11.5 does not consider the case of a NULL payload in conjunction with a nonzero length value, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) via a crafted add_key or keyctl system call, a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-12192.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
