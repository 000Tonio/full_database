# CVE-2017-9001

Aruba ClearPass 6.6.3 and later includes a feature called "SSH Lockout", which causes ClearPass to lock accounts with too many login failures through SSH. When this feature is enabled, an unauthenticated remote command execution vulnerability is present which could allow an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with "root" privilege level. This vulnerability is only present when a specific feature has been enabled. The SSH Lockout feature is not enabled by default, so only systems which have enabled this feature are vulnerable.
