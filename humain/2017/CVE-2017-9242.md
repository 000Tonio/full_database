- Published: 2017-05-27T01:29:00

- Modified: 2018-01-05T02:31:00

The __ip6_append_data function in net/ipv6/ip6_output.c in the Linux kernel through 4.11.3 is too late in checking whether an overwrite of an skb data structure may occur, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash) via crafted system calls.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
