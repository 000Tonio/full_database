Quick Emulator (Qemu) built with the VirtFS, host directory sharing via Plan 9 File System (9pfs) support, is vulnerable to an improper access control issue. It could occur while accessing files on a shared host directory. A privileged user inside guest could use this flaw to access host file system beyond the shared folder and potentially escalating their privileges on a host.
