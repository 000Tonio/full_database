# CVE-2017-16930

- Published: 2017-12-05T09:29:00

The remote management interface on the Claymore Dual GPU miner 10.1 allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code due to a stack-based buffer overflow in the request handler. This can be exploited via a long API request that is mishandled during logging.

### CVSS Score: **10**
