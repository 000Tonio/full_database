- Published: 2017-04-23T05:59:00

- Modified: 2017-04-27T16:51:00

drivers/net/usb/pegasus.c in the Linux kernel 4.9.x before 4.9.11 interacts incorrectly with the CONFIG_VMAP_STACK option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system crash or memory corruption) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging use of more than one virtual page for a DMA scatterlist.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
