Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues were discovered in INTER-Mediator 5.5. The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data (c and cred) passed to the "INTER-Mediator-master/Auth_Support/PasswordReset/resetpassword.php" URL. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of the vulnerable website.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
