Race condition in kernel/ucount.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.2 allows local users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free and system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted system calls that leverage certain decrement behavior that causes incorrect interaction between put_ucounts and get_ucounts.
