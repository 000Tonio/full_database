# CVE-2017-7272

- Published: 2017-03-27T17:59:00

- Modified: 2018-02-26T02:29:00

PHP through 7.1.11 enables potential SSRF in applications that accept an fsockopen or pfsockopen hostname argument with an expectation that the port number is constrained. Because a :port syntax is recognized, fsockopen will use the port number that is specified in the hostname argument, instead of the port number in the second argument of the function.

### CVSS Score: **5.8**
