# CVE-2017-17862

- Published: 2017-12-27T17:08:00

- Modified: 2018-04-07T01:29:00

kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel through 4.14.8 ignores unreachable code, even though it would still be processed by JIT compilers. This behavior, also considered an improper branch-pruning logic issue, could possibly be used by local users for denial of service.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
