OpenEMR before 5.0.0 Patch 5 allows unauthenticated remote database copying because setup.php exposes functionality for cloning an existing OpenEMR site to an arbitrary attacker-controlled MySQL server via vectors involving a crafted state parameter.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
