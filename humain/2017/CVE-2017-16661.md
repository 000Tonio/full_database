Cacti 1.1.27 allows remote authenticated administrators to read arbitrary files by placing the Log Path into a private directory, and then making a clog.php?filename= request, as demonstrated by filename=passwd (with a Log Path under /etc) to read /etc/passwd.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
