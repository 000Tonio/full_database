A query with a specific set of characteristics could cause a server using DNS64 to encounter an assertion failure and terminate. An attacker could deliberately construct a query, enabling denial-of-service against a server if it was configured to use the DNS64 feature and other preconditions were met. Affects BIND 9.8.0 -> 9.8.8-P1, 9.9.0 -> 9.9.9-P6, 9.9.10b1->9.9.10rc1, 9.10.0 -> 9.10.4-P6, 9.10.5b1->9.10.5rc1, 9.11.0 -> 9.11.0-P3, 9.11.1b1->9.11.1rc1, 9.9.3-S1 -> 9.9.9-S8.
