In Lenovo XClarity Administrator (LXCA) before 1.3.0, if service data is downloaded from LXCA, a non-administrative user may have access to password information for users that have previously authenticated to the LXCA's internal LDAP server, including administrative accounts and service accounts with administrative privileges. This is an issue only for users who have used local authentication with LXCA and not remote authentication against external LDAP or ADFS servers.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
