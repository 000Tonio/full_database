A vulnerability in Swagger-Parser's (version <= 1.0.30) yaml parsing functionality results in arbitrary code being executed when a maliciously crafted yaml Open-API specification is parsed. This in particular, affects the 'generate' and 'validate' command in swagger-codegen (<= 2.2.2) and can lead to arbitrary code being executed when these commands are used on a well-crafted yaml specification.
