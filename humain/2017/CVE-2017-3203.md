# CVE-2017-3203

- Published: 2018-06-11T17:29:00

The Java implementations of AMF3 deserializers in Pivotal/Spring Spring-flex derive class instances from java.io.Externalizable rather than the AMF3 specification's recommendation of flash.utils.IExternalizable. A remote attacker with the ability to spoof or control an RMI server connection may be able to send serialized Java objects that execute arbitrary code when deserialized.
