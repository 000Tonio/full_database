net/netfilter/nfnetlink_cthelper.c in the Linux kernel through 4.14.4 does not require the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability for new, get, and del operations, which allows local users to bypass intended access restrictions because the nfnl_cthelper_list data structure is shared across all net namespaces.

### CVSS Score: **4.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |
