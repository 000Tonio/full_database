The getUserzoneCookie function in Kaltura before 13.2.0 uses a hardcoded cookie secret to validate cookie signatures, which allows remote attackers to bypass an intended protection mechanism and consequently conduct PHP object injection attacks and execute arbitrary PHP code via a crafted userzone cookie.
