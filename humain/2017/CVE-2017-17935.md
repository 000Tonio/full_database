# CVE-2017-17935

- Published: 2017-12-27T17:08:00

- Modified: 2019-10-03T00:03:00

The File_read_line function in epan/wslua/wslua_file.c in Wireshark through 2.2.11 does not properly strip '\n' characters, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer underflow and application crash) via a crafted packet that triggers the attempted processing of an empty line.

### CVSS Score: **5**
