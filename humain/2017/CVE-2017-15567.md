** DISPUTED ** The certificate import component in IDEMIA (formerly Morpho) MorphoSmart 1300 Series (aka MSO 1300 Series) devices allows local users to obtain a command shell, and consequently gain privileges, via unspecified vectors.  NOTE: the vendor disputes this because there is no command shell in the product or in the associated SDK.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
