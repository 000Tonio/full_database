Notepad++ 7.3.3 (32-bit) with Hex Editor Plugin v0.9.5 might allow user-assisted attackers to execute code via a crafted file, because of a "Data from Faulting Address controls Code Flow" issue. One threat model is a victim who obtains an untrusted crafted file from a remote location and issues several user-defined commands.
