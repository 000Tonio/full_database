Dahua IP Camera devices 3.200.0001.6 can be exploited via these steps: 1. Use the default low-privilege credentials to list all users via a request to a certain URI. 2. Login to the IP camera with admin credentials so as to obtain full control of the target IP camera. During exploitation, the first JSON object encountered has a "Component error: login challenge!" message. The second JSON object encountered has a result indicating a successful admin login.
