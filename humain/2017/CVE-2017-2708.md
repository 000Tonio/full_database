The 'Find Phone' function in Nice smartphones with software versions earlier before Nice-AL00C00B0135 has an authentication bypass vulnerability. An unauthenticated attacker may wipe and factory reset the phone by special steps. Due to missing authentication of the 'Find Phone' function, an attacker may exploit the vulnerability to bypass the 'Find Phone' function in order to use the phone normally.
