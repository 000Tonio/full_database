bareos-dir, bareos-fd, and bareos-sd in bareos-core in Bareos 16.2.6 and earlier create a PID file after dropping privileges to a non-root account, which might allow local users to kill arbitrary processes by leveraging access to this non-root account for PID file modification before a root script executes a "kill `cat /pathname`" command.
