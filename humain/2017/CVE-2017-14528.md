# CVE-2017-14528

- Published: 2017-09-18T00:29:00

- Modified: 2021-03-04T20:34:00

The TIFFSetProfiles function in coders/tiff.c in ImageMagick 7.0.6 has incorrect expectations about whether LibTIFF TIFFGetField return values imply that data validation has occurred, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free after an invalid call to TIFFSetField, and application crash) via a crafted file.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
