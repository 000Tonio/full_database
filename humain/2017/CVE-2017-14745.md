The *_get_synthetic_symtab functions in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29, interpret a -1 value as a sorting count instead of an error flag, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted ELF file, related to elf32-i386.c and elf64-x86-64.c.
