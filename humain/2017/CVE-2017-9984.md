The snd_msnd_interrupt function in sound/isa/msnd/msnd_pinnacle.c in the Linux kernel through 4.11.7 allows local users to cause a denial of service (over-boundary access) or possibly have unspecified other impact by changing the value of a message queue head pointer between two kernel reads of that value, aka a "double fetch" vulnerability.
