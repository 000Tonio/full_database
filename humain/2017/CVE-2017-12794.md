# CVE-2017-12794

- Published: 2017-09-07T13:29:00

In Django 1.10.x before 1.10.8 and 1.11.x before 1.11.5, HTML autoescaping was disabled in a portion of the template for the technical 500 debug page. Given the right circumstances, this allowed a cross-site scripting attack. This vulnerability shouldn't affect most production sites since you shouldn't run with "DEBUG = True" (which makes this page accessible) in your production settings.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
