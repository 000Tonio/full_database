# CVE-2017-9378

- Published: 2017-06-02T15:29:00

BigTree CMS through 4.2.18 does not prevent a user from deleting their own account. This could have security relevance because deletion was supposed to be an admin-only action, and the admin may have other tasks (such as data backups) to complete before a user is deleted.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
