In Knox SDS IAM (Identity Access Management) and EMM (Enterprise Mobility Management) 16.11 on Samsung mobile devices, a man-in-the-middle attacker can install any application into the Knox container (without the user's knowledge) by inspecting network traffic from a Samsung server and injecting content at a certain point in the update sequence. This installed application can further leak information stored inside the Knox container to the outside world.
