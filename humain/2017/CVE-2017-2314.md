Receipt of a malformed BGP OPEN message may cause the routing protocol daemon (rpd) process to crash and restart. By continuously sending specially crafted BGP OPEN messages, an attacker can repeatedly crash the rpd process causing prolonged denial of service.

Affected releases are Juniper Networks Junos OS 12.3 prior to 12.3R12-S4, 12.3R13, 12.3R3-S4; 12.3X48 prior to 12.3X48-D50; 13.3 prior to 13.3R4-S11, 13.3R10; 14.1 prior to 14.1R8-S3, 14.1R9; 14.1X53 prior to 14.1X53-D40; 14.1X55 prior to 14.1X55-D35; 14.2 prior to 14.2R4-S7, 14.2R6-S4, 14.2R7; 15.1 prior to 15.1F2-S11, 15.1F4-S1-J1, 15.1F5-S3, 15.1F6, 15.1R4; 15.1X49 prior to 15.1X49-D100; 15.1X53 prior to 15.1X53-D33, 15.1X53-D50.
