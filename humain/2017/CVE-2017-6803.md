Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the web interface in the Scheduler in SolarWinds (formerly Serv-U) FTP Voyager 16.2.0 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of users for requests that (1) change the admin password, (2) terminate the scheduler, or (3) possibly execute arbitrary commands via crafted requests to Admin/XML/Result.xml.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
