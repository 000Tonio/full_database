# CVE-2017-7725

- Published: 2017-04-13T17:59:00

- Modified: 2021-07-15T20:42:00

concrete5 8.1.0 places incorrect trust in the HTTP Host header during caching, if the administrator did not define a "canonical" URL on installation of concrete5 using the "Advanced Options" settings. Remote attackers can make a GET request with any domain name in the Host header; this is stored and allows for arbitrary domains to be set for certain links displayed to subsequent visitors, potentially an XSS vector.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
