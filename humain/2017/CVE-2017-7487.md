The ipxitf_ioctl function in net/ipx/af_ipx.c in the Linux kernel through 4.11.1 mishandles reference counts, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a failed SIOCGIFADDR ioctl call for an IPX interface.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
