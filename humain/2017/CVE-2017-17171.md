Some Huawei smart phones have the denial of service (DoS) vulnerability due to the improper processing of malicious parameters. An attacker may trick a target user into installing a malicious APK and launch attacks using a pre-installed app with specific permissions. Successful exploit could allow the app to send specific parameters to the smart phone driver, which will result in system restart.
