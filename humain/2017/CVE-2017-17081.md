The gmc_mmx function in libavcodec/x86/mpegvideodsp.c in FFmpeg 2.3 and 3.4 does not properly validate widths and heights, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (integer signedness error and out-of-array read) via a crafted MPEG file.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
