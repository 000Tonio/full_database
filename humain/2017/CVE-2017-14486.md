The Vibease Wireless Remote Vibrator app for Android and the Vibease Chat app for iOS use cleartext to exchange messages with other apps and the PLAIN SASL mechanism to send auth tokens to Vibease servers, which allows remote attackers to obtain user credentials, messages, and other sensitive information by sniffing the network for XMPP traffic.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
