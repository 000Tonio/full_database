An issue was discovered on D-Link DIR-605L Model B before FW2.11betaB06_hbrf devices, related to the code that handles the authentication values for HNAP. An attacker can cause a denial of service (device crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact by sending a sufficiently long string in the password field of the HTTP Basic Authentication section of the HTTP request.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
