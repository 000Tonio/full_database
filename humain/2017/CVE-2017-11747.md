main.c in Tinyproxy 1.8.4 and earlier creates a /run/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.pid file after dropping privileges to a non-root account, which might allow local users to kill arbitrary processes by leveraging access to this non-root account for tinyproxy.pid modification before a root script executes a "kill `cat /run/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.pid`" command.

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
