# CVE-2017-8055

- Published: 2017-04-22T22:59:00

- Modified: 2019-10-03T00:03:00

WatchGuard Fireware allows user enumeration, e.g., in the Firebox XML-RPC login handler. A login request that contains a blank password sent to the XML-RPC agent in Fireware v11.12.1 and earlier returns different responses for valid and invalid usernames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to enumerate valid usernames on an affected Firebox.
