# CVE-2017-5990

- Published: 2017-02-15T06:59:00

- Modified: 2017-03-01T23:05:00

An issue was discovered in PhreeBooksERP before 2017-02-13. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data in the "form" HTTP GET parameter passed to the "PhreeBooksERP-master/extensions/ShippingMethods/ups/label_mgr/js_include.php" and "PhreeBooksERP-master/extensions/ShippingMethods/yrc/label_mgr/js_include.php" URLs. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of the vulnerable website. NOTE: these js_include.php files do not exist in the SourceForge "stable release" (aka R37RC1).
