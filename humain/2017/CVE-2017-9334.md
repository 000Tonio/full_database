# CVE-2017-9334

- Published: 2017-06-01T05:29:00

- Modified: 2020-08-05T16:37:00

An incorrect "pair?" check in the Scheme "length" procedure results in an unsafe pointer dereference in all CHICKEN Scheme versions prior to 4.13, which allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by passing an improper list to an application that calls "length" on it.

### CVSS Score: **5**
