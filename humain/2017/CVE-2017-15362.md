osTicket 1.10.1 allows arbitrary client-side JavaScript code execution on victims who click a crafted support/scp/tickets.php?status= link, aka XSS. Session ID and data theft may follow as well as the possibility of bypassing CSRF protections, injection of iframes to establish communication channels, etc. The vulnerability is present after login into the application. This affects a different tickets.php file than CVE-2015-1176.
