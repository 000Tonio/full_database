# CVE-2017-11472

- Published: 2017-07-20T04:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-03T00:03:00

The acpi_ns_terminate() function in drivers/acpi/acpica/nsutils.c in the Linux kernel before 4.12 does not flush the operand cache and causes a kernel stack dump, which allows local users to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory and bypass the KASLR protection mechanism (in the kernel through 4.9) via a crafted ACPI table.

### CVSS Score: **3.6**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
