SYN Flood or FIN Flood attack in ECos 1 and other versions embedded devices results in web Authentication Bypass. "eCos Embedded Web Servers used by Multiple Routers and Home devices, while sending SYN Flood or FIN Flood packets fails to validate and handle the packets and does not ask for any sign of authentication resulting in Authentication Bypass. An attacker can take complete advantage of this bug and take over the device remotely or locally. The bug has been successfully tested and reproduced in some versions of SOHO Routers manufactured by TOTOLINK, GREATEK and others."
