In some circumstances, an F5 BIG-IP version 12.0.0 to 12.1.2 and 13.0.0 Azure cloud instance may contain a default administrative password which could be used to remotely log into the BIG-IP system. The impacted administrative account is the Azure instance administrative user that was created at deployment. The root and admin accounts are not vulnerable. An attacker may be able to remotely access the BIG-IP host via SSH.
