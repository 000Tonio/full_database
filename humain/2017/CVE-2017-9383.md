# CVE-2017-9383

An issue was discovered on Vera VeraEdge 1.7.19 and Veralite 1.7.481 devices. The device provides UPnP services that are available on port 3480 and can also be accessed via port 80 using the url "/port_3480". It seems that the UPnP services provide "wget" as one of the service actions for a normal user to connect the device to an external website. It retrieves the parameter "URL" from the query string and then passes it to an internal function that uses the curl module on the device to retrieve the contents of the website.
