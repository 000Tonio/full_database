In EMC RSA Authentication Manager 8.2 SP1 and earlier, a malicious RSA Security Console Administrator could craft a token profile and store the profile name in the RSA Authentication Manager database. The profile name could include a crafted script (with an XSS payload) that could be executed when viewing or editing the assigned token profile in the token by another administrator's browser session.
