Repeated crashes of PFE processing can result in an extended denial of service condition. This issue only affects the following platforms: (1) EX2200, EX3300, XRE200 (2) MX Series routers with MPC7E/8E/9E PFEs installed, and only if 'extended-statistics' are enabled under the [edit chassis] configuration.
