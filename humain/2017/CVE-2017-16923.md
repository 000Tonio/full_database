Command Injection vulnerability in app_data_center on Shenzhen Tenda Ac9 US_AC9V1.0BR_V15.03.05.14_multi_TD01, Ac9 ac9_kf_V15.03.05.19(6318_)_cn, Ac15 US_AC15V1.0BR_V15.03.05.18_multi_TD01, Ac15 US_AC15V1.0BR_V15.03.05.19_multi_TD01, Ac18 US_AC18V1.0BR_V15.03.05.05_multi_TD01, and Ac18 ac18_kf_V15.03.05.19(6318_)_cn devices allows remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands via a crafted cgi-bin/luci/usbeject?dev_name= GET request from the LAN. This occurs because the "sub_A6E8 usbeject_process_entry" function executes a system function with untrusted input.
