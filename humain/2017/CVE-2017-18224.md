- Published: 2018-03-12T03:29:00

- Modified: 2018-05-03T01:29:00

In the Linux kernel before 4.15, fs/ocfs2/aops.c omits use of a semaphore and consequently has a race condition for access to the extent tree during read operations in DIRECT mode, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (BUG) by modifying a certain e_cpos field.

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
