In FFmpeg 2.4 and 3.3.3, the read_data function in libavformat/hls.c does not restrict reload attempts for an insufficient list, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop).

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
