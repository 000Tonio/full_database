An attacker could send an authenticated HTTP request to trigger this vulnerability in Insteon Hub running firmware version 1012. At 0x9d01c0e8 the value for the s_dport key is copied using strcpy to the buffer at 0xa000180c. This buffer is 6 bytes large, sending anything longer will cause a buffer overflow.

### CVSS Score: **8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | COMPLETE |
