In DisplayFtmItem in the bootloader, there is an out-of-bounds write due to reading a string without verifying that it's null-terminated. This could lead to a secure boot bypass and a local elevation of privilege enabling code execution as a privileged process with no additional execution privileges needed. User interaction is not needed for exploitation. Product: Android. Versions: Android kernel. Android ID: A-68269077.
