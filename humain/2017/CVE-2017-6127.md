Multiple cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities in the access portal on the DIGISOL DG-HR1400 Wireless Router with firmware 1.00.02 allow remote attackers to hijack the authentication of administrators for requests that (1) change the SSID, (2) change the Wi-Fi password, or (3) possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted requests to form2WlanBasicSetup.cgi.
