# CVE-2017-6814

- Published: 2017-03-12T01:59:00

- Modified: 2019-03-19T13:24:00

In WordPress before 4.7.3, there is authenticated Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Media File Metadata. This is demonstrated by both (1) mishandling of the playlist shortcode in the wp_playlist_shortcode function in wp-includes/media.php and (2) mishandling of meta information in the renderTracks function in wp-includes/js/mediaelement/wp-playlist.js.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
