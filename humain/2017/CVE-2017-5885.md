- Published: 2017-02-28T18:59:00

Multiple integer overflows in the (1) vnc_connection_server_message and (2) vnc_color_map_set functions in gtk-vnc before 0.7.0 allow remote servers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors involving SetColorMapEntries, which triggers a buffer overflow.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
