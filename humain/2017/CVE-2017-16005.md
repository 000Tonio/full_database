# CVE-2017-16005

Http-signature is a "Reference implementation of Joyent's HTTP Signature Scheme". In versions <=0.9.11, http-signature signs only the header values, but not the header names. This makes http-signature vulnerable to header forgery. Thus, if an attacker can intercept a request, he can swap header names and change the meaning of the request without changing the signature.
