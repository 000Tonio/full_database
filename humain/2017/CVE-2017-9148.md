# CVE-2017-9148

- Published: 2017-05-29T17:29:00

- Modified: 2018-01-05T02:31:00

The TLS session cache in FreeRADIUS 2.1.1 through 2.1.7, 3.0.x before 3.0.14, 3.1.x before 2017-02-04, and 4.0.x before 2017-02-04 fails to reliably prevent resumption of an unauthenticated session, which allows remote attackers (such as malicious 802.1X supplicants) to bypass authentication via PEAP or TTLS.

### CVSS Score: **7.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | PARTIAL | PARTIAL |
