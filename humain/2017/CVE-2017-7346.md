- Published: 2017-03-30T23:59:00

The vmw_gb_surface_define_ioctl function in drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_surface.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.7 does not validate certain levels data, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (system hang) via a crafted ioctl call for a /dev/dri/renderD* device.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
