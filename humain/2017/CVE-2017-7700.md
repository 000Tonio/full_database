# CVE-2017-7700

- Published: 2017-04-12T23:59:00

- Modified: 2019-10-03T00:03:00

In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.5 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.11, the NetScaler file parser could go into an infinite loop, triggered by a malformed capture file. This was addressed in wiretap/netscaler.c by ensuring a nonzero record size.
