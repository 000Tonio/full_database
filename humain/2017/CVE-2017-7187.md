# CVE-2017-7187

- Published: 2017-03-20T14:59:00

- Modified: 2023-02-10T00:53:00

The sg_ioctl function in drivers/scsi/sg.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.4 allows local users to cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a large command size in an SG_NEXT_CMD_LEN ioctl call, leading to out-of-bounds write access in the sg_write function.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
