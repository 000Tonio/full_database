A Padding Oracle exists in OSCI-Transport 1.2 as used in OSCI Transport Library 1.6.1 (Java) and OSCI Transport Library 1.6 (.NET). Under an MITM condition within the OSCI infrastructure, an attacker needs to send crafted protocol messages to analyse the CBC mode padding in order to decrypt the transport encryption.
