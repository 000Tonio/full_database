NixOS 17.03 and earlier has an unintended default absence of SSL Certificate Validation for LDAP. The users.ldap NixOS module implements user authentication against LDAP servers via a PAM module. It was found that if TLS is enabled to connect to the LDAP server with users.ldap.useTLS, peer verification will be unconditionally disabled in /etc/ldap.conf.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
