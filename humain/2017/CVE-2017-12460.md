An issue was discovered in Barco ClickShare CSM-1 firmware before v1.7.0.3 and CSC-1 firmware before v1.10.0.10.  An authenticated user can manage the wallpaper collection in the webUI to be shown as background on the ClickShare product.  By uploading a wallpaper with a specially crafted name, an HTML injection can be triggered as special characters are not neutralized before output.
