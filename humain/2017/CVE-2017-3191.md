# CVE-2017-3191

- Published: 2017-12-16T02:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-09T23:27:00

D-Link DIR-130 firmware version 1.23 and DIR-330 firmware version 1.12 are vulnerable to authentication bypass of the remote login page. A remote attacker that can access the remote management login page can manipulate the POST request in such a manner as to access some administrator-only pages such as tools_admin.asp without credentials.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
