# CVE-2017-14105

- Published: 2017-09-01T17:29:00

HiveManager Classic through 8.1r1 allows arbitrary JSP code execution by modifying a backup archive before a restore, because the restore feature does not validate pathnames within the archive. An authenticated, local attacker - even restricted as a tenant - can add a jsp at HiveManager/tomcat/webapps/hm/domains/$yourtenant/maps (it will be exposed at the web interface).

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
