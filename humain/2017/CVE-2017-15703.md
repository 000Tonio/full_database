# CVE-2017-15703

- Published: 2018-01-25T21:29:00

Any authenticated user (valid client certificate but without ACL permissions) could upload a template which contained malicious code and caused a denial of service via Java deserialization attack. The fix to properly handle Java deserialization was applied on the Apache NiFi 1.4.0 release. Users running a prior 1.x release should upgrade to the appropriate release.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
