The attacker would need to be authenticated and have a valid session with the Web Bridge. Affected Products: This vulnerability affects Cisco Meeting Server software releases prior to 2.1.2. This product was previously known as Acano Conferencing Server. More Information: CSCvc89551. Known Affected Releases: 2.0 2.0.7 2.1. Known Fixed Releases: 2.1.2.
