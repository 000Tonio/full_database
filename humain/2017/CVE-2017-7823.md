# CVE-2017-7823

- Published: 2018-06-11T21:29:00

- Modified: 2018-08-09T16:24:00

The content security policy (CSP) "sandbox" directive did not create a unique origin for the document, causing it to behave as if the "allow-same-origin" keyword were always specified. This could allow a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack to be launched from unsafe content. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 56, Firefox ESR < 52.4, and Thunderbird < 52.4.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
