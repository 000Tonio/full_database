In Redmine before 3.2.7 and 3.3.x before 3.3.4, the reminders function in app/models/mailer.rb does not check whether an issue is visible, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain sensitive information by reading e-mail reminder messages.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
