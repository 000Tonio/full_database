Ubiquiti UCRM versions 2.3.0 to 2.7.7 allow an authenticated user to read arbitrary files in the local file system. Note that by default, the local file system is isolated in a docker container. Successful exploitation requires valid credentials to an account with "Edit" access to "System Customization".

### CVSS Score: **1.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
