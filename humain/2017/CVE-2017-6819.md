In WordPress before 4.7.3, there is cross-site request forgery (CSRF) in Press This (wp-admin/includes/class-wp-press-this.php), leading to excessive use of server resources. The CSRF can trigger an outbound HTTP request for a large file that is then parsed by Press This.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |

| NONE | NONE | PARTIAL |
