The grub_memmove function in shlr/grub/kern/misc.c in radare2 1.5.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file, possibly related to a read overflow in the grub_disk_read_small_real function in kern/disk.c in GNU GRUB 2.02.
