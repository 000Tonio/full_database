** DISPUTED ** HikVision Wi-Fi IP cameras, when used in a wired configuration, allow physically proximate attackers to trigger association with an arbitrary access point by leveraging a default SSID with no WiFi encryption or authentication. NOTE: Vendor states that this is not a vulnerability, but more an increase to the attack surface of the product.

### CVSS Score: **3.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
