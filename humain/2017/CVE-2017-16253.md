An exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the PubNub message handler Insteon Hub 2245-222 - Firmware version 1012 for the cc channel of Insteon Hub running firmware version 1012. Specially crafted commands sent through the PubNub service can cause a stack-based buffer overflow overwriting arbitrary data. An attacker can send an authenticated HTTP request At 0x9d014dd8 the value for the id key is copied using strcpy to the buffer at $sp+0x290. This buffer is 32 bytes large, sending anything longer will cause a buffer overflow.
