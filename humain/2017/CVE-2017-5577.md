# CVE-2017-5577

- Published: 2017-02-06T06:59:00

- Modified: 2017-02-08T18:32:00

The vc4_get_bcl function in drivers/gpu/drm/vc4/vc4_gem.c in the VideoCore DRM driver in the Linux kernel before 4.9.7 does not set an errno value upon certain overflow detections, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (incorrect pointer dereference and OOPS) via inconsistent size values in a VC4_SUBMIT_CL ioctl call.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
