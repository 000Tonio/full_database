Biscom Secure File Transfer is vulnerable to cross-site scripting in the File Name field. An authenticated user with permissions to upload or send files can populate this field with a filename that contains standard HTML scripting tags. The resulting script will evaluated by any other authenticated user who views the attacker-supplied file name. All versions of SFT prior to 5.1.1028 are affected. The fix version is 5.1.1028.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
