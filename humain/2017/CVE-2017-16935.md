# CVE-2017-16935

- Published: 2017-11-24T07:29:00

Ametys before 4.0.3 requires authentication only for URIs containing a /cms/ substring, which allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via a direct request to /plugins/core-ui/servercomm/messages.xml, as demonstrated by changing the admin password by obtaining account details via a users/search.json request, and then modifying the account via an editUser request.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
