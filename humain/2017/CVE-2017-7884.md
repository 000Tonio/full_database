In Adam Kropelin adk0212 APC UPS Daemon through 3.14.14, the default installation of APCUPSD allows a local authenticated, but unprivileged, user to run arbitrary code with elevated privileges by replacing the service executable apcupsd.exe with a malicious executable that will run with SYSTEM privileges at startup. This occurs because of "RW NT AUTHORITY\Authenticated Users" permissions for %SYSTEMDRIVE%\apcupsd\bin\apcupsd.exe.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
