The bmp_read_info_header function in bin/jp2/convertbmp.c in OpenJPEG 2.2.0 does not reject headers with a zero biBitCount, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory allocation failure) in the opj_image_create function in lib/openjp2/image.c, related to the opj_aligned_alloc_n function in opj_malloc.c.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
