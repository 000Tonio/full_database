The package manager in Sitecore CRM 8.1 Rev 151207 allows remote authenticated administrators to execute arbitrary ASP code by creating a ZIP archive in which a .asp file has a ..\ in its pathname, visiting sitecore/shell/applications/install/dialogs/Upload%20Package/UploadPackage2.aspx to upload this archive and extract its contents, and visiting a URI under sitecore/ to execute the .asp file.
