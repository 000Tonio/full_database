# CVE-2017-14956

- Published: 2017-10-18T18:29:00

AlienVault USM v5.4.2 and earlier offers authenticated users the functionality of exporting generated reports via the "/ossim/report/wizard_email.php" script. Besides offering an export via a local download, the script also offers the possibility to send out any report via email to a given address (either in PDF or XLS format). Since there is no anti-CSRF token protecting this functionality, it is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.

### CVSS Score: **3.5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
