# CVE-2017-14705

- Published: 2017-09-22T18:29:00

DenyAll WAF before 6.4.1 allows unauthenticated remote command execution via TCP port 3001 because shell metacharacters can be inserted into the type parameter to the tailDateFile function in /webservices/stream/tail.php. An iToken authentication parameter is required but can be obtained by exploiting CVE-2017-14706. This affects DenyAll i-Suite LTS 5.5.0 through 5.5.12, i-Suite 5.6, Web Application Firewall 5.7, and Web Application Firewall 6.x before 6.4.1, with On Premises or AWS/Azure cloud deployments.

### CVSS Score: **9.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
