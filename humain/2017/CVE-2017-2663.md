It was found that subscription-manager's DBus interface before 1.19.4 let unprivileged user access the com.redhat.RHSM1.Facts.GetFacts and com.redhat.RHSM1.Config.Set methods. An unprivileged local attacker could use these methods to gain access to private information, or launch a privilege escalation attack.
