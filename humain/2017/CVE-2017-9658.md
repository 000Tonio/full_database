Certain 802.11 network management messages have been determined to invoke wireless access point blacklisting security defenses when not required, which can necessitate intervention by hospital staff to reset the device and reestablish a network connection to the Wi-Fi access point. During this state, the Philips IntelliVue MX40 Version B.06.18 can either connect to an alternative access point within signal range for association to a central monitoring station, or it can remain in local monitoring mode until the device is reset by hospital staff. CVSS v3 base score: 6.5, CVSS vector string: AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H. Philips has released software update, Version B.06.18, to fix the improper cleanup on thrown exception vulnerability, and implement mitigations to reduce the risk associated with the improper handling of exceptional conditions vulnerability. The software update implements messaging and alarming on the MX40 and at the central monitoring station, when the MX40 disconnects from the access point.
