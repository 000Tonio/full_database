A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue was discovered in reasoncms before 4.7.1. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data (nyroModalSel) passed to the "reasoncms-master/www/nyroModal/demoSent.php" URL. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of the vulnerable website.
