An issue was discovered on the NEC Aterm WG2600HP2 1.0.2. The router has a set of web service APIs for access to and setup of the configuration. Some APIs don't require authentication. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to retrieve DHCP clients, firmware version, and network status (ex.: curl -X http://[IP]/aterm_httpif.cgi/negotiate -d "REQ_ID=SUPPORT_IF_GET").

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
