Bluetooth module in some Huawei mobile phones with software LON-AL00BC00B229 and earlier versions has a buffer overflow vulnerability. Due to insufficient input validation, an unauthenticated attacker may craft Bluetooth AVDTP/AVCTP messages after successful paring, causing buffer overflow. Successful exploit may cause code execution.
