- Published: 2018-07-27T19:29:00

- Modified: 2023-02-12T23:29:00

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's handling of clearing SELinux attributes on /proc/pid/attr files before 4.9.10. An empty (null) write to this file can crash the system by causing the system to attempt to access unmapped kernel memory.
