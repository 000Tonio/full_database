BigTree CMS through 4.2.17 relies on a substring check for CSRF protection, which allows remote attackers to bypass this check by placing the required admin/developer/ URI within a query string in an HTTP Referer header. This was found in core/admin/modules/developer/_header.php and patched in core/inc/bigtree/admin.php on 2017-04-14.
