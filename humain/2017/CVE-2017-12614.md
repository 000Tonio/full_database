It was noticed an XSS in certain 404 pages that could be exploited to perform an XSS attack. Chrome will detect this as a reflected XSS attempt and prevent the page from loading. Firefox and other browsers don't, and are vulnerable to this attack. Mitigation: The fix for this is to upgrade to Apache Airflow 1.9.0 or above.
