opcodes/rx-decode.opc in GNU Binutils 2.28 lacks bounds checks for certain scale arrays, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted binary file, as demonstrated by mishandling of this file during "objdump -D" execution.
