The traverseStrictSanitize function in admin_dir/includes/classes/AdminRequestSanitizer.php in ZenCart 1.5.5e mishandles key strings, which allows remote authenticated users to execute arbitrary PHP code by placing that code into an invalid array index of the admin_name array parameter to admin_dir/login.php, if there is an export of an error-log entry for that invalid array index.
