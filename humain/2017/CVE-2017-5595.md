- Published: 2017-02-06T17:59:00

- Modified: 2017-02-16T14:09:00

A file disclosure and inclusion vulnerability exists in web/views/file.php in ZoneMinder 1.x through v1.30.0 because of unfiltered user-input being passed to readfile(), which allows an authenticated attacker to read local system files (e.g., /etc/passwd) in the context of the web server user (www-data). The attack vector is a .. (dot dot) in the path parameter within a zm/index.php?view=file&path= request.

### CVSS Score: **2.1**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
