Biscom Secure File Transfer is vulnerable to AngularJS expression injection in the Display Name field. An authenticated user can populate this field with a valid AngularJS expression, wrapped in double curly-braces ({{ }}). This expression will be evaluated by any other authenticated user who views the attacker's display name. Affected versions are 5.0.0000 through 5.1.1026. The Issue is fixed in 5.1.1028.

### CVSS Score: **4**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SINGLE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
