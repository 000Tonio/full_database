The Symantec Messaging Gateway, when processing a specific email attachment, can allow a malformed or corrupted Word file with a potentially malicious macro through despite the administrator having the 'disarm' functionality enabled. This constitutes a 'bypass' of the disarm functionality resident to the application.
