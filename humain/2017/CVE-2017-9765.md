# CVE-2017-9765

- Published: 2017-07-20T00:29:00

Integer overflow in the soap_get function in Genivia gSOAP 2.7.x and 2.8.x before 2.8.48, as used on Axis cameras and other devices, allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (stack-based buffer overflow and application crash) via a large XML document, aka Devil's Ivy. NOTE: the large document would be blocked by many common web-server configurations on general-purpose computers.
