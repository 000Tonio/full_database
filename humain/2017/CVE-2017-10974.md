Yaws 1.91 allows Unauthenticated Remote File Disclosure via HTTP Directory Traversal with /%5C../ to port 8080. NOTE: this CVE is only about use of an initial /%5C sequence to defeat traversal protection mechanisms; the initial /%5C sequence was apparently not discussed in earlier research on this product.
