# CVE-2017-3206

- Published: 2018-06-11T17:29:00

The Java implementation of AMF3 deserializers used by Flamingo amf-serializer by Exadel, version 2.2.0, allows external entity references (XXEs) from XML documents embedded within AMF3 messages. If the XML parsing is handled incorrectly it could potentially expose sensitive data on the server, denial of service, or server side request forgery.
