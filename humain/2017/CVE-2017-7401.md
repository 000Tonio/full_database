Incorrect interaction of the parse_packet() and parse_part_sign_sha256() functions in network.c in collectd 5.7.1 and earlier allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop) of a collectd instance (configured with "SecurityLevel None" and with empty "AuthFile" options) via a crafted UDP packet.
