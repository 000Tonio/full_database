The Comcast firmware on Cisco DPC3939 (firmware version dpc3939-P20-18-v303r20421733-160420a-CMCST); Cisco DPC3939 (firmware version dpc3939-P20-18-v303r20421746-170221a-CMCST); Cisco DPC3939B (firmware version dpc3939b-v303r204217-150321a-CMCST); Cisco DPC3941T (firmware version DPC3941_2.5s3_PROD_sey); and Arris TG1682G (eMTA&DOCSIS version 10.0.132.SIP.PC20.CT, software version TG1682_2.2p7s2_PROD_sey) devices allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a specific (but unstated) exposed service. NOTE: the scope of this CVE does NOT include the concept of "Unnecessary Services" in general; the scope is only a single service that is unnecessarily exposed, leading to remote code execution. The details of that service might be disclosed at a later date.
