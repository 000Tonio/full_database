iControl REST in F5 BIG-IP LTM, AAM, AFM, Analytics, APM, ASM, DNS, Link Controller, PEM, and WebSafe 12.0.0 through 12.1.2 and 13.0.0 includes a service to convert authorization BIGIPAuthCookie cookies to X-F5-Auth-Token tokens. This service does not properly re-validate cookies when making that conversion, allowing once-valid but now expired cookies to be converted to valid tokens.
