# CVE-2017-11176

- Published: 2017-07-11T23:29:00

- Modified: 2023-01-17T21:01:00

The mq_notify function in the Linux kernel through 4.11.9 does not set the sock pointer to NULL upon entry into the retry logic. During a user-space close of a Netlink socket, it allows attackers to cause a denial of service (use-after-free) or possibly have unspecified other impact.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**
