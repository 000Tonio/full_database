# CVE-2017-14429

- Published: 2017-09-13T17:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-03T00:03:00

The DHCP client on D-Link DIR-850L REV. A (with firmware through FW114WWb07_h2ab_beta1) and REV. B (with firmware through FW208WWb02) devices allows unauthenticated remote code execution as root because /etc/services/INET/inet_ipv4.php mishandles shell metacharacters, affecting generated files such as WAN-1-udhcpc.sh.

### CVSS Score: **10**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
