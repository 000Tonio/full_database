# CVE-2017-7261

- Published: 2017-03-24T21:59:00

- Modified: 2017-03-29T01:59:00

The vmw_surface_define_ioctl function in drivers/gpu/drm/vmwgfx/vmwgfx_surface.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.5 does not check for a zero value of certain levels data, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (ZERO_SIZE_PTR dereference, and GPF and possibly panic) via a crafted ioctl call for a /dev/dri/renderD* device.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
