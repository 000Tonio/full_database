A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) was discovered in ZoneMinder before 1.30.2. The vulnerability exists due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data (postLoginQuery) passed to the "ZoneMinder-master/web/skins/classic/views/js/postlogin.js.php" URL. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of the vulnerable website.
