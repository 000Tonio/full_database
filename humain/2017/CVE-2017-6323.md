The Symantec Management Console prior to ITMS 8.1 RU1, ITMS 8.0_POST_HF6, and ITMS 7.6_POST_HF7 has an issue whereby XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. This attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, server side request forgery, port scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts.
