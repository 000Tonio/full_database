# CVE-2017-7299

- Published: 2017-03-29T15:59:00

- Modified: 2017-03-31T16:28:00

The Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.28, has an invalid read (of size 8) because the code to emit relocs (bfd_elf_final_link function in bfd/elflink.c) does not check the format of the input file before trying to read the ELF reloc section header. The vulnerability leads to a GNU linker (ld) program crash.
