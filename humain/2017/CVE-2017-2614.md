# CVE-2017-2614

When updating a password in the rhvm database the ovirt-aaa-jdbc-tool tools before 1.1.3 fail to correctly check for the current password if it is expired. This would allow access to an attacker with access to change the password on accounts with expired passwords, gaining access to those accounts.
