The W3C High Resolution Time API, as implemented in various web browsers, does not consider that memory-reference times can be measured by a performance.now "Time to Tick" approach even with the https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1167489#c9 protection mechanism in place, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct AnC attacks via crafted JavaScript code.
