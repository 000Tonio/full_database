A command-injection vulnerability exists in a web application on a custom-built GoAhead web server used on Foscam, Vstarcam, and multiple white-label IP camera models. The mail-sending form in the mail.htm page allows an attacker to inject a command into the receiver1 field in the form; it will be executed with root privileges.
