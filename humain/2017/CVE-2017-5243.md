# CVE-2017-5243

- Published: 2017-06-06T16:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-09T23:28:00

The default SSH configuration in Rapid7 Nexpose hardware appliances shipped before June 2017 does not specify desired algorithms for key exchange and other important functions. As a result, it falls back to allowing ALL algorithms supported by the relevant version of OpenSSH and makes the installations vulnerable to a range of MITM, downgrade, and decryption attacks.

### CVSS Score: **6.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
