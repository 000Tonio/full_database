# CVE-2017-9074

- Published: 2017-05-19T07:29:00

- Modified: 2018-11-30T21:33:00

The IPv6 fragmentation implementation in the Linux kernel through 4.11.1 does not consider that the nexthdr field may be associated with an invalid option, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and BUG) or possibly have unspecified other impact via crafted socket and send system calls.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
