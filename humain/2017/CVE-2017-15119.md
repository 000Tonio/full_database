The Network Block Device (NBD) server in Quick Emulator (QEMU) before 2.11 is vulnerable to a denial of service issue. It could occur if a client sent large option requests, making the server waste CPU time on reading up to 4GB per request. A client could use this flaw to keep the NBD server from serving other requests, resulting in DoS.
