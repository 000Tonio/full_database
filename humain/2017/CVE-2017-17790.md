# CVE-2017-17790

- Published: 2017-12-20T09:29:00

- Modified: 2018-08-03T01:29:00

The lazy_initialize function in lib/resolv.rb in Ruby through 2.4.3 uses Kernel#open, which might allow Command Injection attacks, as demonstrated by a Resolv::Hosts::new argument beginning with a '|' character, a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-17405. NOTE: situations with untrusted input may be highly unlikely.
