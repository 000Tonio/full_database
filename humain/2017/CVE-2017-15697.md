A malicious X-ProxyContextPath or X-Forwarded-Context header containing external resources or embedded code could cause remote code execution. The fix to properly handle these headers was applied on the Apache NiFi 1.5.0 release. Users running a prior 1.x release should upgrade to the appropriate release.
