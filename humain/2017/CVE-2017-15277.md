# CVE-2017-15277

- Published: 2017-10-12T08:29:00

- Modified: 2018-10-18T10:29:00

ReadGIFImage in coders/gif.c in ImageMagick 7.0.6-1 and GraphicsMagick 1.3.26 leaves the palette uninitialized when processing a GIF file that has neither a global nor local palette. If the affected product is used as a library loaded into a process that operates on interesting data, this data sometimes can be leaked via the uninitialized palette.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |

| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
