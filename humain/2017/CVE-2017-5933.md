# CVE-2017-5933

Citrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway 10.5 before Build 65.11, 11.0 before Build 69.12/69.123, and 11.1 before Build 51.21 randomly generates GCM nonces, which makes it marginally easier for remote attackers to obtain the GCM authentication key and spoof data by leveraging a reused nonce in a session and a "forbidden attack," a similar issue to CVE-2016-0270.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
