New Relic .NET Agent before 6.3.123.0 adds SQL injection flaws to safe applications via vectors involving failure to escape quotes during use of the Slow Queries feature, as demonstrated by a mishandled quote in a VALUES clause of an INSERT statement, after bypassing a SET SHOWPLAN_ALL ON protection mechanism.
