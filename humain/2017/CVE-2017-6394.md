- Published: 2017-03-02T06:59:00

- Modified: 2020-07-10T14:02:00

Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issues were discovered in OpenEMR 5.0.0 and 5.0.1-dev. The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data passed to the "openemr-master/gacl/admin/object_search.php" URL (section_value; src_form). An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of the vulnerable website.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
