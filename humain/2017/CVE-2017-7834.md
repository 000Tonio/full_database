# CVE-2017-7834

- Published: 2018-06-11T21:29:00

- Modified: 2018-06-25T18:46:00

A "data:" URL loaded in a new tab did not inherit the Content Security Policy (CSP) of the original page, allowing for bypasses of the policy including the execution of JavaScript. In prior versions when "data:" documents also inherited the context of the original page this would allow for potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 57.
