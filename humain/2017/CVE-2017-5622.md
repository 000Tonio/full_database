With OxygenOS before 4.0.3, when a charger is connected to a powered-off OnePlus 3 or 3T device, the platform starts with adbd enabled. Therefore, a malicious charger or a physical attacker can open up, without authorization, an ADB session with the device, in order to further exploit other vulnerabilities and/or exfiltrate sensitive information.
