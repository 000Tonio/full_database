# CVE-2017-9807

- Published: 2017-06-22T03:29:00

- Modified: 2017-10-13T01:29:00

An issue was discovered in the OpenWebif plugin through 1.2.4 for E2 open devices. The saveConfig function of "plugin/controllers/models/config.py" performs an eval() call on the contents of the "key" HTTP GET parameter. This allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary Python code or OS commands via api/saveconfig.
