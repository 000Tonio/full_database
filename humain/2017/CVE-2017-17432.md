OpenAFS 1.x before 1.6.22 does not properly validate Rx ack packets, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash or application crash) via crafted fields, as demonstrated by an integer underflow and assertion failure for a small MTU value.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
