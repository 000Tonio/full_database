** DISPUTED ** The fill_input_buffer function in jdatasrc.c in libjpeg-turbo 1.5.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (invalid memory access and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted jpg file. NOTE: Maintainer asserts the issue is due to a bug in downstream code caused by misuse of the libjpeg API.
