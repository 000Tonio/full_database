OPC Foundation Local Discovery Server (LDS) 1.03.370 required a security update to resolve multiple vulnerabilities that allow attackers to trigger a crash by placing invalid data into the configuration file. This vulnerability requires an attacker with access to the file system where the configuration file is stored; however, if the configuration file is altered the LDS will be unavailable until it is repaired.
