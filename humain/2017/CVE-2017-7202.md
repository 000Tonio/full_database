Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) were discovered in SLiMS 7 Cendana before 2017-03-16. The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data (id) passed to the 'slims7_cendana-master/template/default/detail_template.php' and 'slims7_cendana-master/template/default-rtl/detail_template.php' URLs. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of the vulnerable website.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
