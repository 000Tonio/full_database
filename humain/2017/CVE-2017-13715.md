The __skb_flow_dissect function in net/core/flow_dissector.c in the Linux kernel before 4.3 does not ensure that n_proto, ip_proto, and thoff are initialized, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a single crafted MPLS packet.
