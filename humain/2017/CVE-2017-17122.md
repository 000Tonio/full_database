The dump_relocs_in_section function in objdump.c in GNU Binutils 2.29.1 does not check for reloc count integer overflows, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (excessive memory allocation, or heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted PE file.
