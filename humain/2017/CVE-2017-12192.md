# CVE-2017-12192

- Published: 2017-10-12T00:29:00

- Modified: 2023-02-12T23:28:00

The keyctl_read_key function in security/keys/keyctl.c in the Key Management subcomponent in the Linux kernel before 4.13.5 does not properly consider that a key may be possessed but negatively instantiated, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (OOPS and system crash) via a crafted KEYCTL_READ operation.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
