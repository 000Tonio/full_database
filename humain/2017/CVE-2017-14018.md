An improper authentication issue was discovered in Johnson & Johnson Ethicon Endo-Surgery Generator Gen11, all versions released before November 29, 2017. The security authentication mechanism used between the Ethicon Endo-Surgery Generator Gen11 and single-patient use products can be bypassed, allowing for unauthorized devices to be connected to the generator, which could result in a loss of integrity or availability.
