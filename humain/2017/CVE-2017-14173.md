# CVE-2017-14173

In the function ReadTXTImage() in coders/txt.c in ImageMagick 7.0.6-10, an integer overflow might occur for the addition operation "GetQuantumRange(depth)+1" when "depth" is large, producing a smaller value than expected. As a result, an infinite loop would occur for a crafted TXT file that claims a very large "max_value" value.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
