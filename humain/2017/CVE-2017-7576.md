DragonWave Horizon 1.01.03 wireless radios have hardcoded login credentials (such as the username of energetic and password of wireless) meant to allow the vendor to access the devices. These credentials can be used in the web interface or by connecting to the device via TELNET. This is fixed in recent versions including 1.4.8.
