- Published: 2017-02-06T06:59:00

The nested_vmx_check_vmptr function in arch/x86/kvm/vmx.c in the Linux kernel through 4.9.8 improperly emulates the VMXON instruction, which allows KVM L1 guest OS users to cause a denial of service (host OS memory consumption) by leveraging the mishandling of page references.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
