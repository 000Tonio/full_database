An issue was discovered on the PLANEX CS-QR20 1.30. A hidden and undocumented management page allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device when the user is authenticated. The management page was used for debugging purposes, once you login and access the page directly (/admin/system_command.asp), you can execute any command.
