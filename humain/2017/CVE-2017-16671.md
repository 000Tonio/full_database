# CVE-2017-16671

- Published: 2017-11-09T00:29:00

- Modified: 2018-11-25T11:29:00

A Buffer Overflow issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13 before 13.18.1, 14 before 14.7.1, and 15 before 15.1.1 and Certified Asterisk 13.13 before 13.13-cert7. No size checking is done when setting the user field for Party B on a CDR. Thus, it is possible for someone to use an arbitrarily large string and write past the end of the user field storage buffer. NOTE: this is different from CVE-2017-7617, which was only about the Party A buffer.
