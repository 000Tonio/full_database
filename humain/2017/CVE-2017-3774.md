A stack overflow vulnerability was discovered within the web administration service in Integrated Management Module 2 (IMM2) earlier than version 4.70 used in some Lenovo servers and earlier than version 6.60 used in some IBM servers. An attacker providing a crafted user ID and password combination can cause a portion of the authentication routine to overflow its stack, resulting in stack corruption.
