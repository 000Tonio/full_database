A remote code execution vulnerability was found within the pg module when the remote database or query specifies a specially crafted column name. There are 2 likely scenarios in which one would likely be vulnerable. 1) Executing unsafe, user-supplied sql which contains a malicious column name. 2) Connecting to an untrusted database and executing a query which returns results where any of the column names are malicious.
