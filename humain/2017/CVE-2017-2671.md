# CVE-2017-2671

- Published: 2017-04-05T06:59:00

- Modified: 2023-02-12T23:29:00

The ping_unhash function in net/ipv4/ping.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.8 is too late in obtaining a certain lock and consequently cannot ensure that disconnect function calls are safe, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic) by leveraging access to the protocol value of IPPROTO_ICMP in a socket system call.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
