On the Broadcom Wi-Fi HardMAC SoC with fbt firmware, a stack buffer overflow occurs when handling an 802.11r (FT) authentication response, leading to remote code execution via a crafted access point that sends a long R0KH-ID field in a Fast BSS Transition Information Element (FT-IE).

### CVSS Score: **8.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | ADJACENT_NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| COMPLETE | COMPLETE | COMPLETE |
