# CVE-2017-7704

- Published: 2017-04-12T23:59:00

- Modified: 2019-10-03T00:03:00

In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.5, the DOF dissector could go into an infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-dof.c by using a different integer data type and adjusting a return value.

### CVSS Score: **7.8**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
