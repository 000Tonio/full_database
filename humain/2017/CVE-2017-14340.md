# CVE-2017-14340

- Published: 2017-09-15T11:29:00

- Modified: 2017-12-07T02:29:00

The XFS_IS_REALTIME_INODE macro in fs/xfs/xfs_linux.h in the Linux kernel before 4.13.2 does not verify that a filesystem has a realtime device, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS) via vectors related to setting an RHINHERIT flag on a directory.

### CVSS Score: **4.9**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | LOCAL |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | NONE | COMPLETE |
