# CVE-2017-9538

- Published: 2017-10-03T01:29:00

The 'Upload logo from external path' function of SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor version 12.0.15300.90 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (permanent display of a "Cannot exit above the top directory" error message throughout the entire web application) via a ".." in the path field. In other words, the denial of service is caused by an incorrect implementation of a directory-traversal protection mechanism.
