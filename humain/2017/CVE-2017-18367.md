# CVE-2017-18367

- Published: 2019-04-24T21:29:00

- Modified: 2020-10-14T22:15:00

libseccomp-golang 0.9.0 and earlier incorrectly generates BPFs that OR multiple arguments rather than ANDing them. A process running under a restrictive seccomp filter that specified multiple syscall arguments could bypass intended access restrictions by specifying a single matching argument.

### CVSS Score: **5**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | LOW | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | PARTIAL | NONE |
