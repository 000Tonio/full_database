In Ivanti Service Desk (formerly LANDESK Management Suite) versions between 2016.3 and 2017.3, an Unrestricted Direct Object Reference leads to referencing/updating objects belonging to other users. In other words, a normal user can send requests to a specific URI with the target user's username in an HTTP payload in order to retrieve a key/token and use it to access/update objects belonging to other users. Such objects could be user profiles, tickets, incidents, etc.
