The pe_print_idata function in peXXigen.c in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) library (aka libbfd), as distributed in GNU Binutils 2.29, mishandles HintName vector entries, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer over-read and application crash) via a crafted PE file, related to the bfd_getl16 function.
