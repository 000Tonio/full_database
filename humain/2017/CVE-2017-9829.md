'/cgi-bin/admin/downloadMedias.cgi' of the web service in most of the VIVOTEK Network Cameras is vulnerable, which allows remote attackers to read any file on the camera's Linux filesystem via a crafted HTTP request containing ".." sequences. This vulnerability is already verified on VIVOTEK Network Camera IB8369/FD8164/FD816BA; most others have similar firmware that may be affected.
