# CVE-2017-6353

- Published: 2017-03-01T20:59:00

- Modified: 2017-11-04T01:29:00

net/sctp/socket.c in the Linux kernel through 4.10.1 does not properly restrict association peel-off operations during certain wait states, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (invalid unlock and double free) via a multithreaded application.  NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incorrect fix for CVE-2017-5986.
