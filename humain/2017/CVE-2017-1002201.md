In haml versions prior to version 5.0.0.beta.2, when using user input to perform tasks on the server, characters like < > " ' must be escaped properly. In this case, the ' character was missed. An attacker can manipulate the input to introduce additional attributes, potentially executing code.

| --- | --- | --- |
