It was found that keycloak before 3.4.2 final would permit misuse of a client-side /etc/hosts entry to spoof a URL in a password reset request. An attacker could use this flaw to craft a malicious password reset request and gain a valid reset token, leading to information disclosure or further attacks.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**
