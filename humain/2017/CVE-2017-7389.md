Multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) were discovered in 'openeclass Release_3.5.4'. The vulnerabilities exist due to insufficient filtration of user-supplied data (meeting_id, user) passed to the 'openeclass-master/modules/tc/webconf/webconf.php' URL. An attacker could execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a browser in the context of the vulnerable website.
