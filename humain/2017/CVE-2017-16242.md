An issue was discovered on MECO USB Memory Stick with Fingerprint MECOZiolsamDE601 devices. The fingerprint authentication requirement for data access can be bypassed. An attacker with physical access can send a static packet to a serial port exposed on the PCB to unlock the key and get access to the data without possessing the required fingerprint.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
