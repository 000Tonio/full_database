The ReadWPGImage function in coders/wpg.c in ImageMagick 7.0.7-9 does not properly validate the colormap index in a WPG palette, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (use of uninitialized data or invalid memory allocation) or possibly have unspecified other impact via a malformed WPG file.
