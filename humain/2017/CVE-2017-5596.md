- Published: 2017-01-25T21:59:00

In Wireshark 2.2.0 to 2.2.3 and 2.0.0 to 2.0.9, the ASTERIX dissector could go into an infinite loop, triggered by packet injection or a malformed capture file. This was addressed in epan/dissectors/packet-asterix.c by changing a data type to avoid an integer overflow. <a href="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/835.html">CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')</a>
