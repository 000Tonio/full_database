# CVE-2017-17688

- Published: 2018-05-16T19:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-03T00:03:00

** DISPUTED ** The OpenPGP specification allows a Cipher Feedback Mode (CFB) malleability-gadget attack that can indirectly lead to plaintext exfiltration, aka EFAIL. NOTE: third parties report that this is a problem in applications that mishandle the Modification Detection Code (MDC) feature or accept an obsolete packet type, not a problem in the OpenPGP specification.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
