Tor Browser before 7.0.9 on macOS and Linux allows remote attackers to bypass the intended anonymity feature and discover a client IP address via vectors involving a crafted web site that leverages file:// mishandling in Firefox, aka TorMoil. NOTE: Tails is unaffected.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
| --- | --- | --- |
| NONE | MEDIUM | NETWORK |

| confidentiality | integrity | availability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PARTIAL | NONE | NONE |
