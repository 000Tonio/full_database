In the Siemens 7KM PAC Switched Ethernet PROFINET expansion module (All versions < V2.1.3), a Denial-of-Service condition could be induced by a specially crafted PROFINET DCP packet sent as a local Ethernet (Layer 2) broadcast. The affected component requires a manual restart via the main device to recover.
