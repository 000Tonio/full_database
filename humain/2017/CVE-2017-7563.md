# CVE-2017-7563

- Published: 2017-06-07T15:29:00

- Modified: 2019-10-03T00:03:00

In ARM Trusted Firmware 1.3, RO memory is always executable at AArch64 Secure EL1, allowing attackers to bypass the MT_EXECUTE_NEVER protection mechanism. This issue occurs because of inconsistency in the number of execute-never bits (one bit versus two bits).

### CVSS Score: **6.8**
