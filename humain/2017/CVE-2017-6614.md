A vulnerability in the file-download feature of the web user interface for Cisco FindIT Network Probe Software 1.0.0 could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to download and view any system file by using the affected software. The vulnerability is due to the absence of role-based access control (RBAC) for file-download requests that are sent to the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected software. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to download and view any system file by using the affected software. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCvd11628.
