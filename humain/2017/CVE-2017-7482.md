# CVE-2017-7482

- Published: 2018-07-30T14:29:00

- Modified: 2023-02-14T21:37:00

In the Linux kernel before version 4.12, Kerberos 5 tickets decoded when using the RXRPC keys incorrectly assumes the size of a field. This could lead to the size-remaining variable wrapping and the data pointer going over the end of the buffer. This could possibly lead to memory corruption and possible privilege escalation.

### CVSS Score: **7.2**
