# CVE-2017-2625

- Published: 2018-07-27T18:29:00

- Modified: 2023-02-12T23:29:00

It was discovered that libXdmcp before 1.1.2 including used weak entropy to generate session keys. On a multi-user system using xdmcp, a local attacker could potentially use information available from the process list to brute force the key, allowing them to hijack other users' sessions.
