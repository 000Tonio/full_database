# CVE-2017-8284

- Published: 2017-04-26T14:59:00

- Modified: 2019-10-03T00:03:00

** DISPUTED ** The disas_insn function in target/i386/translate.c in QEMU before 2.9.0, when TCG mode without hardware acceleration is used, does not limit the instruction size, which allows local users to gain privileges by creating a modified basic block that injects code into a setuid program, as demonstrated by procmail. NOTE: the vendor has stated "this bug does not violate any security guarantees QEMU makes."
