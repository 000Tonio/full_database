Microsoft Edge in Microsoft Windows 10 1703, 1709, Windows Server, version 1709, and ChakraCore allows an attacker to bypass Control Flow Guard (CFG) to run arbitrary code on a target system, due to how Microsoft Edge handles accessing memory in code compiled by the Edge Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, aka "Microsoft Edge Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability".
