# CVE-2017-8244

- Published: 2017-05-12T20:29:00

In core_info_read and inst_info_read in all Android releases from CAF using the Linux kernel, variable "dbg_buf", "dbg_buf->curr" and "dbg_buf->filled_size" could be modified by different threads at the same time, but they are not protected with mutex or locks. Buffer overflow is possible on race conditions. "buffer->curr" itself could also be overwritten, which means that it may point to anywhere of kernel memory (for write).
