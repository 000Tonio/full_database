# CVE-2017-16539

- Published: 2017-11-04T17:29:00

The DefaultLinuxSpec function in oci/defaults.go in Docker Moby through 17.03.2-ce does not block /proc/scsi pathnames, which allows attackers to trigger data loss (when certain older Linux kernels are used) by leveraging Docker container access to write a "scsi remove-single-device" line to /proc/scsi/scsi, aka SCSI MICDROP.

### CVSS Score: **4.3**

| authentication | complexity | vector |
